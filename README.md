Analysis of State of the Union Addresses dataset:  
In this problem, you will analyze the “state_union_part1.txt” that contains presidential addresses.  
To do so, you will:  
Perform the following three tasks:   
• list the top 50 words by frequency (normalized by the length of the document)  
• list the top 50 bigrams by frequencies,  
• list the top 50 bigrams by their Mutual Information scores (using min frequency 5)  
Note: you will decide how to process the words, i.e. decide on tokenization and whether to use all lower case,  
use or modify the stop word list, or lemmatization. Briefly state why you chose the processing options that you did.

In this problem, you will analyze the “state_union_part2.txt”. 
The analysis tasks are as follows:  
• list the top 50 words by frequency (normalized by the length of the document)  
• list the top 50 bigrams by frequencies,  
• list the top 50 bigrams by their Mutual Information scores (using min frequency 5)
