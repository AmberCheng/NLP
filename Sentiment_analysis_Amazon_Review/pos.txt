For well over a year my son has enjoyed stacking and playing with these cars.They have held up brilliantly to his abuse - they still look like new.Fun to stack, fun to roll.My son loved this toy form the time he was teething until well after the time he got his teeth in.I ordered this as a spare for my original Co-Sleeper.There really aren't a ton of places you can buy these, so I wasn't too concerned about the price.I was quite pleased with this for the first 6 months.Now as my son's diet is changing, the odor of his bowl movements can no longer be contained.We always tightly wrap our diapers and I even tried washing it frequently but after about 3 or 4 days the stench comes right back and now I'm at a point where it's just taking too much time and effort to maintain.Our son uses the babi italia pinehurst classic crib...bought the ultimate crib sheet for it but it doesn't fit the crib very well.It is good for backup use if my other regular sheets are in the wash though.My son has been pulling up to stand and teething on the top side rails and actually made teeth marks with paint coming off!It would have cost about the same price to buy an actual[...] rail cover so it works out.The upper material is soft and smooth with adequate middle absorption so that it catches excess moisture.I used one on her crib on top of a decorative sheet, another doubled over in her playpen under a practical sheet (since the playpen pad can't be easily washed), and a third to replace whichever one she soiled most recently.The snaps work well on small crib rails.They may not fit around larger crib posts.I highly recommend this to any new mother with an appropriate crib.I had bought this sheet on the recommendation of others from Babies R Us.The waterproof backing is great not just for the diaper leaks but also for the spit-ups.The straps don't line up properly with our crib rails, so it can never be totally attached to the crib.Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs (ie: tv, chest freezer, etc) It works very well and is extremely secure.The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords.Unfortunately it still draws the attention of a 9 month old baby....but nothing gets past them anyway!It is safer to just have no wires/plugs anywhere that babies can see them but if you cant this at least makes it impossible to get to outlets.It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this.What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs!I am opening a home daycare and these are some of the only locks that are approved by the state of Washington.I really think they would be great for grandparents or anyone who has young kids visiting often because you can turn them off when the kids are not there, most other child locks do not have that feature.this thermometer is pretty consistent, but the nipple is too large for young babies.after my 2 month old gagged on this twice he started refusing his other pacifiers!I've tried this in my mouth, it isn't comfortable like regular pacifiers at all and it took so long to reach a temperature I took it out of my mouth before it was done, this was over 2 minutes so I don't even know if this thing is accurate at all.My girls were preemies and this was WAY too big for them.My girls are currently 14 months old and love their Binky pacifiers but I've tried to get them to use this to take their temps several times and they make a face & push it right out.My girls HATE & have always hated having their temperature taken under the arm pit but they do not mind it taken rectally, it IS very easy and the most accurate.I use an Exergen Temperal for when they are sleeping because it is accurate enough to let me know if they have a temp and if it is a high temp.If it shows they have a higher temp then I get them up and take their temp rectally to make sure I get the most accurate temperature.My 5 month old didn't seem to love it, but would sort of press the buttons and screw around with it.We got our twin boys this Mozart Magic Cube for Christmas, when they were 6 months old.I bought this for my 4-month old son.We got this as a baby shower gift and my son has loved it since he was about 3 months old.At first, he was fascinated with looking at the lights and hearing the music.He will hit the blue button multiple times till he gets to the song he wants to hear.She wasn't strong enough to push the button herself, so she didn't really like it.My husband, son and I all LOVE this toy.I love that he (1 year old) can be exposed to fun classical music with a toy that engages him.He loves that it all lights up (when the buttons on any side are pressed) and he has fun pressing the buttons on the different sides and seeing and hearing the difference it makes (pressing one side engages or unengages the instrument during the song).An added BIG PLUS for parents - it does have an "off" switch.They have so much fun rolling it and hitting the big buttons to make beautiful music.I love the classical music that does not sound like your typical synthetic baby music.(It does stand up to the beating, so that is a plus.)My son seems to love looking at it and pushing the buttons, I think once he is a bit older he might appreciate it more.IT looks fantastic!This is one of my son's favorite toys.He's been watching/listening to it since he was born.Got this as a gift when baby was 5 months.The quality of music is very good, not mechanically computerized like some toys.It has five or so songs and you can turn off and on each instrument.The songs are nice too, jazzy and complex enough to be interesting.It has a very solid feel, which worried me at first because I was afraid baby would hurt himself face-planting into it, but no injuries.I like this seat mostly because Elmo seems to have magical powers over little ones!You could end up with pinched fingers or a soaked tot.And the size is just right.Very sturdy and easy to clean (you can separate the cushion from the plastic, to clean separately).My toilet is not exactly the same shape (the potty seat is somewhat rounder), but it is sturdy enough so it is not a problem.We love it and I highly recommend it.There are other designs for boys as well, but the pink Dora one is great for girls this age.This is colorful, soft, and makes lots of fun sounds babies love.I know the dimensions are listed, but for some reason I was surprised at how big/long the caterpillar is.He can easily pull it to his mouth to bite on it.How FUN and AWESOME!!!Got this for my grandson and still can't get over how bright and playful this is.It was so so so simple to put up!!!Love the bigger size, while not being overwhelming...those smaller play yards just are too small to be used when you need them most...I bought one for my God child who is 6mths old and she loves it.I bought this playpen to use at my house when I babysit the grandkids.It's really colorful and large and I like the toys on the netting.Just a great playpen.It is the most colorful out there, easy to assemble and travel with.My baby is very particular, but she loves this playard.for instance, the butterfly has wings that have foil inside to make squishing sound when you touch the,m.I like it because it is huge and cute.This is a great for play.Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy.I am happy with it.Been using it with my first born and now with my 1 month old baby.Will help you prevent diaper rash.that's about all they are good for please spend the extra money on diaper service quality prefolds it will be worth it in the end.We are using this every night since we bought it.It's easy to use, look good and works great!I use to warm breastmilk.It is a lifesaver when my son wakes up and needs his expressed milk instantly.We loved it for the first month we had it.(expressing away from home, helping with engorgement, pumping extra for more supply)It works great!My kids are 4 and 6yrs now, and with the activity level in my home now, I think a quieter model will better suite everyone's needs.It actually takes a little  effort and the gate itself doesn't feel that it's truly sturdy enough for this abuse.The gate is easy to configure.When you have it set up, it feels like it's locked into place (unlike a few other large area gates I've used).Additionally, it won't be hard to take the gate off it's wall moorings should I need to temporarily remove the gate.This is a great feature.Overall this is an ok gate.I love this gate!We have a spiral staircase that continues for 3 floors and it was almost impossible to block off on the second level.First, the hinges on the gate which allow you to place the panels at an angle are not wonderful.If you're a little too forceful, it can easily break.Second, the mounting pieces for the wall are fixed position, at the top of every fence panel.Most people will have to buy extension gate panels to make this work and boy does the cost add up.The North States Gate can be placed at various angles too just like the Kidco.North States Gate needs to amp up their advertising though because it isn't quite clear that it can do the same as the Kidco Gate at a better price too.I bought thisPrince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Greyin hope of protecting my son from bumps on our coffee table.My son is 10 months and is full blown running so it was time.We measured the foam and cut accordingly to make it a tight fit.we then attached the corner pieces to the cut out parts using gorilla glue and then clear packing tape to re-enforece the hold.We were able to cover the edge at Grandma's house with ease.My daughter has tried to peel off a part, and we just stuck it back on and it's still sticking and working just fine.We've tried several different potty seats and this is the best by far:1)  Fairly easy to clean, integrated design.Highly recommended!we have a folding potty seat that we bring with us for travelling.I bought BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer to potty train my son.He likes using it, and the splash guard in the front works.This seat is awesome, it fits both elongated and normal bowls very snugly.As others have mentioned, she can place it on the toilet herself, which she really enjoys, and even helps me wipe it off after using.Even with a girl, she has managed to pee over the splash guard twice so far, but it is really a small price to pay for how clean and convenient this seat is.Kept the price reasonable.Very happy.It is very comfortable for her as well as easy for her to put on the potty herself which is important to her.My son is 3 years old and I potty trained him in 1 day.All I had to do was get rid of the diapers and buy him big boy underwear to start the potty journey.It took a day of "accidents", but it was well worth it.I highly recommend it -- no need for a potty either :).I love the dial on the back that makes it really secure on any shape seat.It fits nice and snug on top of the toilet seat with no rocking or tipping, and my son sits on it quite well with no danger of falling in or off it (he's almost 2 but he's big for his age).This lid is great for my petite 3 year old to use.This is a hard, but perfectly contoured seat for a little bottom.We have the cushioned one, with little ducks which is nice, but this is really a step up.I really liked this one enough to purchase a second for trips to grandma's.It is strong, sturdy, easy to clean.It comes in other colors, but I only have white.It is great how it adjusts to fit snugly with my lid underneath.Since my daughter is petite she has a hard time getting high enough to just sit- she has to "shimmy" and this snug lid is very safe for her to shimmy onto with out moving.Worth the extra money.To date, we have purchased 4 of these potties for our petite 14 month old daughter (upstairs, downstairs, both parents' cars), when we wanted to start to introduce toileting in a natural way.It is a tiny potty, and we were looking for one because nothing in the aisle at Target was small enough for her to sit comfortably on it.I like that it is all one piece, making it super easy to clean.It does fit well in our little bathrooms, too.We love it, baby loves it, washes easy, good price, free shipping when bought from Amazon!Great size for EC babies!Also the splash guard is important, even for girls.The other potty leaked out the front.Also it's light and easy to take to the beach or wherever we go.I wanted something that would be comfortable for her little bumbum but nothing that would distract her from the job at hand.She is 2 1/2 years old, at 29 lbs and 34 inches and is on her way to becoming fully potty trained.it is so easy to clean & take to work with me, & fits him great!This is a great potty seat and very easy to manage, however the potty disassembles quite easily from the base and does not have a cover.I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms.I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning.I have 2 of these for my twins.Having gone through the search of a good one with my first child, I found this and bought 2.This is the ONLY potty I've found that's perfect for boys!The pee-pee guard is integrated to the seat, so it won't fall off, and is high enough to "keep it all in" if you know what I mean!It's also a really good size "bowl", some are waaay too small to neatly go potty in.AWESOME potty and the only one I would ever reccomend!This potty works very well for us.It is light enough that he can move it himself, but the rubber grip on the bottom keeps it from slipping when he sits.I can see how other children may have problems bumping themselves on the splash guard, which you can't remove, but this hasn't been a problem for him.This is a very sturdy chair with a nice no-slip rubber coating around the bottom edges, and this seems like a chair that will be super easy to clean.My daughter is not quite ready for this but I am sure this is a great purchase.I am so pleased with this potty.It is very comfortable for my 2 1/2 year old.It is also very easy to keep cleaned up.I bought this based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews.My daughter is tall for her age but not particularly chunky or chubby.Sometimes when she stood up, the white part actually came up with her.I think this might be because I have a girl and not a boy, since there seems to be issue with other potty's splash guards.In my case, my daughter did not find this seat comfortable and did not take to it at all.I later bought her that Fisher Price one with the face and that sings.Again, don't have a boy so can't speak to the splash guard issue, but really this potty is nothing out of this world for me.It's collecting dust in my hallway closet right now.Everything I read said to keep the potty as basic as possible.You can't get more basic than this potty and the winning factor for me is that it is so easy to clean.There aren't any cracks or crevices you need to worry about.I bought it long before I knew my child was ready to use it and placed it in the bathroom as someplace she can hang out while Mommy was in the potty.My son is a big kid (tall, 28 lb, one year old with chubby legs) and this potty fits him perfectly.We have one for our downstairs bathroom and the kids bathroom as well as at the grandparent's house.My son is approaching 3 and can now help with that.We are big fans of this.Absolutely!While I still periodically reach for the pretty and colorful burp cloths that are specifically made for that use, they are not nearly as absorbent as these Gerber cloth diapers.My child is not even all that prone to throwing up and the other burp cloths are still not enough...These are easily washed and inexpensive... admittedly not as pretty, but most mothers get over "pretty" real quick when real life sets in and baby becomes messy all of the time!They do look gauzy, but fold them over once, and they're thick enough to absorb most of my baby's spit-ups entirely, and (apologies if this gets graphic) even a single layer is effective at catching all the chunky bits in spit-up which can cause your clothes to smell.They are so absorbent, so effective, so economical, and so handy.I have three packs, and I really needed them all when my baby was a newborn.They're extremely effective at drying dishes and wiping down counter tops.In a pinch, they make great handkerchiefs for my runny nose when I'm out for a walk with the stroller.I also fold them and put them in my baby's (all-in-one-cloth) diaper if I want to give it a bit more absorbing power.When my baby was really little, I used them on the changing pad to keep from having to change the changing pad cover constantly.Don't worry they will shrink down a little after the first wash.These are absorbent and great for burp cloths because you don't have to worry about staining them.They are very easy to wash and could potentially be bleached.After the first wash, they might not be as soft was you would wish but after a few washes this is not an issue.I have 2 packages of them and I use them every day.I have cute ones that I might use outside of the house, but these are definitely my first choice.My auntie recommended them to me and I am very thankful for that!My child at a year old can sip out of them but a lot does come out.It's a great cup that way, totally spillproof!I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away.I use to think that using the soft sippy cups  was a great transition from bottles..NOT!!I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain, anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them.I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so sillyO, by the way, I haven't reinflated it once since I bought it (about 2 months ago or so)- yes, some of the air escaped, as with all inflatables, but it's still sturdy enough.I was hoping this would be a good transition tub for my 6 month old who is growing out of the tub that fits in the sink.If you are in the same situation, I caution you with this purchase -1) It reeks like plastic and has for weeks.2) it is dangerously slippery.It's very firm so not super comfortable but I still use it.It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams.Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves.I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far, each brand's strengths were as follows:>Kushies (3star)absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers,>La Leche League (3star)appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras,>Medela (2star) was

other 2/3 of these brands can provide a more efficient answer.This review goes into more detail at "[..]This is challenging to get open and closed for the adult in the equation.But they are quite challenging to get to line up correctly and heaven forbid you need to get it back open.It does come w a couple outlet plugs for the extra slots in your power strip, I was just hoping this would work a wee bit better.If all you really need is to prevent your child from unplugging things from your power strip, than this will work for you.Covers perfectly and makes the power strip safe.This is a very useless item.I think this is a great outlet strip cover.I almost wish I had this before I had kids because it conceals it so nicely and makes the strip look much more tidy.These are great.My only complaints are: 1.Makes for easy packing and cleaning.I've been using these for almost a year and they are great.I will use the Playtex Dropin system again with my next child.These drop-ins are great quality.I would highly recommend these to others!I love these, however the measurements are inaccurate.Make sure you measure the water for the formula separate.I started the first month of motherhood washing and sterilizing bottles multiple times a day.Valuable time has been saved, now that I'm using these things instead!The only caution I have for others out there is to be very aware of the measurements.Because the liners can accommodate 8-10oz of fluid, don't trust the measurements on this.I love that it's always ready to go and that I don't have to clean a bottle and a brush and make sure that everything is clean inside.They work fine, but are basically just smaller versions of adult clippers, and don't have any safety features to keep you from cutting baby's skin.Nothing special, but they do the job if you're careful.I went to Walgreens and got a large 50 count of underlayment pads that fit perfectly on our changing table for 3.99  Please don't fall victim to the cute designs and baby marketing gimmicks.These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained!!!We received the Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot for ease of access to diapers.It attaches perfectly to the Gulliver Changing Table we have from IKEA which made me really happy.I'm curious to see how it will work with the cloth diaper inserts since we're planning on cloth diapering when our baby is out of the newborn stage.We haven't received our cloth diapers so I have yet to see.I'll post an update when I get them.I do wish it had a little larger storage for diapering supplies.It works really well for me.There's plenty of space for diapers, my wipes warmer fits on top, and I have odds and ends on the (removable) side compartments.This net does what it says.It was also a little wonky to size down the length.I wouldn't say it's too stylish either, but a person would be hard-pressed to find a stylish railing guard.I bought this tub after reviewing almost all the other comparable tubs on here!My son was 5 months old when I bought it, and he is now 14 months... it works great for us!I love that this tub is BPA free, and it cleans/dries very well.My daughter is 3.5 years old and I have been looking for a large enough sturdy bathtub for her.This one is just perfect in every aspect.It is large and deep enough for a toddler and very comfortable and stylish.My daughter is thrilled with it and loves her bathtime in her new Primo Euro Bath.It is easy enough to empty out the water and it fits perfectly in a standard bathtub.Definately a good buy.I would not reccomend it to parents of a newborn or a small baby.This is more of a second baby bathtub.My 9 month old son loves bath time with the Fisher Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub.over twice as much water as the FP whale tub.He loves bath time with his Fisher Price Whale tub since he was an infant.Always smiles and never wanting to get but yesterday for the first time, I saw him startled and whining to get out of the tub.Never once saw my son slip on the Whale tub.I bought this tub after my 5 month old son started to become too big for his other infant tub.A friend has this tub and highly recommended it.The tub is roomy and the grooves hold him well.We love this tub and highly recommend it!this tub is a little big, but it is absolutely the best tub out there.We bought this tub before our daughter (first child) was born.After 22 months of use, this tub is still in perfect condition and our daughter still fits in it with room to spare.This tub allows you to wash your child with at least one, if not both, hands free.The baby sits in what reminds me of a western-style saddle with the piece in front that won't let baby slip down -- even as a newborn.Our daughter's very first bath was in this tub just the way it's pictured here (no infant insert needed).We expect she'll fit in this tub well past her 2nd birthday.We blew it up tonight thinking maybe we'd start putting her in the adult tub with the duck since she splashes us a lot now and soaks the walls when we use the eurobath on the bathroom counter top.To our dismay, we found that the duck inflatable tub was way too small.We assume other inflatable tubs will be too per their dimensions.In addition, the duck tub was so narrow that our daughter's bath toys would have been piled up on her lap.I can wash her hair and her body without holding onto her or worrying she'll slide and bump her head, etc.She still manages to swish herself around face down, despite the little barrier that sits between the baby's legs.I'm too afraid to try bleach in that spot, since it's where the most sensitive part of her body rests in the tub.If I could have gotten another color for the same price, I would have.I needed a bathtub that would work for both my infant son and my 3.5 year old daughter.I also needed a new infant tub.I really like the size of this tub, because it is huge (though it still fits easily into my standard size tub).It has a nice contoured reclined position on one side to hold my infant son, yet the sitting position on the opposite side provides ample space for my 3.5 year old daughter.This is the best baby bath tub out there.It is large, taking up a good amount of space, but when hung on the wall (there is a hole in the top rim of the tub for this very use) it's simple to take down and set up and then give baby a bath.We've used it in two of the homes we've lived in, and it's worked great in both.I used it on the kitchen counter in our small condo (as we didn't have much space anywhere else) and then I used it on the large bathroom counter in our townhouse.I tried that sponge shape for our first son in the regular bathtub and that really hurt my back (and he didn't like lying down in the water).At first sight it seems HUGE.Have been using this tub for about four months and have NO complaints.Sturdy, easy to clean, easy to store, and my baby loves it!It also matches our blue themed bathroom quite nicely.Also the shipping time was great!Even with the so-called supports the tub has, she still slid all over the place, and I still had to lean over the side of the tub and hold her very carefully!She hated it and so did I, and to this day (18 months later!)It's considerably smaller, has walls that go straight up (versus being slanted, like the Primo) all the way around, and I think it just makes her feel so much more secure and safe!!I was surprised at just how large this tub was when I received it.It is really sturdy.If you are NOT looking for something large, this is not the tub for you :-)If you have a smaller infant (which I always do), I would think adding a sponge insert will help to allow even the smallest baby to fit.We love it!We started using it as soon as my son's cord stump fell off.The reclining position is pretty darn safe, and it gives the baby a lot of support while you wash, which is a Godsend.The only real negative is the size of the Primo - it gets unwieldy when we have to take it out of the tub when company comes over, but otherwise we just leave it in the tub.I look forward to using this for many years!We call this tub "Moby Dick" in our house on account of it's size, but this has been a great tub for my now 16 mo old.He really cannot slip in this tub and has ample room to play and splash.I use the baby side to shampoo his hair.All in all, a great tub!Everyone is right, this is a great tub for your little one.He fits great into the infant side and he had a blast the first time he was in the tub.So worth it.He doesn't find it so amusing anymore but it's great for me because I can give him a bath alone now instead of having to have another person hold him up in the tub.But, no big deal since we use the cup to rinse his hair anyway.Before I gave birth I received a smaller blue infant tub that is generally pretty popular and widely available.I loved it for my newborn, it was small and compact and easy to place over the sink.However by months 3 it was clear the tub was far too small for my son, even though it claimed to be for toddlers as well.So we decided to get this one, it is far superior to the previous one.Though this one does not come with an newborn insert I find the tub itself is so much smoother, softer and more comfortable for the baby then the previous one.The laying down part is still being used at 7.5 months.I think it will probably be used for quite a while, since it is easier to lather him up in that position.I am very happy with it and highly recommend it for your newborn, infant or toddler.Love this tub for my 8 month old.She had outgrown her washpod tub (which she also loved) but I wasn't comfortable putting her in the regular bath tub yet since she is such a squirmer.This tub was a hit right off.She loves it, there is plenty of room for her to splash around and it is really easy ton wash her.We still use this tub for my daughter at 2 1/2, 30 lbs and 37" tall, and have used it since birth.It is so RARE for a "convertible" baby-to-toddler product to actually pan out in real life that I just had to review this.The molded shape of this tub is just perfect, and thinks of everything!The slanted part is such that we still use it to wash my daughter's hair even as a large toddler.It seems to be very comfortable between the crotch as she's never complained, and sits relaxed reclined or upright.As a baby, she was cradled, secure and very happy.I love everything about this tub, especially its' large size.Given this tub's large size, I can (now that she's too big to ever slip under) fill it up to the top, and she's got warm water and suds up to her mid-chest, without any risk of her falling under as with an adult tub.The rubber drain is the only place where we get some mildew, but it pops right out for easy cleaning and reinserts just as easily.Even with a full tub, in 2.5 years we've never had a crack.I love this tub so much, we bought two more - one for Grandma and Grandad's in each state!For $25, this is a slam dunk in all respects.Since we bought these from BabiesRUs He has managed to get one piece off but considering he weighs 25lbs and has been pulling at these constantly I'm only taking 1 star off.Otherwise this is doing a great job keeping him safe and reapplying the one piece isn't that hard.I bought the brown ones and both my wife and I actually think it looks pretty good on our gray brick fireplace and brown tables.We also bought a 4 pack of their edge guards after the first two brands we tried couldn't survive my son's curiousity.This is a great product for anyone living in America or overseas like we are.Our apartment is made with solid concrete and I am able to hear the monitor all the way in the front of the house.The transmitter is downstairs in the baby's room and the parent receiver is upstairs in the kitchen.No, the sound quality is not perfect but it is great for the price.I don't get any static.My only real complaint with this is that it takes a 9V batter (or can be plugged in) but the battery is not rechargeable.But, the one that did work, we really like.We use the baby monitors primarily at night, so that we can hear if the kids wake up in the middle of the night.This always wakes us up.SO JUST SWITCH IT..THAT SIMPLE..I HAVE HAD IT ON FOR LAST FEW DAYS AND WORKS PERFECT..VERY SENSITIVE, AND ALMOST NO HISSING OR BUZZING AT ALL.. AND DOESNT NEED TO BE TURNED UP VERY LOUD..JUST SET IT RIGHT NEXT TO THE CRIB ON A TABLE....VERY HAPPY WITH ITI love it.We bought this because my 2 year old lost the cord to our old monitor.If you are looking for crystal clear & no interference then you will have to spend more than $16.It does have some occasional interference, but you just move it a little or switch the channel & it is fine.It fit our budget & our needs and I have been happy with it.I didn't have high expectations.Well, since then, grandma ended up moving into a 4900 sq ft house, and baby and I lived with her for a month.I used this monitor every night and it never went out of range even in a house that big (at that point my daughter wouldn't sleep without music on, so I knew since I could still clearly hear her lullaby CD that it was working just fine).After that, I moved into my current 2600 sq ft home, and this monitor has performed beautifully.It doesn't pick up any interference even with 2 different wifi networks in the house (linksys and netgear) and it has seriously taken a beating.It has been sat on, dropped on concrete, rained on- and this morning I even dropped it in a puddle while taking photos in my backyard!Since using these nipples my daughter has had considerably less colic.These are also a lot thicker than normal nipples, they are of a higher quality but they only fit avent bottles.I like the avent nipples because they don't deform like the medela ones.I haven't tried many nipples since he seemed to do fine on these.I bought these to put into some "2" nipples I had since I got a set of these avent bottles.My almost 4 month old baby loved this.Sometimes he can take the 3 size but this one is the most comfortable with.Nice and sturdy!Easy to install and use.This gate wont budge when it is installed so it is very safe.It looks nicer then some of the other gates on the market.We still have this years later and got a second one when we moved.My oldest is almost 4 and she still cant open it on her own.Still loving it!It holds on for a while but still she can tear it down.This is a great gate.Very sturdy and easy to open.Easy!!Great when I'm taking groceries in the house and don't have an extra hand to fiddle with one of those tricky gate locks.LOVE IT!!!It doesn't leave "marks" on the trim or "damage" the walls... some reviewers must be over-tightening their gates if they're having that much trouble.Great gate- worth the money!We've had two of these gates for six months and have been almost 100% happy with them.We love how they open and close by pushing on the pedal (ours has worked perfectly, although I see that some had said that theirs breaks) and opening with the knee.Based on our experience and reading many reviews before deciding which gate to buy, it is my sense that for the price, most people are very happy with this gate.You might be able to spend double or triple and get THE PERFECT GATE, but really this one will probably do for about everyone.However, our child tends to be the investigative type and has thus far made no progress learning to open the gate.This seems to be a good, decent popular working gate for most people and needs.The kickstand takes a bit of pressure to release, but it's good to have, because my son can't accidentally push it down and open the gate.The gate area is smaller than an average to walk through, but it's not too bad.Out of all the gates we have had we like the Hands Free gate the best.It says it's not approved for use at the top of the stairs because the only gates approved for use at the top of the stairs are hardware mounted ones, so I just put it in the hallway right before the stairs and works great.Although it's so sturdy, if there wasn't the rule about needing to be hardware mounted it would work for stairs.In order to open the gate you have to have a good amount of leg strength that I wouldn't anticipate younger kids having.We use this gate with one extension and it works perfect for keeping my very large 1 yr old (~30 lbs) out of the kitchen while cooking.Very sturdy and nearly impossible for him to open on his own.No complaints after 3 months of use.She said it was easy to install, she had to do it her self because her hunny was in Iraq.Not their safety so much as my sanity.So this gate seemed like the perfect idea.It's sturdy and attractive, easy enough to open even if your arms are full of toys, laundry, children...  but not so easy my girls were able to figure it out (again, we only had it 9 days though!).which seemed to fill the gap nicely...  until today...  when I went to open the gate, the wood went flying out, the gate slid down, the pressure pad stayed in place...  so the bolt that adjusts the pad bent, and now the whole top of the gate seems cockeyed.Girls still haven't figured out how to open it and boy are they mad.The gate was smarter than me!My son, who is Mr. Motor Skills, cannot open it.Would make an excellent dog gate for small dogs.Sometimes the pedal can get sticky and you have to push on it a little harder, but that's really my only complaint.Instead, I mounted the gate in the doorway of our baby's nursery, and it is working out GREAT.I've been a child care provider and teacher for years.You come to absolutely dread going in and out of inferior baby  gates.Love it.I was happy to find a gate that works for us.Not sure what other options we had for mounting to our round staircase baluster.Overall, I am happy with this purchase.Very pleased with this gate.but in spite of some of the obvious flaws (as mentioned in detail by other reviewers) this stool has actually been perfect for us.It still looks great & will last until the grand-kids at the rate it is holding up.It seems indestructible.Some reviewers complained that it tips if a child steps too close to the edge.There's a trade off here: if you build a perfectly stable stool with a wide base, then another safety scenario is created: the base becomes a tripping hazard.There are hazards in life.Nothing is perfectly safe.It is durable, sturdy and is a companion for my 2 year old.She seems to take it all around the house (even climb up the sofa from the armrest side) just to go up the sofa.It has been very easy to have the young gal adapt to using it.I remembered seeing the Babybjorn step stool at a friend's house and decided to take it for a spin.In my opinion, accidents happen.I've purchased many sippy cups in the past 6 months.Pick up the travel sealing disc accessories and you have a leak proof system for diaper bags.Philips Avent Sealing Discs, BPA-FreeI'm not sure if Avent sells separately the little clear discs that go inside the sippy lid, but that would be great if they did.I tried just about everything to help heal them.(If you do this, wipe off the A+D before breastfeeding/pumping as it can be harmful if ingested by baby.i bought it for my daughter for a night flight & it was good for my piece of mind, but i didn't even use it on the day flight back, because she was moving around so much that it would have just made her mad to be strapped to me..good for the night flight though since she slept so much..but i still didn't sleep at all really...i was not fully awake (caring for a newborn and all) when i ordered these and thought i was ordering extra breast cushions for my pump (which would be nice) so clearly i did not read carefully and was surprised by what i got.However, i am thrilled because i also was looking for something like this (a different name was recommended) and these work great.When nursing i would soak myself and my daughter and pumping was not much better, at least my little girl wouldn't be soaked.:-) using these i typically catch an ounce in them which is worth so much to me.my daughter doesn't seem to notice that she isn't getting soaked, she didn't seem to care before but i sure did.i'm so happy with them that i came back to order an extra set for my emergency pump kit for the car.i do enjoy saying its my best accidental purchase so far :-)-Traci (using shared hubbys account)I have four kinds of baby spoon (sassy, gerber, toss'n'go, and these) and these meal mates spoons are my very favorite.I have been using these spoons for two months, from my baby's age of 6 mo to 8 mo.Pros:The most comfortable spoon in my hand, well-balanced, no sharp edges, not fatiguing like the sassy spoons and gerberA good shape for my baby's mouth, don't lose food on the way inHold just the right amount of food, I like a spoon that isn't too bigBright and cheerful colorsDishwasher safe, I have not observed any staining or bleaching from the dishwasherNice weight, not too lightCons:Yes, carrots do stain them.If you're hand-washing, be aware of this spotNot great for travel because they're heavyAs for the other spoons I have:The plastic toss'n'go spoons are best for traveling because they're light and indestructible.They are nicely proportioned for little mouths.The gerber spoons are fine, but not as comfortable or well-balanced as the meal mates.I really don't like the sassy spoons.A good, simple implement.The colors were very vibrant at first but soon started to absorb the color from carrots and sweet potatoes.Made in China but what is not?These bottles were recommended by a friend.We initially bought the 6 oz size.IMHO spare the hassle and just buy the bigger size since the kid will outgrow the small size within a couple of months.I have used both the brush and the comb on our newborn.The bristles on the brush are so soft, he likes the massage, and it helps rid his head of the cradle cap.The comb is also soft, I certainly wouldnt violently run it through my newborns scalp, but with a gentle stroke it works just fine!These create lots of tiny bubbles that my son swallows when he drinks from this top.I actually bought them to go in my Klean Kanteen sippy top, and of course they're perfect for that.These fit our cups just fine.We seem to be great at losing the inserts!I bought this because it looked so cuddly and snuggly for my baby and because so many people had reviewed it as being helpful for keeping newborn heads where they should be in the carseat.Playtex offers a variety of nipple (slow,medium,fast,variable,&cereal;) flows so it is easy to find a nipple flow that matches your flow :), also a very important factor when switching.They're really easy to clean since they come apart, and the parts are easy to clean.So really, I would recommend looking for the deluxe/premium storage kit.When you're ready for the bottle just warm up some water in the microwave, and then plop the bottle into the water.It keeps air from her tummy and ventilates perfectly.I've been using it since day one after being a nanny for many years and seeing how different bottles act differently.The ventilation system helps keep my baby's acid reflux under control.You don't have to use a bottle brush if you don't need to.The number of parts to clean is comparable to Dr. Brown's bottles, but Dr. Brown's bottles at least provides you with a cleaning brush to clean the interior nipple; with Playtex, you're out of luck.Since then, even when dry, I rarely hear the venting of air.These bottles are horrible, first I got only two of this brand because of an emergency since I've always used Dr. Browns but they got contaminated in the dishwasher, so I had to run and get at least two of this meanwhile cause Dr. Browns wide neck are hard to find at retailers in my area, so we used these two bottles for 2 days first they come with fast flow wich is Waaay to fast for my little guy and I would say any other baby younger than 6 months old, so I decided to get two nipples medium flow, guess what still fast, specially if You have a gassy baby, then in the last try I got the slow flow and guess what again, tooooo slow, It was like a nightmare, I had to use the small 4ozs Dr. Browns I had at home wich my baby is already drinking 5 ozs so...These spoons are the perfect size for first feeders.The bowl of the spoon is narrow and not too deep, so the food actually gets into my son's mouth.These work the best, are cheap and are BPA free and recyclable!We were disappointed with this bottle warmer for our twin boys.The Dr. Browns is much better, and we have found that one works great for Dr. Browns, First Years and Playtex bottles.I just pour the milk into the bottle, plop it in the warmer, and it is heated to the perfect temperature with the touch of a button!It may be my son only but he doesn't care if his bottles are cold or warm and I use water that is in gallon containers which sit on the counter so his bottles are generally at room temperature anyway.Also I have to manipulate the On switch for far too long but I actually get it to turn on.Also you have to wait 10 minutes to try again, if a bottle is not warm enough, you have to use something else anyway!The instructions state that the unit needs 10 minutes to cool down if you need to use it again, but it may actually take longer than that...I would prefer to use hot water than using this warmer.We tried it 3 times, once actually following direction, then twice adding more water to see if it makes any difference.It doesn't work.Pity really, it would have been SO convenient to warm a bottle up as quickly as it says(1 minute, I believe).But we have to continue doing it the old-fashioned way.I was so happy to find this on amazon.com and it was definitely worth it for the price.I am still using Medela 5oz bottles and it fits easily inside.Just be careful the first time you use it; it goes so fast that it could splash up on you if you aren't paying attention and you leave it in there for too long.I used it with my daughter who is 4 and just bought another one for my son.These nipples have helped me to do so.It took my son a couple of tries to understand not to suck too hard because he was getting more but he's a pro now!I bought these because I thought that I was going to start adding cereal to my son's milk, however then realized this was a no no.Nice colors.Also, the fork tips are rounded, so our son has a little trouble spearing things with it.So you have to keep them organized in seperate bags.My son never used these...since he is a boy and the ones I received were pink...so I can't attest to whether he liked them or not.Maybe it's just me, but colors may vary just doesn't fly with baby stuff unless all the colors are neutral.Good quality nipples.I bought them to replace medium-flow Evenflo nipples.I get considerably more leakage around the edges than I did with the Evenflo, others.This would guide the nipple to a perfect position every time, eliminating the problem above.Also, this cap gives you no real grip on the top of the bottle.It really helps to have extra dome caps.If you have to rewash it, or if you simply misplace one, its great to have extra.I bought these as extras in case I lose some as my son gets older.I bought these to use for my klean kanteens that have the sippy adaptor and they fit perfectly.The only drawback is that they are very easy to lose.Sometimes I notice condensation inside so they do have to be cleaned regularly to prevent any mildew/mold from growing there.But overall they work great for the price.We actually had to end up disassembling it and using only the outside part of it without the knob.At first I couldn't visualize how a baby (my first) could find a set of stacking cups interesting and enjoyable.Then he started holding them in his hands and walking around with them as if he had hooves.Then he smiles at his accomplishment.It's rather amazing.He seems to find the cups endlessly fascinating.It's a simple and inexpensive delight.Gary PetersonSince there is no regulation for these things who knows how accurate this is.But the cups are well made and the colors are vibrant.My son loves to tear down the towers, pound the cups on the floor and chase the cat with them.Great for travel as you can do lots with them and they don't take up too much space.My 1 year old loves these "stackers,"  He plays with them each and every day for long periods.They are BPA free and the colors (although not as pictured) are nice and bright.Nice construction/hinge.We sent it back without a fuss from Amazon and decided I wanted to give it one more go because I loooooooooved the look so much.2nd time around:B-E-A-UTIFUL!!!!!!!!!It is simply gorgeous and went so well with our living room decor you wouldn't realize it has toys in it.It's big enough for all the living room toys and my 1 year old son can fit in it so I hope one day he'll enjoy playing IN it too!Was easy for my husband to assemble and was in good shape when it arrived which really surprised us because a lot of packages coming overseas to APO get damaged.Our son closes the lid and climbs on top of it all the time.Now we don't accept this behavior, but the chest is proving to hold up just fine.Saw this bath pad, read the reviews, and had to have it!Now, I absolutely love it!It's the perfect pad for 1 parent to bath their infants!With this pad, it so easy for me or my husband to bath our son with out any assistance from the other.My son, absolutely loves his bath pad.While he has a tendency to pooh on it... it does wash up nicely.My only complaint is that when you wash it, the foam filling does become a little distorted.But it's not a big deal!HIGHLY recommend!I bought this item at a local specialty store and the clerk assured me the item was BPA free.When I got it home and opened it I saw the dreaded #7 recycle code on the white part.I contacted Baby Bjorn to clarify.To guarantee the safety of our plastic products, all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Kitchen and Bathroom products are tested by Specialized Technology Resources (STR), an independent global provider of quality assurance testing.BPA is an industrial chemical that is used to manufacture polycarbonate plastic.Polycarbonate plastic is the plastic that has caused considerable recent controversy because of its use in baby bottlemanufacturing and because it has been proven to leach BPA.More specifically, the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN plate is made of ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) plastic which is certified BPAfree.While both polycarbonate and ABS, along with other plastics, have a recycling designation of "7", there is no knownhealth risk associated with ABS."I decided to keep it and see how it goes, even though I prefer using glass or stainless steel items.I like that this one is NOT made in China, like so many things tend to be.We bought this for an extended trip we were taking.I was not disappointed.It worked great and attached to all different seats (although we had to get creative at times).Very compact and easy to fit into the suitcase.My kids are 2.5 years and 1.25 years respectively, and both enjoy using these Take and Toss cups.Thankfully for us, our kids keep the cups upright and are beyond the cup gnawing phase; these cups are perfect for our family.That said, this cup is probably not the best for beginning cup users or kids who still like to throw cups around, but are great for those who are just trying to learn how to walk around with a drink and may sometimes drop a cup by mistake.I know the thing has the dimensions, and of course it's going to be small if it holds a 2X3 frame.Maybe great for a cramped desk space, other than that it is REALLY nice, and super cute!frame is cute.Note that it can only be used for verticle pictures because the images on the sides are set to be vericle.And this happens even though my little one doesn't poop much and has barely started on solids.I only take this out once it is FULL, and you can't smell it in her nursery at all.I did read several reviews that the biodegratable ones aren't quite as good, so I have only used the original onesAll the brands of pads work fine for me, Johnson's leave fuzzies on my nipples but work fine otherwise.It would be nice to see these in a flexible design but I'm not aware of any.It would be even better if it had a velcro attached to it so that you could attach it to the wall or a door when not in use.First of all I have slept on my back all my life, now that I am 19 weeks I know that isn't a great idea and also it just isn't comfortable anymore.She loves it.But I think I love it more than she does.It is also very comfortable.I can sleep with it in both suggested positions ... what I've been doing is I have the pillow in one position and when I wake up to switch the side I'm sleeping on, I leave the pillow in place and just roll my body rather than flipping the pillow.I couldn't get into a deep sleep at all.With the snoogle, my head rests comfortably on the "C" end and I put the "J" end between my legs.But if I had known how much it was going to help I would have bought it months ago.I loved it for the first night or so, but then found myself getting repeatedly tangled up in it and unable to maintain the adjustments I needed to sleep comfortably (since the entire pillow is connected, when you move one part, the rest wants to move with it).It also made sleeping on my side more comfortable.I highly recommend it.I didn't use it for nursing the baby, but I have a friend who did and they said it was great for that as well.Very pleased to have purchased it.Could of minor issues though...I'd HIGHLY recommend washing first (common sense, but again, didn't realize the cover came off).I'll sew up the tear, but the quality of the cover that comes with the pillow isn't great.it takes up a lot of space in the bed, but that is a minor drawback considering how comfortable this pillow is.It doesn't work well for me when it's in the front.I bought this pillow when I was 3 months pregnant with twins.I then switched sides to where I was hugging it and that is the most comfortable position for me by far.I love the other positions too.I know this pillow will get many more years out of it since I will most likely still use it after my twins are born.I loved using this pillow.But it did make a big difference for me, which justified the cost.I LOVE this pillow.I honestly don't move until I have to get up and go use the bathroom.Then I come back and get comfortable in a different position (facing the snoogle hugging it).But other than that, it's been fantastic.Overall it is a good sleeping companion.I had a hard time moving it when I moved positions.I love this pillow.I love that it's not as wide as a standard pillow or as full as my Boppy, because it is so much more comfortable than any pillow I've used for that purpose.And I have ended up using several of them.In my case, I've been experiencing awful sinus congestion and acid reflux from a relaxed esophageal sphincter.It is so versatile and so comfortable that I have yet to find a bad way to prop/curl/fold it.It's been such a great investment and I have a feeling I'll find even more uses for it after this baby is born.At the cost, it would have been nice if it could last my whole pregnancy.Maybe it would be ideal for a singleton pregnancy, but for multiples not so great.It's a bit scratchy so I'm making another pillow case to go over the current one.For now, it is wonderful!I have tried a few types of nursing pads, and these are the ones I personally prefer.they are thick, absorbent, and heavy duty.They last a lot longer than others that I have tried, and hold their shape in the wash unlike others that bunch and wrinkle up.I highly recommend these!These pads would be great is they weren't so thick and if they were larger.I have a few pairs of nursing pads that seem to be just a couple layers of flannel and they work great.I'm sure there are better washable pads out there.I love these!They're very comfortable and soft, and they work great!LOVE them!If you leak a lot or have oversupply (before solids, especially if you're pumping also), these pads aren't good enough.This is comparable to other washable pads I've used, however.I like the lace--it does help prevent slipping.I use these regularly and find them to do a good job.I bought these a couple weeks ago since my beloved Dr. Brown's washable pads are no longer offered.These seemed like they might be similar in size, comfort, and affordability.After the first wash, the flannel on the inside pilled-up, and the pads puffed-up, making them even more obvious in my bra.Since I don't leak much, I can't give much info on how absorbent they are.Loved these.A friend purchased this for us because she loved the one she had.I have to say it has been a wonderful organizer and space saver.It keeps our diapers, wipes and grooming tools at arms reach and looking nice and organized.A really great item!I had been told that a wipe warmer was a must have.I bought brand new stuff for my baby and didnt want to have this happen.I was reading that some people had used cooking racks and other off the wall things to keep it from touching the wood.I love it too because it is great for small spaces and it keeps things organized.I love that the side pieces come off.If you arent using them or dont need them why have them taking up space.I am an OCD mother and this just helps me to keep things together.Now at 10 months, these are DH's go to diaper for fast diaper changes on a squiggler.The fabric stays inside the waterproof, so there's no adjusting or checking to make sure it's all tucked in, and the easy one step velcro is fast.But at $8/diaper opposed to the BG O at $25/diaper, defintely a fabulous value.Id never order them again.Pros:Decent priceCute patternsAbsorbentEasy to wash & dryCons:Large and bulky on babyThe pros out-weigh the cons for me.Great functionality.They work great!But, I love them!This is my third child, but my first experience with cloth diapering and I really love them.I like the size of this tub and it worked really well for us as a tub.But my son didn't care too much about the quacking noise.We ended up using it anyway but we would just keep losing air and it started becoming unsafe because he'd lean on the side and it was deflated.I don't need a baby tub at all now, but if I did, I think I would use something that is not inflatable.Thankfully, we never paid for this tub and it was a gift.First let me say that this is an adorable tub.The Eurobath is a hands-free tub which means the world when you're trying to wash a slipper little baby.When we blew up the duck tub we were shocked to find that it was way too small for her now.I would say this tub won't get you much past a year old -- or even less if you have a bigger kid.We decided that for now, we'll probably just set it inside the big tub or consider a bath seat.If you're looking for a tub for a baby -- please don't consider this duck tub for an infant.It's adorable and appears well made -- it's just very small.Well, I should've listened to my instincts, because when I got the tub, it seemed HUGE, but I tried it anyway....and my daughter HATED it!I wasn't sure if I'd EVER be able to get her to take a bath, but then I thought that maybe an inflatable tub might be worth a shot, esp if it were somewhat smaller (and would possibly make her feel more supported and secure).Well, when I saw this one, I thought it couldn't be more perfect, because it's cute and would probably help distract her a little bit, especially since it quacks (via an electronic device in the beak)!I also bought her the Crayola floating art desk ($[...]), and she LOVED that!So, between the new ducky tub and her bath crayons, my daughter, who HATED bathtime since she was born, is now happily playing in the bath every night!!I liked that you could switch out the breast cup to accommodate different nipple sizes, and assembly was slightly easier, but it does not have the "massage cushion" which makes it a little less comfortable.Fortunately, you can now buy replacement valves that are inch long pieces of sturdy, flexible plastic.It also takes standard size bottles, including Medela, Even-flo, etc, which is an advantage if you don't already use Avent bottles.So, well, I can see certain advantages to this Lansinoh (cost, bottles), it's not my favorite.Well now that he is bigger we started using the tub again.I am going to purchase the Primo tub since the molding looks much more effective and safe.I had one of these before and loved it.Could have a better drainage system.Okay, I bought this and didn't love it.Then, I bought the Primo bath so my baby doesn't slide around so much....well, she just wasn't comfortable laying in a molded position.Anyways, switched back to this tub.Otherwise, worth the price!And the infant mesh net didn't work well for us....It was not great for our newborn (we used the tub without it).and she loved it.She relaxed in the sling like it was a hammock.This tub makes it a whole lot easier and funThe infant mesh hammock is great for our baby girl.The size is also good.I really like this tub and highly recommend it.I love this tub....the sling is perfect for my newborn daughter....she absolutely loves taking a bath and does not fuss whatsoever.I do not have any other experience with baby tubs other than this one and i love love love it!I loved having this bath for my son's first year of life.He could still use it now (11 months old) but he just likes being in the big tub =)  The sling was absolutely perfect for him because he was born 8 weeks early and had to be given special baths for the first few months of life.It grew with him perfectly and helped him as he was learning to sit in the water and play with the water.I recommend this tub and am so thankful my friend bought it for me!My baby absolutely loves to be bathed in this, she is so comfortable in this and the sling is perfect for the baby.I've had this tub for a little over five months.The sling worked great while my son was an infant and he loves bath time.as a parent I don't have time to disinfect this with clorox and triple rinse every time it's used.This tub is great.He's safe in the net, not touching any hard corners of the plastic tub.He does occasionally slide down, but I can't complain.At least for now, I can't predict how big his splashes will be when he's a toddler.From the first bath until four months later, this bath tub has been amazing!The sling is perfect and adjustable.The drain is perfectly placed to allow the water to leave while we rinse him with fresh water.The only MINOR complaint I would have is with regards to the placement of the head.I have to be very careful not to let the faucet touch the baby.If they had put the place for the head on the other side, the bath tub could not have been more perfect!He loves his bathtime!My only complaint is that the small pad at the toddler end of the tub fell off.We just used some goo gone to remove the remaining glue and he seems to be fine without it.We'll soon be moving it from kitchen sink to tub as he is now learning splashing is fun.We have absolutely no complaints about this tub.It is great!This tub is perfect especially for a first time mother.I was very nervous about bathing my newborn but he snuggled right in without any discomfort.Plastic is sturdy, no toxic plastic smell, no sharp edges.The "hammock" is a great feature for floppy newborns.It allowed our newborn to experience warm water in the tub which he really enjoyed (compared to sponge baths).Once he was less floppy, we put him on the newborn side without the hammock and then transitioned him to the "big boy" side.You will not be able to wash a toddler in this tub.The newborn sling is a great feature... my newborn feels safe and secure and enjoys bath time.Without it... he gets very nervous.. love it.We received one of these and two of the Munchkin (3 compartment dispensers).I was so proud.However, once I bought the right size (27 mm) it was still a godsend, it was my fault and not the company's.And once we decided to stop using it, it only took a few days to completely wean him off the shield with the LC's help!I have a particularly small child.I purchased this item in hopes to get some relief for my sore nipples.I'm sure it probably works for some people but I had a Medela Nipple shield with my first child that covered all of the areola and was a better fit.I had to order this one online since we are military and stationed overseas.I did like that the baby gets more skin to skin contact with this item...so if your child isn't a petite little one...they may like it.However, I realized when I opened it that it wasn't what I need.However, when I used one with him, it was given to me by a lactation consultant, so I knew nothing about what size it was or anything.So, I did some research and discovered that the best size to get for a newborn is usually the extra small one.The standard size would be more appropriate to use in an older child.So, if you are planning to buy these for use with a newborn or young baby, try the small or extra small - do some Google research - or talk to a lactation consultant - to find out more about what size is most appropriate for your baby.I will keep these, because you never know if I'll need them when she is a little older.. maybe when she gets her first tooth or something - I'll be doing skin to skin breastfeeding by then - the shield is just a precaution in case she needs help learning to latch like my son did.. but it's temporary.. so I guess if I end up needing to use a larger one later for any reason, it will be good to have them handy.This item is great for taking on the go--restaurants, playdates, friend's houses...It's large enough to cover a nice size area but still rolls up easily and the material is easy to wipe off and take home to be washed.But it is not dishwasher safe and because of the suction cups, it's like trying to wash an octopus in the kitchen sink.I OWN ONE AND USE IT ALL THE TIME.MY TODDLER LIKES TO PUT ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN HIS MOUTH AS ANY ONE WOULD AND THIS PLACEMAT HELPS MAKE SURE HE ONLY EATS WHAT IS CLEAN AND HAS LESS BACTERIA.IT IS ALSO DURABLE, FLEXIBLE AND EASY TO CLEAN AND ONCE DONE, JUST ROLL IT AND PUT IT AWAY.AMAZING.This placemat has been a great purchase!I purchased it for use when we take our 9 month old out and it has been well received!Not only does it cover the table, it catches some of the food items my son drops.This is quite handy and an unexpected benefit.Love it and so does my son.The avocado was still a little lumpy for me, so I just ran into through the mill again and that helped get out a lot of the tiny chunks.For making simple baby food, this product fits the bill.I purchased this food mill to make food for my five month old baby girl.I will say that it does work very well for SOME foods but not all.As you can expect, it works great with soft foods such as banana and avocado.It does work with other things such as peas, broccoli, and pears but I found that it still left the food grainy and not smooth enough for my baby who is still eating stage one foods.I did like that it separated the stings from the sweet potatoes which helped a lot.Maybe I will use it more once my baby starts stage 2 foods.Works great.We used it horizontally, unlike the suggested vertical method.Our son (now 23 months) has not put great effort in trying to defeat the lock, but I think it would be physically very difficult for a child his age to do so.It is easy to install and does make the seat sit funny like some others do.It does its job.I bought this set as I hoped it had a little bit of everything in case he gets bored of one particular item we just switch to another.I really like the variety in this box.Before handing any of these to my son, I made sure I washed them in warm water with mild "kid safe" soap.Beware the camera on this package has a battery which I mistakenly soaked in water.My baby is enjoying the vivid colors and interesting sounds this set has to offer.They are cute, semi-soft and perfect size for little hands.They also make a nice sound while propelling themselves!I'd expect something closer to $20, $25 max, rather than $30 or $35.The size is perfect (not tiny, like a matchbox car) they're big, but not too big.Or they could just roll them forward, at their own speed.Highly recommended - lots of fun!I like that they are soft and easy to clean too - just give them a good wipe.There are several different Leachco Cuddle-U Nursing pillows available and they are not all created equal.We purchased this Leachco Cuddle-U - Pillow for and our granddaughter and she just loves it.Other than that, it's absolutely great.She is now 6.5 months and still loves to watch the world while propped up on this pillow.The u-shape helps keep her up comfortably and holds her in if she tries to roll over.No problems.However, I was soon dissapointed... of course, only after I bought more of this brand.After 2-3 weeks the numbers came off the bottles so you had to eye the measurements.My son is still at 6 oz, but if he ever gets 8 oz I don't know how I'm going to easily fill these bottles as the 8 oz line is very close to the nipple despite the 9 oz bottle measurement.The bottles WILL randomly leak.I bought this for my 8 month old, because at night he kept taking off his blanket and he would get cold and wake up.The first night that he used his Sleepsack, he slept through the night and woke up very happy!They are well-made, cozy, comfortable, and the boys seem to like them.No complaints here!So happy I use these for my baby, secure, easy, practical, simple, I love these, I'll be getting more soon : )you can't go wrong with these.My daughter started teething at 3 months and we had great difficulty finding a teether that she liked.She loves grabbing the blankie and chewing on the ends.These pads make already sensitive nipples itch like crazy!The Lansinoh pads are the best, no question.Also, it doesn't grind the food very well AT ALL.The good: It works well and does exactly what I bought it for: pureeing food from the table at home and while traveling so I don't have to deal with jarred food.I've used it successfully on peas, all kinds of fruit, pasta, rice, cooked carrots and brussels sprouts.i should have bought ended up buying an electric food processor.I don't know if it works.I used a hand blender all the time when I had to puree food.When she was old enough to eat regular food, she didn't want pureed food any more.i received this as a gift from my mother.I have yet to be able to successfully turn the handle and press at the same time in any effective fashion.You also have to get messy to get the grate disk off, the only way to do it is to press down on the dirty grate with your thumbs and work it off.I put a watermelon chunk in there, and now it's permanently stained orange.It purees soft foods like bananas or apricots very well but carrots and broccoli came out very grainy, baby refused to eat it.Great for home or travel.No more lugging around premade, store bought baby food in breakable, glass jars!You can feed your baby practically what ever you're having and grind it up fine enough for their precious little mouths to chew and swallow without the fear of them choking on something cut too big.Would even work for those who are older and need their food pureed.I bought this stool to use while giving my infant a bath.I use this everyday at bath time.Apparantly not all snugrides are considered equal when it comes to the base.I purchased this model thinking I would save money on my spare base.I LIVE IN A SMALL TOWN AND WE HAD A 3 HOUR RIDE HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL.IT'S NOT LIKE THIS IS A RETURNABLE ITEM.I DIDN'T AND I REGRET IT.I ENDED UP THROWING THIS PUMP AWAY AND I CRINGED WHEN I DID IT, IT FELT SO WASTEFUL!I purchased this to give my husband for his first Father's Day & he absolutely loved it!This item is fairly large, it will surely cover the seating area where the car seat goes, and a bit more also.I own an Chevrolet Equinox SUV, so I have medium sized space in the back seating area, so for me is not that troublesome.It has a gray synthetic mesh underneath to help it adhere to the surface to prevent slippage.I read complaints about this gray material staining the surface underneath...I have not had that experience after a month of use, but were already on cooler climate, so that might explain it since these accidents are related to hot weather.We bought this at a different retailer and used it with our first baby's carseat.I think because of the thickness of the pad, it doesn't conform to the shape of the seat, but becomes an additional surface, which can lead to a carseat sliding too much.We ended up getting something else, much cheaper, for the back of the seat, rather than something underneath the carseat, and that worked great.I think using a towel could work fine, underneath the carseat, for some protection, without sliding issues.This mat is perfect.In fact I bought two one for my 4 years old booster and one for my sons infant carseat.this is a great seat saver.When I was pregnant with my first son, I bought one of these for his nursery.He prefers the ocean sounds with buouy.I didn't purchase this item right when my DD was born because I figured it wasn't a necessary item.A light went off and I realized that all she needed was some background noise because the absolute silence was unnerving for her.The volume is great and has a great range from quiet to loud.We use ours on the continual on position but you can also put it to go off in 60minutes.Volume is great going from quiet to loud.2.It doesn't interfere with us hearing our DD on the baby monitor.3.Choice of continual play or turning off after 60min.5.It sounds like continual static.It's weird though because I will turn it off and on and it goes down again even without touching the volume keys.It was all over the map thermomoter wise.holy goodness.piece of mind.it's worth the 50!!Yeah, I'm sorry I spent the 12 originally and tried to cheap out because this caused way to much worry.I loved the colors and patterns, it's what attracted me to this bedding set.Very good quality even after 4 years!I returned it for a medium and the medium is still HUGE.I also would prefer it to have sleeves.I am a huge fan of the Carter's sleepers.They are PERFECT and have sleeves.BUT, they come in ONE size: 0-9 months.I want to be able to put my baby in a sleep sack, but the fleece are becoming much too warm for this time of year.My son loves a sleepsack, but some of them are so heavy.I'm a big fan.This particular one is very light weight so has been great for the warm summer.This wipe warmer does an awesome job keeping wet wipes warm and moist.It does not work with huggies but does work with all Pampers wipes.The wipes aren't super warm but not cold either by the time they reach little man.I'm using this warmer with Pampers wipes and the combination is just awesome.It comes with a pillow that you soak in water and place at the bottom of the wipes to keep them moist; after 3 weeks of use and only soaking it the first time it has worked perfectly and every wipe has been moist; no need to resoak thus far.I have not seen any wipes turn brown due to the heat; every one of them has come out normal color, moist and fresh.The best part is seeing how my baby boy doesn't even notices when the wipe touches his skin because it is warm and cozy!Way different than using a cold wipe where he flinched immediately and started moving and protesting.He spits up often during changes, and his diaper isn't quite strong enough for him sometimes, so having warm wipes to take care of these little messes is wonderful!You can always hold the wipe for a while to warm it up, but when you need a warm wipe NOW, this does the job.For those middle-of-the-night changes it's great, cold wipes aren't good on a sleepy bottom.We love it!FYI- you need to make sure the pad stays wet and dispose of the wipes touching the pad as they tend to smell rank.Also, the wipes aren't that warm, but they aren't room temperature.I make my own wipes using hot water and medical non-sterile gauze sponge so I have to open the lid to access the wipes.My wipes are kept warm but do get dried out and brown sometimes if I don't use them fast enough.It will get kinda reddish in color but I wash it and reuse it anyway.Very nice.Our son loves his letters and numbers and this set has gotten tons of use.The size of the set is nice because anymore and it would overfill our little tub bag.The first time we used these we tried to spell out our sons name only to realize there is only 1 of each letter.They stick to the tub well and the bright colors are great for our son.Its very easy for him to hold and use, but doesn't leak.Its also very easy for us to disassemble, wash and reassemble.BUT I have one complaint: You can't choose the color, and the PINK is VERY PINK.I just don't feel right giving them to my son, at least not in public.I purchased 3 different guards at once and I sent them all back!!I bought these because they were one of the cheaper versions.These are so soft and curve slightly to form a cup.I have tried many pads before settling on these.These nursing pads are amazing, they're the only ones I've found that are pre-coated with lanolin nipple cream, are very comfortable, don't slide around, and don't show under clothing.No complaints.The preemie nipples let the perfect amount of milk out so that he wasn't overwhelmed.I love Dr. Brown's.My baby girl was full-term.I paid extra for next day delivery and so glad I did...worth it!:)  (BTW, I first tried "Playtex Vent-Aire", as recommended by my lactation consultant, and it wasn't noticeably slower to me.)These nipples are perfect for breastfed babies taking their first bottles because the flow is slower than most Level 1 nipples.Highly recommended!This is THE ONLY toy my son was interested in before he was about 3 months old.He has loved it since he was about a month old and is still loving it at 7 months.From twisting and turning it to using it as a teether, it's always a hit.I would disagree with a previous post that it is hard to grip, it has always been easy for him to grip- that's one of the things we loved about it.I bought this from Babies "R'' Us when my son started putting everything in his mouth.It also rattles and can be bent in a number of different ways.The teether is easy for my son to grasp and twist.The teether is very easy to clean, just hand wash and air dry.It is small enough to throw in the diaper bag and entertaining enough to occupy my son during car rides, doctor's office visits, etc.I bought this teether for my 5 month old twins.Its fun to bend and twist into different shapes, but overall its pretty useless.For babies age 4-6 mo.I would purchase something smaller in size for tiny hands and mouths.When my son or I did this, the hoop came off the bathtub wall.I specifically had a problem with the left suction cup not staying attached.The right suction cup worked fine, so the hoop was always falling sideways.I had a serious issue with mold collecting in the balls...and at bathtime, if you squeezed the balls, a ton of mold flakes come out.Unless I cleaned them out before bath time, I really didn't want them in the tub.I'd suggest going with another brand.The co-sleeper will bow in the middle, and our baby rolls towards one end of the co-sleeper, much to our chagrin!My husband stacked a few towels underneath to not only fix the 'bow' in the middle, but to slightly raise one end of the co-sleeper mattress so our baby's head was slightly elevated while we slept.This co-sleeper does not allow you to tuck anything into it's 'mattress', but we got around that by using a Miracle Blanket to swaddle our baby with.I bought this box a bit under 2 years ago... ended up buying a second one because I liked it so much!These are not safe for any child as they are made post manufacturing of your car seat, and therefore have not been safety tested with your car seat.The original is perfect for winters in the midwest.The 'LITE' version is great for our springtime also.Will continue to purchase for new mothers because everyone loves them.I bought this for my twin boys who are now 6 months.My son loved to look at this mobile.You can change the pictures from time to time.The pictures face down towards the baby, which is nice.We were very pleased.I bought this for our 3 month old, and the concept is obviously great-- lots of stimulating patterns and contrasting colors.I just did not feel comfortable leaving her alone in her crib for even 30 seconds, while that was over it.I think I'll return it and get something soft with less small parts.My son didn't really enjoy or even notice the mobile till about 2 mo.I think if I had a mobile in his crib that played music or moved he might have enjoyed it sooner.When my baby was 5 weeks I printed off some stimulation images from the internet and taped them to the bottom of the shelf over his changing area.He LOVED (and still does at 3mos) looking at them.Once he started smiling and cooing at them, I decided I needed something similar for his co-sleeper.This mobile by Manhattan fits the bill perfectly.I don't miss having a music box or motorized movement.I bought this on a recommendation from my aunt.My daughter loves it and finds it fascinating to look at.The one from Amazon had less pieces, so she got a bit bored with it when I ran out of pictures.Also it doesn't spin like most mobiles and she loves for it to spin.Had to buy a separate motor.It is so awesome seeing her have so much fun with this.I love how you can change the cards because it keeps her interested, even though I haven't had to change them out much.Yes, the product could be made better and you have to be gentle when switching out the cards, but for the price, it is absolutely 5 stars.Another thing I really love is that I can use it with my co-sleeper with an added cost.With the clamp, this STIMulating mobile is one of the best purchases I've made for my baby.Also, while the actual mobile things are beautiful and bright and great for educational development, they are hard to put together and take apart without twisting off the thing that connects them.Regardless, my daughter loves to look at it, especially when the fan blows it so it moves.I wasn't sure about this mobile at first since it doesn't move and it's just a bunch of abstract and simple pictures dangling above the baby, but I needed something to distract my 2 month old daughter at the changing table without having to buy another fancy mobile.At first glance, my baby took to it right away.I don't know why these images attract babies but it does.She loves talking to it...so much so that sometimes I'm reluctant to move her out of the changing table.The stem is made of plastic that comes in two parts which you snap together and once attached you cannot take it apart.Some of the cards have images like a car, house, cat, and dog, but most have abstract images that comes in bold colors or black and white.Taking the cards apart from each other can be tricky and I can see why some people can accidentally rip it apart.So the parts are not exactly sturdy and once my baby can reach it, I'll remove it and just use the cards as flash cards.The mobile comes with several sets of cards so you can change the images and the baby won't be bored.However, I just put the images I like on the mobile and use the rest as flash cards when traveling to distract my little girl.For the price and the entertainment it has brought to my baby, I highly recommend this mobile.It is simple- no music or movement- but he never seemed to mind (it held his attention as much as the mobile on his swing which does make noise and rotates).She says he also loves it.We have been using the black and white cards on this mobile and they easily capture my baby's attention, starting at around 7 weeks old.She is now 11 weeks and she is obviously entertained by it, with big smiles when it is moving.It places some cards in a horizontal position so that they can be viewed from below (perfect for the baby's perspective).The triangle is small and needs some force to push the knob through.We had another mobile from Tiny Love which played music, was very colorful and moved in multiple directions and my son was indifferent to it.But overall I think we got our money's worth many times over with this item.My son adores his mobile.Honestly, it is very simple and I am amazed that he likes it so much.I would not have purchased it unless a friend had recommended it so highly.The simple shapes and colors are apparently very appealing and engaging, judging from how much my son loves to chat it up.Okay, yes, this mobile is not made out of the most durable materials (as other reviewers have noted).We bought this when our baby was less than one month of age and put it over his bassinet.At about two months, he started to coo to the cards when he wakes up and is looking at them as well as when we give them a whirl, and at three months he smiles when we give the cards a whirl.Pros:- Has black and white and color cards, so can be used for different stages.We use it as a means to interact with ours.The plastic on the clamps made me a bit nervous (P&T  has a small, simple solid metal clamp.)Still I saved $60 by ordering these and they work great.This won't work on most tables that have a skirt or that expand as the skirt and the slide rails for expansion get in the way.This seat has made bathing my 5 month old so much more enjoyable.This seat is easy to slide on the side of any standard tub and suctions itself to it so that it doesn't slide around.The only minor flaw I see it that it makes it a little difficult to wash his "privite areas" so I leave them for last and just take him out of the seat to do it; it's not enough for me to take away any points for this otherwise wonderful seat.*WARNING: I did almost lock myself inside his room once the first day I installed it.I had the gate handle in open position and swung out.My son can climb up to stand but cannot climb over it because no rails and he's not tall enough.It took me a little while to align the gait on both sides of the wall so i could screw it in.My 2 year old husky cannot even break it down.Works well to keep my crawling baby from going down the stairs.This is an excellent gate.The hardware mounting option is easy, but the instructions are a little difficult to follow.It boils down to this: You need to extend the gate to the correct length by popping the tabs the lock its position into place.She has chunky legs (30 lbs), so I wasn't sure how well she'd fit in this seat.Turns out it was a perfect fit for her and she has plenty of room to grow.It has held up very well, which is why I knew this would be a great purchase.I love the back rest and the tray with cover is an awesome feature.This is a PERFECT ALTERNATIVE!!!Just started feeding my baby solids.So I tried it and it is GREAT!!!You can also carry his booster anywhere around the house.Baby is not that big yet and can't flip it.We find this very useful when we are traveling or visiting family that doesn't have children.Easy to clean which is a huge help when you are at someone elses home or restaurant.Bought it hoping my son would like it.Haven't used it out to eat yet.My son is 2 years old & we've been using this seat for over a year now.I originally purchased it for use while visiting family & eating out.I also like that it straps securely to the chair, has adjustable height & tray settings & wipes down easily.My son has always been big for his age, so I was concerned that his belly wouldn't fit with the tray on, but it was fine on the middle tray setting.Even being used everyday, it's held up great & still comes clean easily.Now at 30 lbs, he still fits in it with plenty of room to spare.So far, we have not taken it out with us to restaurants but I think we'll be doing that very soon as it was very easy to attach to our chair and adjust for a nice and tight fit.The seat has a little formed bump area that fits between the baby's legs to also help keep them in place, in addition to the 3-point belt.I highly recommend this little booster.To our surprise, he did great!Now, he's almost 6 months old and he's eating solid foods a few times a week.This chair is PERFECT.The tray does fit great into the dishwasher.Our daughter would always bend over and suck on the table when she was in restaurant high chairs and the only place to put her food was on the table where we worried about cleanliness but this booster seat turns any chair into a highchair and every surface they're touching is their own!Not only from a hygiene standpoint, this chair is super easy to attach and even easier to clean!Better yet, the seat has no crevices for the food to get stuck in.The straps are removable for cleaning.I have yet to take it with us somewhere, but I am very impressed that it folds so compactly.Overall I'm very pleased with this booster and wish that I had just purchased it in the first place, instead of a rolling high chair three times the price!We purchased this booster seat based on a recommendation from our friend.I love how everything connects so easily for storage.It works like a charm.My son is comfortable in it.Would highly recommend this to anyone.easy to take to restaurants, babysitters', grandmas', picnics, etc.I've started giving this at baby showers because it is THAT awesome & useful.PS I've seen it at target & walmart in a nice cream/tan/maroon color scheme this year.This booster is perfect - just like everyone else seems to think.wipes up easily on the sides where her food-dirtied hands touch, and the other peices clip right off and fit into our dish washer - easy breezy!love this and highly recommend.I absolutely love this one!!!Of all the baby gear that I have bought, this is by far the one item that I am most satisfied with.When we go out to eat we bring it with us because it is so light, easy to carry (back strap acts as shoulder strap), easy to attach to chairs (we have yet to find a chair that it doesn't work on).Love it.Two years later: still love it.Have never seen any other highchair/booster that I wish I owned instead (or in addition too, for that matter).I'm happy, baby's happy.Fits in seat, is great to be so easily portable from kitchen to dining room.It safely attaches to every chair we've come into contact with.And as noted above we've attached it to things the manufacturer surely wouldn't reccomend, so a watchful parent is a must!But it always was secure, straps are adjustable and easy to use.I read many reviews before purchasing this booster seat, and they did not lie.I've had this seat for a few months now and LOVE it!!!It takes up so little space, and is soooo easy to clean!LOVE LOVE LOVE it!!I love it!There isn't much we don't love about this booster seat.Very light to carry and we love the cover for the tray so if it's messy we don't have to get it sparkling clean before packing up and tossing it back in the car for the ride home.We had the older version from our first child who is 5 years old but never use it because we love all the improvements with this model.We don't care what color they come in but I can see some people wanting "boy/girl" specific colors.I just received this booster seat the other day and I like it very much.Today I was babysitting my 16 month old grandson, and in addition to it being a nice highchair/booster seat, it was also a big hit as a safe little seat to set on my living room floor wherein he could just sit (whenever he chose to do so) and watch Veggie Tales (his favorite).Since there are many young children and babies in our family (who are frequently here) it is nice to have this as a backup in addition to our full-sized high chair.Very sturdy yet easy to fold up to be very compact when not in use.Not sure if it's a defect with our seat or if others have experienced this too.Neither are great options, so beware to taller parents!Besides these two issues, we find this seat a good value.It keeps the baby safe and secure, seems comfortable for the baby, is very easy to wipe down, is easily transportable to use at Grandma's house or at restaurants, and comes with dishwasher-safe divider tray with a cover.No one is aware it's there until we pull the chair out.I needed a booster for my 2 year old and at first wasn't sure if this would be too small, but it turned out to be perfect!I love how it extends three heights, so it can still grow with him.(he is 27 lbs and 33 inches and he fits great, although he is a little small for his age according to "averages" I think there is def.PERFECT item!This has been a fantastic purchase for us.We've been using it for several months now and it's been great.Our son is currently 11 months, and we choose to use this over the booster seat since it's much more sanitary and he wiggles around a lot less.I can't see a need to use any other booster seat.I have used many highchair/booster seats and I have to say that this is one of the best.I love that it can fold down and travel.I will be taking it to Pennsylvania with me from Alaska in a few months in one of our suitcases.I have taken it on road trips and it is so nice.This seat is fantastic for people who have a small dining area and already trip over two decent-sized dogs.Overall, we're very pleased.Gender-neutral color, cleans easily (the tray cover AND removeable inserts are awesome.)Very affordable, and appears sturdy enough to last through several kids.We were happy using this instead.I love that every bit of it is easy to clean (the only non-plastic part is the buckle straps, which yes those get messy too sometimes).And I love that the white tray is removable and dish washer safe.I wish it had multiple white trays to switch out while the other is in the wash, but oh well.We tried this one and it was easy, so we ended up getting this seat instead and I'm glad we did.Its portable making it easy to take along when visiting friends without kids and can be attached on any dining chair (no fold-able chairs as highlighted by another reviewer).Space saver and portable its also colorful and very easy to clean.Love em!We got these for our twins (now 3 years old) and we LOVE them.The boys had to have cereal in their formula and they couldn't get it out of the fast flow nipples.I found that they work Great for a little cereal and when we got to the point that we were giving them more cereal in their formula (we called it formula shakes) I cut 1 tip of the the Y part and it was perfect.Do what works for you.These were perfect for us.The nipples collasped easily and baby got really frustrated.I love the wide nipples.My son never suffered from nipple confusion.I think my 4mo old is too young for it.Otherwise, it's a sturdy design for the price and works well if you want to sleep next to your little one without fear.I purchased the white version of these in December 2009 to use instead of wash cloths on my infant.These are great sized squares to use for wipes.Other than that, these do well in my cloth wipe rotation.I cloth diaper and try to use as many cloth wipes as possible.They are just flannel squares, but they have really helped in my cloth diapering/wiping adventure.The long piece in the package fit perfectly on the short sides when cut in half.I ended up getting a fabric crib rail guard and its been working out much better.I wish I had known it was only one strip and not the whole crib.I paid a lot for our crib and it's one that will turn into a full size bed some day so I didn't want to risk ruining it.Plus, it's HUGE.Unless you want it to overhang the edge of the crib a lot, you should go with the regular sized one.We used this extensively when our daughter first started solids but didn't have the ability to grasp small pieces to feed herself.It was nice to allow her to feed herself and try new things without constantly picking up little pieces of food from the floor or worrying about her choking.Only downsides- we didn't use it for very long- probably only 2 months, so the extra mesh bags I purchased were never used.Also, I don't think the little water reservoir they claim can be refrigerated to keep items cold actually does anything.Bottom line- very useful for that brief period after starting solids and before a pincer grip.Some people complain about that, but what do you expect?Just got my Sassy Teething Feeder today and tried it out.Aesthetically it's so colorful and pretty.The netting is all natural and is not dyed in any color so I don't have to worry about her ingesting anything harmful.It was very easy to put the fruit in and screw on the net on to the ring.Also, there is a push lock on the ring so the baby can't accidentally unscrew it and get the food out.I left my baby with the feeder and a piece of banana and she was happily gnawing for 20 minutes!I bought this to warm bottles that were currently being kept cool with ice packs.However, I switched my approach so now, if I know I'll be giving the bottle in an hour or less, I'll heat the bottle at home and put the already warm bottle in this bottle warmer to KEEP the bottle warm.I do the same thing to keep baby food warm.I imagine that if the bottle started out room temp, it might get fairly warm.And if the bottle or food starts out warm, this will keep it warm.I thought I was buying a different "L shaped" TV guard, not some tiny rectangle of plexiglass.So it works fine if the cup is really full.If anything less than 50% full, baby needs to tilt his head waaaaaay back, or else he will just suck air.Nope, it's ONE SHIELD assembly.These are in some ways easier than the assembly that comes with most Medela pumps -- instead of a separate breast shield and connector, this is just one piece that then connects to a standard valve and membrane.But if you're careful, they're perfectly cleanable.Then when you wash them later, you're not fighting dried milk.Also note that the tubing connects near the top of the back of this assembly, whereas it connects near the bottom of the standard "usual" connector -- this might impact you if you are, say, used to typing while pumping and you might wedge the connectors against the front of your desk to keep them positioned while your hands are typing!Definitely keep a spare set of these with your pump...It is well worth the cost to keep some spares on-hand.The bottom line is that it is sturdy, allows my son to sleep right next to me safely, seems durable, and is attractive.The pockets are great.My son still sleeps in it at seven months old, though our co-sleeper days are numbered due to his steadily increasing mobility.My son has torticollis and it's best if he can sleep with his head tilted a certain way, and this allows me to check his position whenever I happen to wake up during the night.And it is just wonderful to fall asleep while watching my sleeping baby, and so much fun to wake up next to each other.Probably not.As for the pack 'n' play function, it's a sturdy and solid pack 'n' play.Assembly and disassembly really is tricky, though, so much so that we left this at home when travelling recently.I actually have our Graco pack 'n' play bottom with a quilted sheet on top of the Arm's Reach mattress, adding a little softness (though the Arm's Reach mattress is OK) and bringing my baby a little higher and closer to me.Also, I debated whether to buy the Mini Co-sleeper when I bought this, and I'm glad I went with the full-sized version.I definitely would not have felt good about having my son in the Mini for more than a few months.We are on a budget and have made extremely careful choices, so I would never have purchased this if I had known how little it would help us during the newborn stage.I don't think this is a very good value -- our Ikea crib is rock-solid, highly rated by Consumer Reports and Baby Bargains, will last until my son is a toddler, and cost 2/3 of this co-sleeper.On the other hand, it's hard to put into words how wonderful it is to have my son nearby, now that he's willing to sleep there.If you have room in your budget, it is really wonderful to have.My son still sleeps tightly swaddled; otherwise we would have had to have moved him out of the co-sleeper earlier.I am pleased that we were able to use the co-sleeper for this long, and pleased that it still looks almost brand-new.Nice!I absolutely love the cosleeper.We have used it for our daughter since she was a newborn, and it is still going strong at 16 months.The bassinet feature was so wonderful to have;I didn't have to bend over to the floor after giving birth to pick her up.If we hadn't received a crib as a gift, I think it would be a decent option as one.We have a top rated travel crib we love, but it is smaller, not sturdy, and I would not consider using it as a full-time crib.The sheets are the same size as the Pack N' Play, so you can use them if you have both.The co-sleeper is great because you can keep the baby very close at night without having to worry about rolling over on the baby.If the baby fusses or gets hungry, you can just reach over to pat him or pull him into your own bed to nurse.I love this!My daughter is now a little over 6 months and for 2 nights she has been in her big girl crib in her nursery...and I'm so sad about it.Not only has it helped with my first time parent anxiety about 'is she breathing', 'is she on her back', 'is she too hot/too cool' by her being right beside us at night, but it has been a super travel crib for us!We don't trust hotel cribs and when visiting family or friends who don't have cribs or playards, this has been perfect!So we can still use it during travels for a few more months, until she can pull herself up.So, I highly recommend if you are between this and the mini, to get this one if you want it to last a while.Now, we'll have it set up as a playard in the living room to carry outside in the backyard for summer-time fun!The closeness and ease of having your baby right next to you with out having them get used to sleeping with you.True enough it was exactly what I wanted.It was amazing seeing him right next to me all night.It was the perfect height for my bed.When I pushed it away from my bed the wall was easy to put back up to make the fourth wall.I ran into all my trouble when we went to move it into his own bedroom.For the life of me I could not break it down to get it through the darn house.The instructions are on it and I understand how to do it, but executing that procedure frustrates me to no end.I had to get his father to do it.The fabric piece that makes it a bed is attached to one side in a way that forces you to once break the thing down.It swung as much as a rocking bassinet.This review is strictly about the assembly and sturdiness of the item.It is also very sturdy, we are pleased so far.I think this bassinet works for some people, but not for all.This pad helps the carseat stay in place/not slide on the leather seats.It also protects my seat from the inevitable crumbs that fall so they are not rubbing on my seats.Easy to install.I do not use the toy pocket--they are small and hard to get something in/out of--but not needed either, so I didn't mark my score down.I have this for under my booster seat that the 7 year old sits in.It gets the job done.So far, they have worked at all the ranges I needed them to without an immense amount of static.Added Note: I bought this when my son was first born, it has seen a long road since then.He is 3 1/2 y/o and it is still in top condition having survived moving and being slightly abused.It isn't very sensitive to touch I guess.I think my daughter (5 months) will love this more as she gets old.When I opened the package my first thought was - this thing can't be safe for babies.The lining and foam pad seem to be cheaply made.The lining was too loose around the sides of the basket for my taste, and the foam pad was not a snug fit into the basket either, creating the risk of the baby getting their face stuck between the pad and the side of the basket.There was probably a one-inch space between the pad and the sides of the basket.I put my baby in it to test it out and she immidiately rolled to one side where her face ended up against the side of the basket (obviously at 6 weeks, she is not capable of rolling over herself, must be something about the level/grade of the basket that makes them roll).I would not feel comfortable leaving my baby in here unattended for fear she would roll into the space on the sides or up against the side and not be able to breathe.It also didn't look that comfortable anyway and the overall appearance of the basket was not appealing.I ended up getting a Nap Nanny and absolutely love it.This basket is made well enough - not exceptional, but fine.Doesn't take up very much room in our tiny bedroom.It seems very sturdy still after 3 moths of everyday use.My baby loves it.It's hard to beat this adorable top.Lots of sensory stimulation in a safe and easy-to-push top for your little one.The butterfly and flower motif is visually engaging.Great play value.i got this playyard for my 7m old daughter who kept wanting to get into dog food and wires and such so i was constantly running after her trying to protect her from her own curiosity.im also taking college classes online this semester and i cant concentrate with her getting into everything.well, this was a great investment.it seems heavy enough so she can use it when she starts pulling herself up [which shes learning to do] and it wont flip over on her.over all, its great.really.it also is pretty roomy by itself for just her, but i bought the extension because [as mentioned above] i sit in there with her to play with her and, sometimes, to keep her calm while i study.if it helps a mom out in deciding if she can fit, too, im 5-7, 170.***note: i also feel this would be great for puppies, too!with the extension, i think itd be great for puppies to move around at 8wks and have mama dog there to nurse them.Love it.This has kept her contained and safe.She doesn't always like being in it alone but I can put her in it and know she's safe.I decided never to do it again because it was so hard.In a nut shell - If you have a bigger house, this is perfect!)My main gripe is that it's difficult to open and close.to the next position.Very sturdy.Good quality.It is easy to set up and with the extension creates a large area.Great job, Amazon!my son loves being outside and this is perfect for when im trying to do the laundryThis identical to some of the pet pens found in pet stores yet costs a lot less.It's a great size for our mini dachshund.There's plenty of room for a bed, food, water, and a 21"x21" puppy pad.If you get 3' of the standard 12' wide role you can cut it in half and have 2, 3'x6' rectangles (cost me $15 at Lowes) - fits perfectly under the pen when shaped like a rectangle and protects your floor from water, pee, etc.I've also pinched my fingers a few times in the process.It was already assembled, pretty sturdy and is expandable.I got this extention with my playyard because i didnt feel the playyard itself would be big enough for my daughter to crawl freely around and really explore anymore than her pack n play did.VERY nice!We have only had this a year and paid $176 for it.Every time we would go into check on her, our squeaky upstairs floors would wake her up, or if she was just being quiet, it would distract her for us to walk in.Now we use it just when she is stirring around to be sure that she is just moving around rather than being upset.The image is very clear.That makes me even more happy with going with their brand.The only drawback I've found is the level of interference.This soap leaves Baby's skin smooth and smelling great.This was recommended by our pediatrician, and it has lived to our high expectations.This product works so well on my baby/toddler's sensitive skin.We love these!My daughter had some infant acne and being so young we couldn't use anything on it.Also nice for on the go and gentle enough to use on "eye-boogers."We have a climate controlled home.No rough treatment.They split along the grain lines.1.The picture is out of date.If you look at the spindles you will see two sizes used.The larger ones such as the front center one in the picture get screws.The color varies gold-ish tones.They do not even use stainless or brass screws!The box does not say" I asked them to send the marker so I could determine if it was safe and would work or if I was going to return the bassinet.She apologized that they could not send the maker as it was not safe, but if I could not accept the appearance "I guess we could process the return for you".She did mention that I was the only customer to complain about the screws.I asked why they could not use stainless steel or brass screws that could compliment the color.She answered that they are gold color screws.This is almost true.This is not a finish it is the varied color tone from the composition of the metal combined with the manufacturing process.(cheap non-rust prone bolts)I recommended powder-coated screw as powder-coating is safe and used on some baby strollers.Rubbed off easly withGoo Gone - 8 Ounce.- The hidden shelf behind the skirt is square not round like the bassinet.Another cost saving "feature."It's behind the skirt so it does not really matter, but the skirt would hold its shape slightly better is it was matched the the bassinet shape and size.The downloadable assembly instructions show this very clearly.([...] help menu right side.Just click "assembly instructions" Then enter model number 00836.*I feel this is an unacceptable quality issue.No adhesives listed or noted as being recommended.This is stapled to the bassinet not glued.*This is often the overlooked item from manufacturers*+ They have a very easy system setup via web site to order replacement parts.**** " Parts are free and shipped promptly within our 30 Day Warranty period.Proof of purchase may be requested."****Mixed feelings with regard to over all quality.I wanted a round bassinet because it looks so adorable!On the practical side, the round shape also allows baby to have more space instead of the traditional oval shaped one.This Badger Basket bassinet fits the bill perfectly.The item was shipped in one large carton.My only minor complain is that the quality of the ribbons used to trim the bedding could be of better quality.Instead of grosgrain, the trims were cheap polyester cream satin ribbons and doesn't hold up well to repeated washings.Make sure you secure the velcro to each of the tabs before washing so that the ribbons would not "catch" and fray.According to what I read, this is to prevent SIDS.The particle board that covers the base of the item is not sturdy enough to hold heavier items.The bassinet "skirt" conceals the bin which is great!The cream colored canopy is useful and keeps the light out of baby's face.The bassinet also has 4 roller wheels which makes it a cinch to move.I've had multiple spills and leaks because of this.If you fill the bag to the 5oz line at the top, when you freeze it the contents will expand and open the top.Also, the measurement lines on the bag are not accurate at all unless you fill the bag - in which case you don't need them.I am on my fifth box of these bags and have no complaints.I don't understand some of the reviewers complaints about the "ziplock" top.They work perfectly with my Medela electric pump.These are awesome.baby just lOVES the colors and she is safe I dont have to worry with her falling over should I need to be hands free for a bit.my 4 yr old wants to put his toys in it and get in and use it as he personal space... great item.We bought one for restaurants (my 3 yr old is very happy to carry her own chair in, and that gives her something to do to keep her busy).It is secure and compact.This does it's job.I have to scrub the seat with a Magic Eraser because a normal wash cloth sometimes will not remove the food.It is cushiony, sturdy and stays safely on the chair.I am not sure what all the complaints are about.The color is great and exactly as I expected.The dimensions are given online and the size of the dresser and drawers are also exactly as I expected.I think the quality is great, especially for the price.I love this dresser in my sons room and it matches his crib from Graco.I would recommend this dresser in a heartbeat.This definitely fit the bill and was a big hit.The photo frame seems to be of good quality and the dated penny is a great bonus!I havn't had an uncomfortable night since.All of the different positions you can use this pillow in make it very versatile.Even my husband wants one!The only con is this pillow is HUGE.Every morning I wake up with my hips killing me.The only gripe I have is that the seam is very tight, especially at the bridge where your neck/shoulder rests so it kind of cuts in to the skin.The pillow is WAY too big & bulky & honestly, it's not comfortable at all.After she got this pillow she was able to get comfortable and started sleeping again.The pillow has the ability to be configured in many ways so you are able to find a way to get comfortable.I LOVE THIS!Why?Because my prego wife loves it.I first got her the famous boppy, but it wasnt that great.So we bought this one.I absolutely love this pillow with the adjustments I made to make it more comfortable for me.The top seam is really tight and is not flexible at all.This pillow was wonderful when I got it, I really liked that I didn't have to move the pillow from side to side if I flipped over.I got this pillow for Christmas and it is amazing.I slept with it for the 1st time and woke up without all the pains and aches I normally have.However I have found several very comfortable ways around this.Also I have the pillow slightly sideways so one side is a touch longer then the other and lay my head on the edge of the side of the pillow head area.I still really like this pillow and would not trade it for anything.I am planning to take it with me for my labor as well.Totally worth the money.UPDATE~4/2/11I am loving this pillow more and more everyday.I did have to take the cover off the other day to wash it and let me tell you it is NOT easy to put it back on.The smell of the pillow when it is first opened is really strong.I aired it out with a fan for a few days and it still smelled strong.The fabric is also kind of rough.I have had it for 2 months now and LOVE LOVE the pillow!We moved our bed against the wall so that it can't fall off the bed.I love this pillow.However, after reading all the reviews (and spending many sleepless nights rearranging my body pillow and multiple other pillows), I decided to go for it.It has been worth every penny.It not only supports my back, but also my growing belly and aching legs.This pillow is so comfortable and supportive.You will not regret it.I only wish I would have bought this pillow with Baby #1!I thought this pillow might help after my nurse practitioner recommended getting a Leacho pillow.But after sleeping for a couple hours my hips start killing me and now with this pillow one of my arms always hurts and goes numb because the pillow forces you to have one arm underneath it so that you are laying on one arm.You can see this from the pictures of the woman laying on her side.It's great!!Other than that no complaints.The little handle is just the perfect size for her little grip, and she gets a kick out of making noise.My baby liked it at first, was intrigued by the colors, but soon started to whip it around at which point it became essentially a weapon!Bought this when my son was 6 months old - he loved it!I don't worry about it going in the mouth because HABA has a GREAT track record of safety.When our baby was 2.5 months old, he would lay down under his activity gym and swat at Max.Highly recommended for fun and safe entertaining - no plastic!I've attached this to our baby's car seat.He loves looking at it, catching it, and chewing on it.My 6 month old loves Max!!Bought this for my child when an infant.Simple, yet perfect.Perfect size for little hands to hold, bright colors, rings make just enough noise (without driving mom & dad batty), and SAFE!It is light and small (maybe three inches across, about the size of a bracelet), perfect for two month old hands.This ring was the first toy our baby grasped at 2.5 months of age.I held it up for him, he grasped it and stuntedly shook it up and down then attempted to put it in his mouth.It is well made and I feel confident I am giving him something safe to play with.This ring, the waldorf maple teether ring and Sophie the giraffe are his favorite three items to chew on and we highly recommend all three to ensure variety.The colors are so bright and eye catching.I was really anxious to purchase this Kringelring toy, It looks really nice and light, very colorful , a little thick.He will hold it for a few seconds before throwing it away.But to say the truth it is very well-made, colorful, and nicely finished wood with natural material.It looks really appealing, very colorful and basic but fun.I think this might work well as a teether for babies who prefer a hard surface to chew on.She definitely likes it as a rattle (tons of fun when you slip it on her wrist).I am still very happy to have tried them all and hope that he will go through different stages when he will find them all interesting.The pieces can be clicked together, and because it never forms a perfect ball, ballino can be rolled on the floor but will go in a fairly random direction.Since this toy is too large and awkward to be chewed or easily manipulated by the hands of a young baby (6-9 months), and doesn't have any entertainment value beyond rolling it a bit for a baby older than 9 months, it becomes less a practical toy with possible play value and more a pretty and rather pricey bit of toy box decor.It is pretty and well made.For a young baby they provide far more age appropriate education and fun than the average wood block, and they are of excellent quality.My daughter has thoroughly enjoyed exploring each unique block since she was 4 months old.Everyday she spends a good 15 minutes studying them, banging them, and knocking them over.My son is eight months old.For the cost, it isn't such a great value.We bought this for my now 22 month old.He loved it.Now he holds it over the baby's head and spins the colors around for him to watch.It was totally worth the cost.I LOVE this toy, it is so colorful, well made and fun!My son hasn't shown a ton of interest (7months) but it's cute and easy to grasp - well made.My son is three months old and we got these little bugs as a gift.He loves the bee with the orange face the best.The wings make a crinkle noise and my son loves grabbing them.He also picks up the little bee and waves it around in the air to make the rattle noise.Works really well, a good height for stepping over if you are an adult.lightweight but sturdy.I love that I can step over these without having to do anything.They travel well (I take to my parents all the time), are a great price and make it that my daughter can see over the gate... which seems to calm her a bit.This gate does its job for the price.It is not the best quality gate out there, but it works.This gate is VERY sturdy and easy to install.This gate might work better for taller people.Installation is very easy (just 4 eye-hooks screwed into the wall), but it would have helped if they had included some drywall anchors.Also, since it's accordion-style, it truly does fit any opening within the range, as opposed to the gates that you have to attach pieces to until it fits, and sometimes it just doesn't work at all.Overall, this fit my needs perfectly, and is a TERRIFIC VALUE at a fraction of the cost of much more elaborate gates.Very light-weight, but does the job well.The spring on the hinge is tight, but I don't mind that.I highly recommend these.Works.Come in a pack of eight.I might get some more just to have around the house or give to friends and families whose homes we go to often.Buy them!Well worth it, even if they do need to be remounted with better adhesive.Bought them in conjunction withKidkusion Toddler Edge Kushionsand by contrast, they seem to stick down better than the corned pieces.Multiple bandaids later I bought the kidkusion corner kushions to try on the corners.I bought the black version.Overall, I think it was a great purchase as it does the job well and is inconspicious.And she works herself loose because she's getting stronger every day.We hoped a blanket cut for swaddling with the velcro would be the solution...However, two problems:1.Our daughter is small, and it is just too big on her.We hope it will work better when she gets bigger.2.If only it came in a lighter material (we haven't found it).Oh well... it definitely seems to work for some, so don't use our review as your only basis.THAT BEING SAID, HOWEVER, we found two other options:1)  When our kids were very young (-> 1 month) we used a large waffle weave blanket from Target (~$5) and it worked wonderfully... we can wrap it tight, and she does work herself loose after about 3 hours, but it is better than any of the previous solutions.2)  the Amazing Miracle Blanket (another swaddling blanket), was our by far favorite swaddling blanketOne other note about swaddling - whenever she has been properly swaddled (usually by an expert) she loves it... We initially told some folks who have a lot of experience with children that she liked to have her arms loose.Struggled with swaddling using blankets despite the nurses' best efforts to teach me.This is now part of our standard gift pack for baby showers for friends.Indispensable!I'd also like to recommend the Snuza Halo SIDS monitor: something we've used for both babies and so important for safety and peace of mind, check it out.It is warm and my daughther (NB) stays really nice swaddled.The small one is a bit too big for a newborn, but we manage to use it well, and they grow fast, so I will still use it a lot.I was great when it did fit kept him warm and was easy to put on.Also, it's so easy to use!Perfect!I have a 9-year-old who had a similar bib when she was little, and we LOVED it.It was much softer, and much larger.My friend recommended these to me, but I couldn't find them anywhere.So when I saw them on Amazon I bought them right away.The closure for the bib was neat but was on the largest link when my son was only 7 months.He noticed the bib more than he has any other and insisted on holding it up in front of his face.The Baby Bjorn bib just didn't work for us.Nearly six months into solid foods and I discovered these.They catch all the food that used to cover my son's pants and the corners of the highchair.All other bibs, waterproof or not ended up rolled at the neck, folded in the mouth, tucked under the arm...The bibs were far smaller than I thought, and the baby felt like choking.Love this bib for my 9 month old!fits him perfectly, stays in place (he likes to pull more flexible ones up to his face, making all the food spill out everywhere!)I do like these bibs quite a lot, however I must admit that I did not realize that they would be as small as they are - particularly around the neck.Overall, however, they are very nice and quite functional.We used to use theBumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Unisex, 3-Packwhich we bought from Babies R Us.Here's why they're better than any others I've seen/tried:*** They are EASY TO KEEP CLEAN- just wash w/ soap and water and you're good to go.Most pocket bibs don't stay propped open, so a good bit of food still ends up in your child's lap!Our 9 month old has been using it since he was born and it gets him clean and soft and smells wonderful.The shapes have to be put in from the top of the drum because the internal parts are in the way when you try to put shapes through holes at the sides.My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and pretty easily entertained.I read all the glowing reviews, and thought this would be a hit.I love making my baby happy.It's no huge deal.However, it should not be falling apart right out of the box!!!She seems to like all the sides, as she flips it around and plays with each one.It's portable and quiet enough.I had trouble finding rattles that little hands can actually hold and these are my girls favorite.They are easy to hold, eye catching colors, and they are so heavy that she bonks her head with them.My son absolutely LOVES the circle rattle -- it is one of his favorites.It has both rubbery and fabric textures, is easy for him to hold, and has a rattle.He loves to chew on it.My son has had these for 4 months now and has never paid any attention to any of these.They are made of very hard plastic and not good for teething accept for the squishy part of the butterfly.We started using this bed rail for each side of her bed (don't forget to order TWO- it only comes with one) since she left the crib.I love that it is light and moves easily around the house.It is also at a nice, comfortable height and doesn't take up a lot of space.Well, it is too good to be true.Let me be clear, the bassinet is useful and I will continue using it.However, it does NOT work as expected.When baby was sleeping, sometimes I tried to roll the whole bassinet our of the bedroom and into the office so I could get some work done.The sounds still work, but the vibrator stopped working after just a few weeks of use.- The straps to attach the basket to the top can get confused with the straps for the changing table.They should have color coded the straps or used a different method of attachment.- The fabric is difficult to remove if/when it gets dirty.- The mattress has holes for the play seat straps.I LOVE this bassinet.However, my daughter is not a big fan.My son only slept in this when we took him into the living room in the carrier.Be careful b/c you will trip on the legs!I was nervous about ordering it becasue the reviews were mixed but I am happy to report that everything went fine.The instructions are not the best but it was very easy to figure it out.I love it and can't wait for my little princess to arrive.My only complaint is that the vibrating function is broken!!Other than that everything was great!We have it on the lowest position, which is still a bit higher than our bed.Nothing I would really complain about.Getting the bassinet, my biggest concern was the mattress, but I find it really really fine.That's just personal preference though.I really really love the rocking feature.With my first son, we used a pack and play.And my two biggest complaints with that were that I couldn't rock him, you more have to shake it, which is not so easy to do at 3am.And I think the space is too much in a pack and play when they're so tiny.I think (and my experience of two kids has shown) that they sleep better in a slightly more confined space.So, I love the rocking.My husband says to give it 2.It's an unexpected way that those legs stick out.Either way, you have to be extra careful.But I would definitely want to be aware of this issue and to remain extremely careful.The adhesive tabs are very small and don't cover much surface area on the seat, so when I pick up my daughter to put her on the seat, if her legs dangle or if she moves around, the cover has picked right up in the parts that aren't stuck down-- meaning that they weren't very effective unless I managed to get her to sit down perfectly on the first try, with no wiggling.I love them both.I have this carrier set up for me to use and the Bjorn is set up for my hubby (it's more comfortable for him and the Evenflo)...it's nice for both of us to have one then we don't have to readjust the straps depending on who is carrying our son.Love, love, love.My oldest son used this on his bed until he was 4 years old.He would turn it on himself at night when he would wake up and put himself back to sleep with it, it was a great comfort to him.Now I have a 3 month old and I was looking for this the other day and couldn't find it...I loved it so much I am going to buy another one.The sounds are pleasant, and I love both the moving birds and the way the display lights up at just the right level (not too dim, but not too bright), but I really, really love the ceiling light display...that was my oldest son's favorite part as well.It really is worth the $.But unsnapping them once properly attached can be tricky.I happen to have a convertible and the strap hits me at a terrible spot.My only complaint is that the photo shows how neatly it stays in place, it didn't for me.. but as long as it keeps the belt away from my neck, I'm a happy camper.This was pretty easy to set up once I figured it out.This certainly helps and unlike some others, it is not too obtrusive and unattractive.I found the whole process tedious and a pain, but once on, the adjuster slides smoothly and does its job as promised.My seatbelt always hits my neck with some discomfort.She is 33 lbs so I needed something that would take that weight and be functional for my newborn.My son will sleep GREAT in it while in the reclined position.I have had to teach my daughter not to lean on it when my son is in it because it will tip fairly easily.But other than that this is an awesome chair for our kids.We received this as a gift when our daughter was born.She loved this seat and so do we.Our 3 year old son also loves it.Its a very versatile gift :)My babies love this rocker.My son winced in pain when he hurt his leg on the frame.The babies also tend to lean their head on the frame and again it's not padded enough.I like that the rocker can be adjusted to different positions.Wish it were on the sides some place where it could be easily enjoyed by the baby!Over all I am satisfied with this item.It shipped super fast by Amazon.What a deal!I have 4 month old twins and this is a great way to keep them seated while I do my work.My 2 mo old ALWAYS has to be moving so the rocking and vibrating has been a lifesaver.My son loves to sit and watch and explore.I would recommended this to all new parents.We have been using ours for almost a year.We bought this for toys, but ended up using it for a hamper.No tears from my abuse.I take it on trips with us because it folds down so easily and latches on four sides.I use it on my son's carrier daily as well as his Amby* Hammock bed when at home.One of the best baby items i have ever purchased and he truly loves watching and listening to it.He loves looking at the red and black characters on the mobile.Also, we love the fact you can have the music on or not, since there are times I think she needs to wind down from sensory overload, so just watching it works great.We use this mobile in the car seat and also attach it to the middle of our Tiny Love play gym on occasion (have never used the clip, just the velcro - works great).Baby loves to watch it, keeps him entertained (nice that it has two sides for something different).4 stars because motor is a bit loud, but hardly noticeable with other background noise.We bought this mobile to replace the one on our pack-n-play that didn't have any motion or sound.Our son, now 10 weeks, absolutely LOVES this.The clip is easy to attach and seems very sturdy.I don't know that I'd hang it on a carseat or bouncyseat arch as it would be too close to baby's face for my preference, but its perfect for use in a portable crib (we'll be taking it to grandma's next weekend!)My only complaint is that it is only about the size of a tennis ball.It's cute but I did think it should be cheaper considering the size of it.This is the size of a racquetball and the little pieces (those little heads are about the size of a pencil end) will only come out from gravity - meaning they only pop out on the side that is facing away from the baby!They loved this gift.They are so hard to shop for because you want it to be environmentally friendly yet still fun for the kids!My little boy loves this bouncer.Though we contacted Fisher Price, we ended up repairing both aspects ourselves.Customer service was very friendly, but it would have taken 60 days for the replacement check to have been mailed to us; for us to then go out to a store to buy another model -- this particular model has been discontinued; hence, there are no replacement parts available.Also, we were told that Fisher Price thought the bouncer cost less than was paid on Amazon; in order to get our full amount paid, we would have to send a receipt, which was considerably inconvenient since this was a gift from our baby registry.However, we received a second Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium bouncer and had the same issues!Some WD-40 on the motor fixed the high-pitched noise.Adding water/glycerin to the top took a little more work and required a glue gun; however, it was fixable.There are several sets of instructions online; basically, take it apart, use a knife to remove the glue around the seal of a plug, remove the plug, fill with water/glycerin combination, use a glue gun to seal the plug back in place.I love this pillow!!That is why I also bought the boppy wedge to keep on one side for when i flip and I have a pillow on each side without taking up half the bed.Wonderful pillow!This pillow is wonderful, so beneficial for every pregnant woman...it helps me to sleep better..She absolutely loves this pillow.She says it makes sleep so much more comfortable.It provides an excellent elevated, angled and cozy platform for your baby to eat!I place it next to me on the couch with the small end pointing at the back of the couch and place the large lobe on my knee.I like this shape so much better that the regular U-shaped one, two thumbs way up!This is a great pillow to support the growing belly.Not too big yet not too small.I love it!I found a simple pillow does best.This pillow I awesome!I use it in addition to the boppy cuddle pillow.Easy to travel with if traveling late in the pregnancy and nice to take to lay on the couch at night etc!I already had a U-shaped pregnancy pillow which has been wonderful to have as well, but the boppy sealed the deal.The farther along in my pregnancy, it became more uncomfortable, because of how high it was.I got her this small pillow that takes up almost no extra room, and I slept well thereafter!This wedge really helps me get comfortable at night.Though I'm purchasing a more expensive body pillow for my third trimester, I know I'll continue to use this between my legs or behind my back.This works well.We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby.We just love hearing the "crinkle crinkle" from the back seat when we're out and about.I highly recommend this book.It still fits my mini co-sleeper perfectly.I like how this sheet fits the co-sleeper perfectly.There is no assembly, buttons, zippers, or anything else a couple of people have mentioned.I bought this from Toys R Us and she slept through the night in her nursery.I took away a star only because the wedge isn't lifted enough.It fits perfectly under her crib sheet.My son loved this mobile, beginning at about 3 months old.He would watch it, reach for it, LOVED it.It was PERFECT for my needs, and it still works like a charm.Great!I bought these with my first and have used them for both.They mold your frozen milk into a very easy to stack shape.They fit so much better in there frozen into these blocks than they do anyother way I have tried.I love them!I bought this mainly for the nail clippers with the magnifying glass.The thermometer doesn't really work.I've tried to take my daughters temp with it, but it takes so long to get a reading that I've given up and bought one that does it in seconds.They are easy to install.You simply slip off your own knobs, install these with the front latch open, then close the case over the knob.They are easy to cook with.The knobs are a simple, non-intrusive baby proofing tool well worth the investment.I have these on our stove, they work great, my kids will play w/ them every now and then, they are 1 and have not been able to open them yet.The potty does look SMALL and I was thinking maybe it was too small, but I tried it out with my 22 month old son, and it is way bigger than I thought, he has plenty of growing room.and the little legs are sturdy when snapped in place, and although not tall legs it works just fine!I bought this for my 21 month old who is just starting to potty train.I thought this could be used either free standing with the bag attached or on top of a regular potty as a potty seat.My daughter doesn't seem to like it very much, but she will use it if she has no other choice.I also don't like the idea that you have to use it with a bag and absorbent pad attached.The only positive thing I've found about this one is that it is very small, light, and portable.It will fit in my diaper bag or even a large purse so it is easy to carry around.Easy to use and remove.This is a really great mobile for the price, but I don't understand why they didn't make it so you could at least turn the music off!We originally bought a Land's End diaper bag based on recommendations from the Baby Bargains book.Although it has lots of pockets, it was very bulky and didn't fit as much.I bought this to have for formula/snack storage, and it works great.I have been using this for several months now and i am quite pleased with it.The cap is tight so no powder leaks anywhere and you can remove the 3 way partitioned cup so you end up with a whole cup for a larger amount of formula.My only regret is that it's not graduated and i don't know if this is an option in other brands but sometimes i like to have 3 scoops in one and 4 in the other etc and i don't know which is which especially if I used one of the 3 doses.It bothered me a lot until I got these brushes.These tiny brushes work well on the dry horn to clean that out and as wet to help me clean the horns by hand.They are very small, maybe 1/4 inch brush and 1/8 inch wire at end.I bought these for my Dr Brown bottles, which I have stopped using as they leak.I love these lids.So you have to carry the bottle insides, cap, and nipple separately.These lids have universal threading so they fit on just about all of the regular-sized bottles in the market.They're great for when you want a lid that's just a lid (no pop-out for a nipple).These travel caps are great, I usually fill up all of my son's bottles with filtered water at the beginning of the day and cap them, leaving the other assembled accessories next to them for a quick bottle prep.On a minor note, I do wish that they would make these in gender neutral colors.I bought a lot of the 10oz bottles when I "thought" my baby was drinking more than 4 oz..but, she tricked me.These are great!I love the drop-ins because I don't have to constantly re-wash the bottles.I suggest getting a swing that will plug directly into a outlet.I have a lot of friends who use Britax and this came HIGHLY recommended to me.I loved the pattern, we are country at heart and the fabric is amazing.We used the tether and fastened it to the frame work of front seat along with securing the latch system....the seat didn't move an inch!DS#1 loved being in this bigger seat.when he was of age and big enough we turned the seat around forward facing and I loved how easy it was to install with the latch system.I was a little nervous using this, so it hurt a ton the first time I used it and I only got 1 ounce out.I would say this is great for the occasional use, but go with an electric if you want to pump all the time.I bought this pump when I ended up separated from my baby for a few days due to a family emergency.It would not be ideal for an infant that is exclusively breastfeeding or for everyday use.Exactly as we had hoped.A couple of the pieces arrived damaged (although there was plenty of protection and packaging).Directions were fine, but the pieces didn't always want to go where they should.This was easy to put together, the packaging was amazing, and the table looks great!The only slight complaint I have is like many other comments the knobs on the drawers are not very good.It was simple and very clear on the instructions..I am not a germaphobe, but I do go grocery shopping a LOT, and want my baby to be comfortable and happy while I do it.By the way, I read another review that complained about the strap not being attached and another about this  being so bulky.My baby wiggles and tries to stand (she's now 10 months old).I see kids in the nicer ones that conform to the seat area TIGHTLY - and I'm sad that I got this one.Anyway, today was the first day we tried using it.We use this a lot, the print is cute, and I am not worried about losing the simple "lap strap" that comes with it.I started using this when my daughter was 10 months old and now she's 14 months old.I don't spend alot of time making sure all the velcro is attached and I never use the seat belt since my daughter is not a wiggler and I never leave her unattended.So much better than trying to figure out how to swaddle with a blanket.Stays put and keeps them warm and snug.Also got it for a great price on here!!I bought this for my twin's nursery.They accumulated alot of stuffed animals, but because it is a small nursery for twins, I didn't have much space for the stuffed animals!!!It was very easy to put when (comes with screws).These are great.I think they are easy to clean as long as you flip it inside out and rinse it right away.Highly recommend!My baby is still young, but I used this because her gums were hurting- she hates her teething ring and I'm too nervous to let her gnaw on a chunk of frozen fruit.But at the suggestion of my husband, I put a frozen cube of milled pear that I made in the feeder and she loved it!I didn't have to worry about her getting any chunks and unlike some feeders, these bags are mesh fabric, not plastic so no little bits to break off.Our 7 month old daughter loves this, a piece of ripe banana inside and she's in baby heaven.You have to pinch little plastic tabs to release the hinge, and the mesh is not replacable.kept falling off my seat (orbit).He loves his whozit spiral!I have this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it!I can see where people might say it pinches because although it's not supposed to bend anymore in that direction, it does, and could possibly pinch.I was looking for a portable potty seat to take with us on trips out of the house.I originally saw this seat at Toys R Us and purchased it.I went back to our Toys R Us, but they no longer carried the item.I started looking online and found it here on amazon.This seat doesn't move for us.It folds up and fits into my medium sized purses and the small diaper bag with room to spare.It's easy to clean and sanitize and very simple to use.Our daughter loves Elmo and is getting to know some other Sesame Street characters and loves using this seat.I also like how the seat has little flaps in the front that helps keep the potty in place.I've never had the hinges give while trying to use it.We inherited this seat from a friend as we started to potty train our son.We bought the Primo seat after we read the reviews and have used it constantly for the last month.I would give it 5 stars.Not only is it sturdy but it stays in place.BTW we have used the primo everywhere: Planes, Porter potty, mall... and so on it works great EVERYWHERE.I've had this seat for almost three years and have used it on two children.I hold it steady with one hand and lift my kid up with the other so that he doesn't accidentally push it off.It does have a little give to it when it's sat upon (it has four hinges where it folds so you really have to kind of expect this).Hopefully this new one will work just as well as my old one.We purchased this cover for ourNightstar Eco-Friendly Contour Changing Pad.The color we chose was ecru and it looks just like the picture.Love it.I bought two of these (Ecru and Pink) for my changing pad and they exceed expectations!They fit the Summer Infant changing pad SO WELL and due to it's design, it would be hard to imagine these covers not fitting any changing pad perfectly.The price is great and you feel like you got a steal once you realize how great the covers really are.This changing pad is great for baby.It is soft and the cover is awesome.It is safe with a restraint belt for your infant.This is the best changing pad cover you could ask for.It is very soft, fits perfectly, and keeps our son as calm as possible while he endures the indignity of being changed.It also washes well, and doesn't pill up like another one that we ended up throwing out.We're very pleased with our, and the 'blue' color is lovely and matches everything in our son's room.This changing pad cover is so soft and looks really nice.It also washes and dries without shrinking.It is also nice and warm every time I put my son on it because of the material.It washes well and it perfect in my opinion!I'll also be buying a more reasonable, sturdy alternative.Also misleading is the fact that co-sleeper instructions (I have the "mini" model) state that the unit as packaged is adjustable for beds up to 24" in height.Be aware of this when purchasing.Made it a perfect height for our need.. My only concern is the ability of them to hold up to the weight for prolonged use.These bottles are awesome for storing fresh expressed (and frozen) breast milk.They fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.They travel very well (no leaking for me in two-plus months of use) and warm nicely.The ones I received had labels, white lids (a couple extra) and were packaged loose.If you run out of labels, use a bit of masking tape.When freezing the bottles note they definitely expand, even with 1oz of room at the top and will crack/break if they fall on the floor.Overall, I would recommend this product.It doesn't fit like it shows in the photo.I regret buying this.. and hassle to return when it only cost about $10 (with baby.. going to post office and staying in the line.. wasn't something I was willing to do).I bought this to keep my son's head from tipping forward while he slept in the car seat.It seemed to make him more comfortable and usually worked well.These trays are wonderful!I began making my own baby food when my daughter was six months old.You cook and puree the food, then fill the tray and freeze it.I love using these trays as they hold a whole batch of food at one time.I then wash the trays and they are ready for the next batch of homemade food.I have put everything from pureed and cooked pumpkin to spinach to fresh plums in these trays, and the food comes out tasting great every time!), but the size of the cube that they make is why I've ended up using these trays the most.For baby food, we use the Take n Toss 2 compartment containers with the spoon holder in the middle and 3 cubes fit perfectly in each side.I bought these trays with the expectation that I could use them for breastmilk and just pop an ounce or two out on occasion to add to a smaller bottle that I pumped.My son hasn't started on solids yet, but when he does, I will try them again for some homemade baby food...I don't see any reason why they wouldn't work fine for that.Our lids fit perfectly on the tray and I stack them in the freezer.I only let the food freeze in these overnight until they are solid.).I'm thinking about purchasing more of these since they stack so nicely.Our son is just starting solids so I only make one or two things at a time but having a variety like that in a few months will be wonderful!We're very happy with this product.Thank you!EDIT: March 1, 2011I will be ordering more of these trays because I love them so much.My freezer looks like a rainbow of frozen cubes!Hope the next trays I order are just as fabulous.the portions were pretty difficult to remove from the tray 'cuz the tray itself was frozen solid, unwilling to let me torque and twist it for food release.also, its cream base color is prone to food stains.I own 8 of these trays and love them.I make 100% of my baby's food and couldn't do it without these trays.They're awesome and have stood up to countless washings.I recommend them to all my baby food making friends.These aren't "necessary" but are more of a nice extra.They are AWESOME!They are freezer safe, but of course will be in a big chunk so this tray still has good use too.I would thaw the cubes in the fridge in the Rubbermaid Premier, and use out of that.I like the Premier b/c it seals EASY and GREAT and you can label the food right on the lid with a fine tip dry erase marker, and it washes off clean in the dish washer.Oh, and if you want to know the BEST book on making your own baby food, it'sMommy Made and Daddy Too!the monkey itself has a pleasant look and is soft.She loves to look at her reflection and the puppy face at the top!Plus, this mirror attaches safely.If you could remove the mirror and toss it in the washer that would be great.But I assume they think there isn't much chance of it getting dirty.I can see my son in his car seat perfectly.I have infant twins and this sunshade is perfect for my combi twin stroller.It is able to protect my babies from the sun so I can get out and not worry about the sun getting in their eyes or on their delicate skin.It attaches/detaches easily and looks stylish.This stroller is so light, and is easy to fold up and throw in the back of our suv.Up grade tips.. when your little one outgrows this.. please consider getting theJoovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Red(very compact stroller) and theGraco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix(awesome convertible car seat).BTW: the Graco Snug Ride in Black/Platinum looks great with this.Very lightweight compared to the travel systems.If you're using the Graco Snugride, this stroller frame is perfect.The stroller is as lightweight as it advertises and as easy to fold up for storing.This is AWESOME...If you're like me, you went and bought a travel system.. and regretted it!The Graco system I bought is so bulky and heavy!!I love it.We took it with us on vacation to Florida too, it was perfect.Why lug a huge travel system around if you don't have to?This little product works like a charm, takes up a LOT less space than a full-sized stroller, and is a small fraction of the price that a full travel system will cost you!It worked perfectly for me for the first year.It also has a very decent amount of space for items in it's basket.It actually has more room down there than the full-size stroller I got when my son outgrew his infant carseat.I'm also very tall, and this has a wonderfully adjustable height, unlike the compact umbrella stroller I have, although this one is almost as compact.The only problem I foresee for anyone is if they like to run.But, for normal use, it's perfect!The City Select would take up a lot more space in our car than this product.It does the job and we are extremely happy with it - easy to fold out and fold back plus it is very light.I get so many compliments on this stroller.It's super lightweight and I can flip it open in a matter of seconds.It's also much smaller when folded up than a traditional travel system stroller.I also travel with this and it's fantastic in airports.We wheel the carseat all around the airport and then check both the frame and carseat at the gate.Light weight, sturdy, easy folding!What's not to love!It takes up less room in my trunk than a stroller with a seat!Be careful of the brakes while walking.I really like this stroller frame.It fits nicely in the trunk of my car, unlike many of the other travel systems.I love that it is sold separately from the car seat because it made for two reasonably priced shower gifts instead of one massive travel system that wouldn't have been affordable as a shower gift.A few things:- The wheels get tangled up after I close it so that I have actually injured myself trying to get it open.When you realize where you need to untwist the wheels, it opens fine.- Where the car seat attaches to the frame seems a little unsturdy, though we haven't had any problems.- Be careful where you push this thing because it WILL tip over on rough terrain.It is generally small enough to maneuver between tight aisles.The basket in the bottom is nice and big and fits many items.For the price and the relatively short lifespan required from this pram, it is wonderful.Utilitarian and practical.We adore not having to remove our son from the infant car seat.Only neg about this system is that in the car seat our son is strapped in fairly tight, as required.I would be happy with him slightly less constricted in the pram but changing the harness length would never be an option as it would be such a nuisance.Thus, the babe is very very safely attached to his pram but perhaps not as comfortable as I would like him to be.It can't handle the heaved concrete slabs, cobblestones, tree roots, or potholes, and the curbs aren't easy to navigate (though I've gotten a bit used to them).Prone to tipping over forward when you get caught on one of these obstructions.When I first took my daughter out in this, the wheels caught in a crack on the sidewalk and the whole thing almost went over, so, and this is important...ALWAYS DO UP THE RED TABS AND THE BABY'S SEATBELT!!Although it is a little chunky when folded up, it is of good quality.My only complaint would be that it is a little tricky to fold.I love this stroller.This stroller is fantastic for our Graco SnugRide carseat.In response to the reviewers who said the carseat clicked into place but still flipped out -- there are two RED clips that, after clicking the carseat into place, must be turned to lock the other end of the seat down.If you don't turn those red clips, the carseat is NOT secure.But if you do turn them, that seat's not going anywhere.We highly recommend this stroller.I am so happy I got this thing.I don't have sidewalks in my neighborhood so when we go walk, it's at the park.Once she gets bigger I expect to get a different stroller, but I had expected that no matter what I had bought prior to her birth so you can't beat the price on this one.One thing, it doesn't go well over bumps or cracks, you have to tilt the wheels up a little - but that is probably any stroller with these kind of wheels.However, not a con for me, b/c my 2 month old loves the bumps.This wonderful stroller frame is probably in every baby registery because of the ease of use and you can't beat the price.I'm guessing to woman who reviewed this saying that her child's seat fell out of it when she hit a bump is actually using the non-Graco model that's similar to this one.There is NO way, with proper use, that could happen with this product.I also like that my baby faces me in this and that she is closer to eye level.I love this, and it's the only stroller I use for the first six months.Yeah, the standard-size Starbucks cups do not fit in the round one -- and what the heck do you put in the other-shaped one?!This was a great buy for a fraction of the price of the large travel systems.It is the perfect space for diaper bags or anything else you can think of.The frame folds up easily and would fit in any size car.Highly recommended if you are getting a Graco infant car seat!I realized that comfort is worth the extra money.I immediately made plans to return this item (which is wonderfully easy with Amazon).Everything seemed to fit fine other than that, I am 5'5" tall, medium built woman in relatively good shape.Maybe a lighter child would fare better in this pack.My husband, who is 6ft 2in.It fit him perfectly and he said it was very comfortable.This backup is wonderful.The stand makes getting the baby on and off easy.Baby could not be more comfortable riding in this.We bought our first monitor almost 2 years ago and it worked perfectly.Clear picture, great sound.I love the video, especially since my twins tend to wake up quietly.It's great to be able to check if they are simply rolling over or are standing up waiting for me to get them without having to open the door.Important to note, if you want to watch two children in two different rooms, you need two complete monitor systems.By this I mean that the pink camera gives me a close-up view and the silver camera is more like a wide angle view.All you have to do, though, is turn them to different angles until the interference stops.-- Camera interference: Once in a great while there will be interference between cameras, where you can see a faint ghost image of the other video.this item has a short battery life.sometimes it will die during the night even if have charged it fully during the day.this system is prone to a lot of interferences.Excellent visual image!I bought this monitor and even though my baby will still arrive in July, I have already tested a lot and it works just fine!It films even without any lights at all!Lastly, we see many neighbors children which could be a contributor to the interference.Great video quality both in light and dark.Strong audio pick-up, too.It's also compact and easy to travel with, which we've done on a number of trips already.Then, all of a sudden, no more picture, just static.I have also dropped it on brick and on our garage floor.I would highly recommend this.However after using this one every day since we've bought it, we both really like it.When we moved her into her own room, this was great because we could see if she was just tossing and turning and we should not go into her room, or if she needed us.:) It has a nice color picture when the lights are on, and a black and white picture in the dark.The volume is adjustable.The battery life is a bit short so it needs to be recharged frequently, but overall it's a nice monitor.I love that it can be plugged into an AC adapter or you can unplug it and take it with you.I loved that I could just take a peek at him at any moment.It is wonderful for peace of mind.With my audio only monitors, I always wondered if the baby was really waking up or just moving around and adjusting.We brought the monitor along on vacation and it worked wonderful there too.We also have used the monitor in the room with our 2 year old.The audio is very sensitive if you have the baby further away from the monitor.You can control the volume, which is great.Night vision is very good.Of course, you can't see exactly what the baby is doing, but I can see whether he has opened his eyes or is just wiggling in his sleep.I have two complaints:1.There is no way to know whether your baby is in the picture without having the mobile unit.Then, I worry about positive feedback and noise if I bring it into the room.I have no use for the color ability since I keep my baby's room very dark but I'm pleased w/the fact that I can see her very clearly in her crib.)- There should be a separate on&off; switch instead of using the volume dial as an on/off switch.I highly recommend it!These little bags do the job perfectly.I returned them hoping for a better batch.They smell way too strong to put anywhere near the family!The only reason why I didn't give it five stars is because the baby powder scent is very strong, a little too strong for me.Are you ever someone where that you need to change a dirty diaper, but you don't have a place to put the diaper....like at a park or on the road?No lingering smells to remind you of that dirty diaper.You can either bring the diaper home with you or toss it in their trash without her having to be reminded of a dirty diaper.These are also great if you are working on potty training.There are lots of accidents and these would fit a pair of pants or some undies to bring home and wash later.They are perfect for traveling especially to someone's home.We use these for all of our diapers... we don't have a disposal system.I can fit 3 size 2-3 diapers in them.Absolutely LOVE this.We would swaddle over and over and over and he would always get out of it and there was little to no sleep some nights.Our daughter was born this last year and WOW, I bought this on a whim and based on a lot of the reviews that were good.I was happy to have been a proud owner of 4 of these the last few months and don't think my daughter would sleep any better without this.This is a life saver!its so crumpled after wash.Doesn't make sense to me to iron them for each use?!Its a good idea to swaddle newborns and having this is better than wrapping babies with just the receiving blankets when you'll probably have to keep wrapping as they break lose so often.but this size didn't even last me for 1 month.Just too small for my bb.and there's no point having more than 2 as they out-grow really fast, have just enough to rotate between washes and through your bb's 1st month and soon it becomes a "keep for future" or "hand-me-down".I absolutely love the Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe line.Our one month old's arms would constantly creep up & pop out of the SwaddleMe.The flannel, although thin, is actually very warm.My personal preference.It makes the chair much more comfortable for the child.I would recommend getting two so you have a spare when you need to wash one.They are machine washable (which is awesome!)and very easy to get on and off without having to remove the buckles from the highchair.Fit well, works as expected, and is a perfect fit.Highly recommend.Nice tight fit around the mattress.Holds up well in the wash.I was VERY pleased with the quality of this mattress pad.It held up great in the wash & was very soft.Fits the mattress perfectly without any bunching or loose folds.Highly recommend!It's especially nice that you don't have to fumble around trying to strap on the pillow, as you would w/ the BrestFriend -- something which was NOT pleasant to do with those middle of the night feedings.I've also washed this pillow several times.If you have a newborn elevated the attached pillow his head rests on is too soft to actally keep him up the  nipple adequately and he gets an improper latch.I do like the boost his head get so I can hold his head in my hand while I nurse without having strain on my wrists.This pillow is just average.My toddler son loves this elephant, and it's working very well.We have the kind of faucet that does not have the pull knob at the end, and it fits perfectly.It would not work on a faucet with a pull knob, though.Definely worth it to skip the pricier ones.the trick is to never touch, remove or install them while your little one is looking.I have exposed outlets all over my house and this works like a charm.They have been great!We have a million of them throughout our house and my daughter hasn't been able to pull out any!For the price, you really can't complain.Highly recommend over the standard outlet covers (the ones you press into each outlet).Easy to install and they look good too!The shade was not the easiest to apply without lots of bubbles, but since it can be reapplied endlessly, it works fine if you have lots of time and patience.I bought this to use on a small 18 month girl and although it fit great around I was unable to get to fit well over the shoulders so used a different brand.I've since bought a second one for upstairs.I was dissappointed that it doesn't arrive exactly as it appears (the bubbles on both seats are red, rather than blue, the same color as the duck's beaks) it takes away from the attractiveness of the seat, but that is really the leat of my concerns.i have only used this once on a very tall and unstable bathroom cabinet.I researched all kind of furniture brackets before deciding on these.They work well and do the job.The lid keeps odors in check, but I will review again once my son starts eating solid foods.They lose a star because there I can't find an air freshener on the market that will fit into that little compartment in the lid.They are great and the airfresh tablets that fit in the lid really do work.But, the reason they are so great is that they are not too large.When you do open it to throw away diapers the nasty smell comes creeping out.At least, for humans.I use pocket diapers (FuzziBunz brand).I bought this one because of the brand.So a long time ago, I just started lifting the lid up with my fingers, which creates a couple of other issues: that I then either have only one hand to remove the pocket insert from the diaper, or I have to first do that and then lift up the lid with a hand that's just touched the dirty diaper - which defeats the purpose of manually lifting the lid, to avoid getting the outside of the pail dirty.A diaper pail is really a pretty simple concept: it needs to be big enough to hold 2 or 3 days' worth of diapers; it needs to open up without the use of hands; and it needs to accommodate some form of deodorizing system.Under details it does state that this is only 16" high.There are lots of pockets which is nice for organizing.The crib's rails are not "conventional" and are rather thick.I was ecstatic and relieved that this mobile fit!My almost 3 month old loves this mobile.At night when she is sometimes inconsolable, I will place her in her darkened room and the projection, movement, and varying music choices soothe her.I am very happy I purchased this mobile and highly recommend it.There is no need to pin the diaper - although cloth diaper diehards like my husband still can.When I first started researching diaper covers this one came highly recommended.Yes, you can probably wash it a thousand times and it will work fine, but there are so many better covers out there that will do the same.Another great cover is Kissaluv's Marvel.It is in between the Whisper Wrap and Thirstys Duo Wrap in terms of stiffness, but the fabric is sooooo water (and poo) resistant and becasue it's a solid color it doesn't stain (except the white obviously).Being new to cloth diapering, I purchased all my items based on reviews I read.Not at all for a long and lean baby.The piping on the edges starts to pill after a couple washes and becomes "scratchy."I can wash them about 4-5 times before they start to fall apart.Though they are not the softest, they do the job and wash well when mixed in with dirty diapers.I'm on the hunt for the perfect diaper liner.These get the job done, but they are a little wide for the diaper and not terribly soft.I bought this pail primarily because I didn't want to have to deal with expensive refills that many of the other diaper pails have.This is a great little diaper pail!We have twins and the pail holds enough for a few days.The colors of the pail are not the same as what is pictured.It's a diaper pail so the color does not matter to me.Overall a great diaper pail!The bristles on this bottle brush are great.They are gentle on my baby's bottles and get them sparkling clean.It's the third bottle brush I've bought and my favorite one so far.This is by far the best bottle brush you can buy.awesome cleaning tool!!!I was so surprised at the size when i recieved it in the mail.i strictly use this cleaner just for bottles but i also hear it is great for dishes as well!!This is a great bottle brush.It works in just about any size container.The strength of the bristles keeps it from losing its shape and function after squeezing it into those nooks and crannies.I also have the Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack and this bottle brush fits perfectly into the little cup container at the top of it.This bottle brush has worked just as I hoped.It is quite large, though not particularly larger than any other bottle brushes I considered.It is quite sturdy, and I appreciate that it is BPA free.My favorite part is the nubby end opposite the bristles.It is especially effective at cleaning bottle nipples.It also cleansCamelBak BPA-Free Better Bottle with Bite Valve, making quick work of cleaning the bite valve.Love this bottle brush!It has lasted much longer than any of the other bottle brushes I've tried.I also like that the nipple cleaner on the end is attached, and not a separate piece that you have to take in and out and gets all rusty.Love this brush!this is a great brush!!!my husband made fun of me for paying $5.00 but when he compared it to those $1.99 deals- he apologized lol!you will not regret this purchase!!!No other bottle brush cleaned the Avent bottles like this one did.It is curved at the tip perfectly to fit the curves of the bottles.It took me 3 tries to finally find a great bottle brush.The brush is great for the most part.Unlike traditional brushes, this one doesn't bend.Unfortunately, the brush doesn't clean the nipples very well.Otherwise, very happy with it!My 2-month-old loves these NUK pacifiers.So the colors are a nice change.We had bought these pacifiers and they seemed to work okay.I have not been able to find any other cabinets locks for our kitchen cabinetry.We needed something that was longer, and these fit perfectly.My husband has installed 6 of them so far and they have been just perfect.And I think the adhesive is amazingly strong.Because so there were so many complaints on here about the adhesive not working, I did try yanking it very hard just to see if it would break loose, and it stayed solid.We are VERY happy with them!We have a big, heavy cabinet in the baby room and I am so paranoid about it falling on my baby that I bought three types of furniture straps.Go with Safety First for %100 piece of mind.This definitely works at keeping the little one out of the cabinet, but for us was nearly impossible as adults to remove when we needed in!I ended up usingSafety First Cabinet Flex-Lock 2-Packand I like them MUCH better.this was great to feed my son fruits but it was so hard to clean I ended up having to throw away after a few uses.This item is great for on-the-go feeding.This item is almost perfect!Very simple to use and fairly small.This is a must have for formula fed babies!If munchkin could just come up with a little better cap it would be the must have perfect on the go feeding item.Pros:- Holds enough formula for 3- 8oz bottles- Easy pour- Small enough to fit in diaper bag- Pretty cheap for all of the use you will get out of itCons:- Top cap opens just a little too easily.Its very easy for him to hold and use, but doesn't leak.Its also very easy for us to disassemble, wash and reassemble.But, make note: you can't choose the color.We ordered 3 packages (6 cups) for son.I have 10 month old twins.Sometimes they leave them laying on the floor.The sippy cups never leak.Love 'em!My son loves these sippy cups.It's gross and I could never wash it out.I bought this for my daughter's room and we love it!Quality is excellent and it really brings the room together.My daughter still loves this mobile and she's 13 months now.It's so cute with all the flowers with happy faces that she can see when she looks up.We have it over the changing table because it's a great distraction.These cups are awesome.I would suggest to friends, but only for the age it really doesn't matter to have special lids on it so they pick food out one by one.This one doesn't work for me at least this young of age.I bought these for my baby when she was 9 months old because she loved to feed herself.My major complaint with these are the lids.My baby also figured out how to chew on the lid to pop them open very quickly.Also, very sturdy construction.Works well for quite young baby.The carrier is sturdy and comfortable.This is especially wonderful if your baby is already asleep and you don't want to disturb him/her just to get through security.The only downside with the carrier that we've found is that it's pretty difficult to adjust it for various baby sizes.The carrier did not hurt my back at all, and I'm fairly petite with an average-size baby.I'm not sure how Baby Bjorn is able to describe this as organic when it is stuffed with highly flammable polyurethane foam.Why didn't the company use a more earth friendly foam?????If you have a larger baby (height wise) who loves looking out at the world this can be a good choice but as noted one does have to have the muscles for wearing the Bjorn.Takes a couple minutes and is second nature.We recently brought it back out for our four month old and often use it in lieu of a double-stroller when we're on the go.I find that less people try and touch your child when you're holding them close in a baby carrier!It is really just too uncomfortable to carry them for long periods of time once they pass that weight mark.Also if you're set on having it I know there are hundreds available gently used on my local craigslist.I live in an apartment complex and with a small dog.This was perfect for just bringing my doggie out for a quick stop outside and I wouldn't have to tug along my huge stroller in the elevator for just a quick walk.I put her in this and it just calms her down.I even used it in the house to do simple chores.Its easy to put on and take off.It spreads them apart and is tight on the legs, especially when hes facing forward.Easy to change out and give baby a fresh place to drool.We put my son in after he eats.He usually burps and it helps with the acid reflux to have him upright.He enjoys going out for walks in it as he can touch and feel the flowers and objects I bring close to him.It can also turn into a baby OVEN fairly quickly, so I use the stroller when it's warm out.She loves facing outward to see everything and I love that she loves it!!Highly recommended from a very picky mom!!FYI - she is 5 months old, and we have used it a ton since birth.I bought the Baby Bjorn mainly to use when I was on maternity leave so I could get some things done.I still give it three stars because I think this would be a great carrier for a man, but I couldn't get my husband to use it.Pros:1.Well made: very secure, nicely padded, easy to clean2.I felt much better about the baby's ability to breathe in this than the pouch sling I had previously.Cons:1.This is my best purchase as a mother.I bought this in brown not long before I had our second son.I just remembered how my first son 12 1/2 years before had loved his little front carrier.He finally got old enough to not slump but still hated it.Then he got neck control and right at 4 months I put him in it facing out - and he loved it.Just happy as could be.It saved my sanity while flying across the country and in airports, he bopped around on me, safe as could be.I also wore it at a long wedding and it kept him happy.Its small size and pack ability is priceless.Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Bjorn:"Both DH and I loved this carrier for the newest babies 8-12 lbs.PROS:* It holds them close or hanging loosely away depending on what babe likes and how tight you pull the straps.* Once you become used to the fasteners, it is super-easy and quick to put on and can even be put on with one hand while holding the baby (if pre-clipped in some spots).DH can use it longer than I can, because he's stronger and larger.* There is some debate about facing the baby out and the stimulus received, but neither of my children minded much, probably because we mostly took quiet walks around the empty neighborhood, park, or around the house.My daughter loved it since she was about 3 months old.Even though her head was still not stable, she only liked facing out.This model is not too hot for summer, so that was a plus too.This is an awesome baby carrier.It works well for small babies, under 20 lbs.I like the forward facing feature.The Baby Bjorn is relatively simple to use and easy to clean.If you are just looking for the occasional use carrier for a small baby, then this may be great for you.Don't know why it is so popular!We used this at the beach when he was 8 weeks old and even at that point (my son is little, born 7 lbs 5 oz, now 18lbs at 9 monts) it was killing my back and my husband had to take over (i have no baseline issues with my back at all!).I hear the Ergo is more comfortable and versitile.I do feel much more comfortable with her facing out, plus she has better head control.Now I can wash dishes with her on my chest.It is very user friendly.i read lots of reviews on this and other sites where people recommended other carriers that are more ergonomic, but i ended up just adding this one to my registry.after about 10-15 minutes, my back/neck start to hurt, and my son is still 11 weeks (12 lbs).I love it!I have used it for 7 months, it has held up well to repeated washings, and continues to be relatively soft.he's only 3 1/2 months but already starting to teethe.its a great size, he can fit it all the way back to his back teeth but without choking or gagging.and, its super flexible unlike a lot of teethers out there.(but i'm living in Japan and bought it from a local store so i'm not sure - can't read the packaging lol).We recently bought a pack of these and they are the best cups out there.When dropped, the rubber valves stay in place.Lightening McQueen is pictured on both cups.Highly recommended.Works perfect.Used since he was born until now and he's 5.5 months old.The velcro closures are WONDERFUL in keeping the blanket held together the whole night.Swaddling with a regular blanket always led to an unswaddled baby within minutes.loved this when my baby wasn't too mobile.when he was the perfect size he was too strong for this swaddle.I still loved it and would recommend using as soon as possible.my baby loved being swaddled, even now an then at 9 months it helps him sleep.this is great!It is also probably not as warm as the halo innovations one.If you are going to get a swaddle with a pocket, this is the one I would get.Great item, you should not hesitate to get a few of these.Babies love being swaddled and this takes the fuss out of trying to do it correctly.This item definitely makes your baby more content and it's easy to change their diaper without unwrapping them completely.I started to use these swaddle blankets right when we got home from the hospital.I never got the hang of using receiving blankets and my son easily got out of them.The small size was too big when my son was first born (he was 7 lbs 4 oz) and he didn't fit into it until he was a few weeks old.Now, at 5 months, he can't sleep without the blanket (we've tried!!).If we try to leave one arm out unswaddled, he'll fuss and fuss until we swaddle his arm inside the blanket.He's big on rubbing his face and upsetting himself.It worked so well for us, we bought one for a friend having a baby in France.The fleece is quite warm, but at night, my heater drops to 68 degrees so I think it keeps my son cozy too.Took off 1 star because it can be easy for baby to get out of this swaddle, especially if the arms are not straight at his sides.I loved these swaddlers.They are cute, easy to use, wash nicely, keeps baby swaddled.My son is not generally a fussy baby.I received one as a gift and had heard all about how wonderful it was.After I got my son all tucked inside, he started to scream, and he didn't stop screaming until I took him out of it.We bought several swaddles through the 5 months my daughter was swaddled and loved the swaddleme the best, but even the large was too small for her when she hit around 4- 4 1/2 months.But the small and the large were perfect when they fit DD.I love the swaddle so much though.Its a must have for a baby that won't stop moving their hands!Easy way to tighlty swaddle baby.The fleece is very soft - but also kind of warm.The noise helps her sleep - and the wrap keeps her nice and warm.She busts out of this swaddle constantly now (because of her age, not the new size) - however, she is 4 months old and that's a little old for swaddling :)  So if you child is determined to suck on their hands... this won't stop them!My son slept so much better with these, and he never managed to break out of them.We also saved on pajamas because these are so warm and toasty we could just swaddle him in a onesie.We bought one for our son and it works wonderfully.The way we prevent this is get him to put his arms parrallel and along to his body inside the blanket.The pocket for the pacifier is a lifesaver and this kept our baby warm through the winter.We had tried other carseat blankets but this was properly snug and the material was thicker and softer.The zipper is a little tough at first but with time became quite smooth.We bought this in Soho (brown) to go with the Sahara Chicco Keyfit carseat and it matched beautifully!Definitely worth the price for ease of use through an airport and while traveling to not worry about blankets getting blown away.For spring we now use theJJ Cole Bundle Me Lite - Taupewhich doesn't have the pocket but perfect material for this warm weather.You will not be disappointed, JJ Cole always delivers!We love it!!!Keeps her warm and cozy!My son was born in January, so his Infant Bundle Me was an absolute lifesaver for our walks outside and trips to the doctor.Well we just had our coldest day of the year and let me tell you, YES IT'S WORTH IT!I love it!It only has a band that goes around the top and sits on top of what's already on the seat.This is not a universal cover because it does not work with the 2 most common jogging strollers.The company really needs to advertise that it absolutely must slip behind the back of the seat.Most common strollers it is okay but most jogging strollers (which I think is what you use the most outside) you can not use this item.This is perfect for a day at the park or a day at the beach.It doesn't take up very much space at all.I love this blanket!It is nice and sturdy and does not blow away in the wind.I use it at the park, beach, and many other places.But usually, you can just wipe it down with baby wipes and it cleans up well.You open it up, and lay it down and my baby and her friends crawl all around (luckily a few of us have one, so we create one giant area for them).It folds up pretty easily - a bit bulky - but you can get it closed and the carry strap is a nice feature.The size is good for maybe 2 active/crawling babies....This item makes a great gift - I got one for my sister and she also loves it for her 2 kids.Love this blanket!It wipes off easily and it's not hard to fold up like some foldable blankets I've used.For that, I would just bring a softer regular blanket to lay on top.But if you're looking for a tough, waterproof ground covering you can easily tote around, this is perfect.This blanket is awesome -grass, sand, dirt, whatever...  now my baby has a clean place to play anywhere we go!It cleans up well, packs easily, and is soft to lay on.Awesome blanket - everything everyone has said about how easy it is to clean, easy to fold up, how it's a little heavy and well padded is true.I bought the grey/green one - colors look great - the picture doesn't give it justice!My husbands feet dangle off the end of the blanket...we can't all (2 adults and baby) lie on it and relax...wish they made it bigger.I know the colors are a little off from the photo but I agree with another review I read--I like the actual color better.And I love the built in fold guides and the carry strap!Makes for a nice picnic or beach blanket as the material is pretty -proof (sand doesn't stick to it, I imagine it washes easily) - material has some sort of coating on it.Plenty of cushioning in the blanket itself.I like that it folds up into a messenger bag size - but just an fyi - the blanket actually folds itself up into that duffle.There is not external duffle sack to stuff the blanket into - this happens to be a pro for us - no extra pieces to lose.Only con - the blanket is a bit smaller than I expected.I was hoping for a beach blanket that husband and I could both lie on with plenty of space to spare.In reality, it's about the size of two beach blankets (which makes it possible but tight for us to both squeeze onto at once).If this were bigger, I would highly recommend.out-of-the-box it did have a strong chemical scent to it, thus the need to launder it.I love this blanket.I do with it was a bit larger especially for the price.I would prefer something I can put inside my diaper bag, it is a heavy blanket that takes up too much space in my opinion.Nice looking though..I was very disappointed when i received this item.I received one that had a stain looks like a blood stain.I was very upset and return the item.came with an ice packWe purchased this item for our newborn.It was great while it lasted, but it only lasted a little over 1 month.These monitors have exceptional range.And if I'm being accurate each monitor only lasted a few weeks.We just moved on to the second one after the first one died.The range is awesome - I was able to walk across the street and sit inside my neighbor's house, and I still had half the bars on signal strength and could still hear the clock clearly.The lights are really convenient because if I am watching a movie and have the monitor turned down (to avoid hearing the ticking clock) I can have a clear visual on whether my daughter is making noise in her nursery.The lights are as sensitive as the sound, but are not too harsh that they light up a whole room at night.The battery life is great, and it beeps when the battery gets low to remind you to plug it in.The only problem I have had with it is that if you have the monitor in your hand and you walk too close to the receiver, it makes a terrible noise (due to interference of the signal) - but since there are 2 receivers, and the volume and sensitivity are so incredible, it is easy to avoid.We keep one upstairs and one downstairs and it works perfect.I used the sling for a tiny bit, but found that the seat holds the baby in place quite well.We didn't really use the toys, but the tub itself is perfect.Later we got a tub from IKEA, which he loved until we let him go free in the big tub, but we loved this one while we used it.As soon as we got this, he loved taking a bath.We recently tried the fingertip brush and he loves chewing on it so much that a) it's hard to use it on his gums/teeth and b) it hurts your finger.So, if you have a chewer, you might not want to use the fingertip brush!Overall, this set offers a great bang for your buck, and I highly recommend it to anyone.He is much more interested in using my electric toothbrush...I really think it's kind of dangerous.Also, I wish the finger brush didn't have bristles on it.One side just has the regular bumps and the other has bristles.Why do you need bristles on a finger brush?The nipple is very soft and the base is nice and wide, exactly what you want in a bottle for a breastfeed baby.We are still using the slow flow at 4 months while I am working.The baby likes the size of these and the flow.These are not the same as the store bought Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Slow Flow Nipple.The other one flows faster than our Playtex Drop-In Fast Flow silicone and latex nipples.These nipples work!I'm not sure if its just the latex nipple or the whole playtex drop in bottle system.. but its working.. (occasionally), so I'm not changing anything.:)Of course, she is stubborn and will only take this nipple from me if she happens to be in the right mood and will only take it from Gramma if she has cried long enough to be absolutely sure I'm not there.. but at least it is clear that she knows what to do with it, so she won't starve if I leave her with Gramma..I'm glad that we have at least found a bottle she is willing to try on occasion.If she is really hungry and the person giving it to her is patient enough, she will drink the whole bottle.My 2 month old twins absolutely love this nipple!Since I have twins, I've had to wash and boil these nipples twice as much.I just love these.They're the only nipples my son likes.They have a great texture that isn't so slippery in his mouth.Great for breastfeeding babies.I currently have a boy almost 4 and a girl due any day now.I purchased this stroller instead of a traditional double stroller because my son doesn't need to be in a stroller all that often, but he still needs it occasionally.I've put it together ( it was super easy!)My son is constantly in there wanting to sit or stand on the stroller which gives me hope because like a typical boy, he hates to sit still.This steers very easily.I "test drove" it around my small apartment and was able to steer around sharp corners with ease with my 35 pound son it.The shorter wheel base, larger sunshade and lighter stroller just weren't worth $100 to me.And I bought an umbrella to add to the back if my son needs the extra shade.I bought this stroller before flying across the country with my 3 year old and 5 month old, and it was great.First of all, the stroller folded fits perfectly through the scanning machine you send your carry-on items and shoes through.I don't know what people with larger strollers have to deal with passing through airport security, and I was happy not to have to find out.I did not bring the snack tray or car seat holder since they stick out farther when the stroller is folded, but I guess I could have.My 3 year old son LOVES the stroller.He is unbelievably well behaved when he can ride standing.My son (almost 5) is still very comfortable standing or sitting in the back.I bought this stroller because I found it on sale for almost the same price as a ride on board attachment for my stroller that I already have.My 4 year old and 7 year old did like the back seat..but did not fit under the canopy.My 3 year old fit in the front seat..but the tray does not come off easily so I had to lift him in and out..and that gets old fast!!The basket is nice, and the fabric is high quality, but I went back to my bob revolution duallie and used the money from selling this to just buy the adapter to the duallie that I am very happy with.My baby regularly pees on the changing table and I have used puppy pads in the past for easy clean-up.After trying these I went back to using puppy pads.Also, I know it is a little strange to comment on, but the pattern on these "pads" includes different colors of baby hands.One of the colors is red which looks like bloody little hand prints.These pads may not be ultra absorbent, but they do just fine for us!We use a thicker type of pad when going out - but for home use these are great.Our staircase looks just like the one they have advertised in the picture and it works perfectly for us.I opened the package and stared in disbelief.Honestly, after doing more research, it's better to just use a standard/queen sized pillowcase and tuck the ends under.And they do they fit perfect.I use them everyday since we are using our travel lite as a bassinet as well.I wish I could find some that were a bit higher quality but these work just fine.We got it as a shower gift.I love how portable it is - it folds up very nicely for storing.It is the perfect size for bathing your little one, and is nice and padded so they stay comfortable.It IS nice that the seat is reclined just so so that baby is comfortable, but I always felt like my little one was cold when he was in the tub!We used this tub for awhile, but soon upgraded to bathing our son in the sink with a cushion-y foam bath pad.We didn't get a TON of use out of the Safety First tub, but we will probably use it again when we have our second child, at least when they are a very small infant.This tub would not be my choice to use at home.There is enough water to keep the baby partially covered and warm.It folded quite easily.Many reviewers complain about breaking it, but they are probably not using it properly.It's not meant to be bent or twisted to get the frozen baby food out like other silicone ice cube trays.All you have to do is to rinse it under hot water a bit and the frozen cubes come out easily!!I have been making my own baby food for 6 months now and these trays worked great.I usually will freeze a batch of the food I make and I remove the cubes and place them in marked sealable plastic bags for easy storage.The cubes come out very easily that way, no need to bend the trays, which could apparently risk cracking them.I bought the KidCo baby food processor and ice cube trays so this dish is nice in that you can dump the frozen food right into it and it fits perfectly.My baby has also recently gone on a homemade food strike so it's not getting a lot of use.I can use my blender or mini food processor just was easily.It does work pretty well though.I bought two of these to keep our new puppy confined to our kitchen.As the bottom of the gate hit against the shoe molding, the top "grippers" didn't hit the wall tightly enough.We never move that gate because it's such a pain to remove it and put in back in place, mostly again because of the shoe moding and baseboard situation.I only give this gate three stars because it's so hard to set the size for the entrance way.If you purchase one or more of these units, you'll be much happier installing the swinging hinge hardware or the sockets.Its all plastic construction doesn't inspire confidence in me, and if I were using this for children, I'd worry about injured fingers because of the sliding panel design.For pets this gate fills the bill.Mrs. Spudman is not as agile and removes the gate each time or leaves the room through the kitchen slider.Just an adorable baby blanket.We used the Kiddopotamus swaddle for real swaddling, but this has been a wonderful baby blanket.We have loved it!It was easy to attach to our table, and comfortable for our 2 month old.He really seems to enjoy sitting at the table, and being a part of the family when we eat.It's very handy to put him in while I do work in the kitchen as well.Can we talk about what a huge space saver this is?My gosh!It folds up and can be tucked away in a cabinet.There is no unfamiliar high chair to wrangle our son into, and he has his own comfortable spot in a new place.One issue I had initially was that there is a space between the table and the edge of the Chicco Caddy.Food will fall through that space, and get all over the fabric edge of the Caddy.I purchased a Summer Infant Tiny Diner, and have found that to resolve the issue perfectly.It functions as a little placemat and over laps the space between the table and the Caddy.The food trough catches a great deal of what would normally end up in our son's lap.The two products work beautifully together, so I recommend getting a Tiny Diner to go with your Chicco Caddy.**Update** Our son is now 13 months old and pretty feisty.The first two times I laundered it, I had a difficult time getting the fabric separated from the frame, and then reassembling.I think a learning curve coupled with the fabric softening a bit has made it much easier to disassemble and assemble.The pieces that are pushed upward to hold the chair to the table are lightweight plastic then the arms that come out to keep it stable are attached to the same center plastic part and come out at an off angle (and cannot be adjusted) so they don't press against the table and the whole seat can be moved up and down.Even if it fit the table safely I would still be disappointed, the seat sits back from the edge of the table leaving a big gap which I can see lots of food falling down.The fabric part is cheaply made, crinkly, and only comes in an unattractive red and black.We also own an inglesina fast chair and it's wonderful.I bought this from Babies R Us but I plan to return it.And like other people experienced, it doesn't work with my table due to the slider bars underneath that are used to for adding in a table leaf.If it did fit, I knew it would have just barely, so it was a gamble on my part.It didn't fold up nice and neat like the Phil & Teds and it certainly wasn't as compact.After trying the medium, large, extra large it seems the small flanges fit and I can get the same amount of milk out in 5 minutes that it used to take me 30 minutes with the larger flanged.Wish I'd figured it out sooner - these are SO MUCH NICER for me.I bought all three sized shields, trying to figure out which one would work for me.I bought this before I saw the lactation consultant, after reading the Medela specifications on how the shield should fit.I showed this to the lactation consultant and she said that this would be too small for me.These are exactly what I used with my last baby and I never suffered from sore cracked nipples.I must also mention that I took several other precautions to prevent that kind of pain but for sure, these did not contribute to any discomfort.These soft breast shields are good and fit nicely on your breasts.I bought two, so that I wasn't washing the parts all the time.They are VERY uncomfortable and actually hurt me while pumping with these breast shields....I pump about 4 times a day with the Medela Freestyle Pump, and had I known how often I've had to replace the shields I may not have purchased the pump, I would have bought the Pump In Style.The first is that they warp and turn a yellow color.They warp with use.These shields only come in 24 mm, so it can be a little painful sometimes.I don't know why Medela hasn't come out with different sizes of these.And they've been out for several years now, so they've had plenty of time to realize that people want them in different sizes.These shields fit slightly better at those times (since these shields aren't perfectly round like the hard ones, but are slightly oval shaped) and start the milk to flow with less leaking.After about 5-10 minutes into the process, when my breasts are softer, I switch back to my "hard" shields to finish the job.My son would not nurse when he was born so pumping was my only option besides formula feeding, which I really didn't want to do.The other breastshields were so painful for me.I prefer them because I think they are more comfortable.I did not notice any significant increase in milk output, but they are a great pair to have around because of comfort.They washed well, were durable, warm, pretty, and a great size for swaddling.I loved the fact that these were larger than the usual blanket since our baby was 9 lbs and 19 inches at delivery - he was no small guy.He's also a pretty sensitive and picky little man, but these were great.This wonderfully soft swaddling blanket is amazing and well worth the money.We used it every night during the swaddling stage.I use mine to line the changing pad so the wonderful pretty soft changing pad cover doesn't get poopy all the time.Don't buy small cheap receiving blankets.This swaddle fit her perfectly.She liked it and slept well in it.Now I use it by rolling it up tightly and tucking it into my diaper bag, it works for trips to the park when she had "tummy time" and now I can use it as a light blanket for her if we are out and it gets chilly.This is an awesome sleep sack!I put this on my five month old son over his footed pajamas and it works great to keep him warm and comfortable at night.My son loves it!In the Halo sleepsack, she has the perfect warmth for her body, and her arms are free to move.She looks so cozy and adorable in it too!I only have one right now, but after witnessing the cozy warm sleep our baby gets in it, I will definitely be purchasing more.Once she got strong enough to either kick or maneuver her way out of the swaddle I started using these Halo Sleepsacks.Due to keeping a pretty cool house, I was concerned that the sleepsack would not be warm enough for her, but they are fine.As my daughter grows, I will continue to buy larger sizes until she can no longer fit into them.I had never heaqrd of Velboa but bought it based on the reviews on this site.I havent found pilling either inside or out.We've been using this seat on our elongated toilet seat and round seat and it works perfectly.The step on this is perfect for her tall self and the seat sits far enough back for her to sit comfortably, stand up and check out her 'business' and sit back down again.lol  The Mommy's Helper is a great combo for us.We got this chair for our stubborn 2 year old who is very picky about which potty she will use.She feels like a big girl using this one and I love that you don't have to clean out a potty afterward, maybe just wipe down the seat.I think the concept is great I just wish it was something she and I both felt more secure with.It makes it a lot easier for cleaning her afterward to because she can stand up so I can see better instead of having her lean over.I helped them step down onto the step and get down while I was holding the step down.My smaller twin is TINY so I thought that might be a problem for her but she has no problems at all.This potty seat has made it so that my girls are basically potty training themselves with help from me...and just a little help, lol.If you think how many things your kid already has to have help with if they can actually have something like this and be able to do it mainly on their own, that is a HUGE accomplishment for a kid and they want to continue doing it.We've had this seat for about 8 months now.I emailed the company on a Sunday and received an email first thing Monday morning apologizing for the inconvenience and requesting clarification about which piece was broken.We have all been very happy with this purchase and I would certainly purchase again from this company.Incidentally, my parents have the non-step potty seat (Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat) and the design is far superior to the 2-piece cartoon-themed model we purchased, both for comfort and for cleaning.The construction does not inspire confidence even among the member of our family most likely to leap before he looks.There is nothing about it that says sturdy and I would never let our toddler attempt an ascent on his own (without a helmet and pad).Probably not, but that's not how you'll feel.Then there's the seat.It is very comfortable (he reports) but it is a tight fit- which means it might be great for a much younger child.My guess is you will get better quality from each of those than you do from this combo unit.This has worked great in our bathroom.We put all the toys in the frog and then were able to hang things from it's "toes".My daughter and son both think it is funny and like to clean up after themselves (the only place they like so far).Recommend it for even small bathrooms as it fits in our tiny one just fine.We love it and our 3 year old often uses the scoop as part of his toys.4 years later and it still looks like new!!It make it easy to clean the toys from the tub and gives great decor to any kids bathroom.Looks great.hold the bottle of shampoo perfectly.I love anything that make my life just a little easier with my boys.Have had this for 3 years now and still love it.We've had it for a couple years now, and have had it in several showers.It really seems to work best on ceramic tile, though you cannot let the suction cups cross the grout line.It does not hold at all on pre-fab showers with plastic/textured walls.My son got it for Christmas.Well, i'm a pretty intelligent adult and I could never get it to stay attached to a crib without looking really tacky.I returned it and bought the fisher price precious planet play mat that has three bars that connect in the middle for about $35 and have had no issues with it.We bought this for our now 22 month old.He didn't really care for it, but our almost 3 month old son loves it.The little characters are really cute and my son loves them.My son also couldn't really push the characters together to link them.This is a great lightweight, compact stroller.We bought it used and have had it for two years and it's still in great shape.The basket is kind of small but the right size for this kind of stroller.It is very lightweight and has a good strong canopy.First, my daughter, who is 18 months, can easily pull it off.A gentle tug unfastens the bib.Second, the large cup-catch area at the bottom is so wide and inflexible that my daughter can't lean forward at the table.it is very hard, you can't put this stuff around your baby's neck; my baby likes to chew on it but that's pretty much all its use; the colors are great; if it was maybe a much softer it will be so much useful.I got one of these bibs and it's the ONLY bib I have used since my son was about 8 months old and now he's 21 months.I had a red one and a blue one - the red one was easier to pull off than the blue but, in the end, we just couldn't use them and opted for a Bumpkin bib instead (the Bumpkin has sleeves and is, so far, the only bib that stays put.)perfect for keeping the baby warm and drybaby (10 months old) had no problem with it at allvery easy to put on and removelooks good!I would higly recommend this item to anyone who uses their baby Bjorn.Depending when your baby is born and your local climate, this might be a smart purchase or not.Sadly, it is getting quite warm now and we won't be using it much anymore!I loved this swing so much that we bought a second one for grandma's house.Its size made it perfect to carry all over the house.The fastenings go up in 1/2 inch intervals, and simply do not lock tight enough to secure the gate in place.We just purchased the newer model by Eddie Bauer's parent company Safety 1st.I would recommend buying the newer model, but this item isn't on Amazon (but it IS at Babies R Us).The vibrations are great, the sound quality is impressive, and it's soft!I also love the netting for indoor use as we have a dog who LOVES the baby.I feel more comfortable looking away to do the dishes with the netting up because I know the dog can't lick the baby to death :)I never used it for baby food, so I can't speak to the leaking issue.It's not very big, so if you're going to be out for a whole day you'll need to pack more than this holds, or use the small containers separately so you can put food in the big one too.And the main lid warped a bit in the dishwasher, but still fits fine with a little wiggle.I also love it because of the price.It never has a smell, and it's so portable, affordable, and it keeps food separate with the lids so the foods don't mix.Absolutely perfect.It's been invaluable as we introduce solid foods - our care provider has been hesitant to feed him solids without a clear plan of what foods are allowed.The box holds a goodly amount of such finger foods.I have no idea how some reviewers have had the experience of this item breaking or chipping.Haba has very high quality products, because unlike the US the Eu has very strict guidelines on what the children's toys and items should be like.My son is now 10 months old and he still plays with it.I get many compliments on this pacifier clip.But it does the job!Just make sure you prepare the bottle ahead of time..not while baby is crying wanting bottle NOW!It takes about 20 minutes for it to warm up the bottle (water at room temperature), but we knew what time the baby would eat, so we planned ahead and the bottles were ready when we needed them.A few times we wrapped a bottle, then put it in the cup holder...the plastic bottle started to melt where the coil was touching and there was nothing inside to warm up.I think also, since we used Nuk bottles, which have a strange shape, that contributed to this minor setback.I was really happy with this purchase and would recommend it.Like other reviewers have noted, the board caved in the center when using the bassinets (enough so that my twins rolled to the center).We thought it was too dangerous to use the bassinet portion and ended up buying two separate bassinets.That said, we didn't return the item because having an extra large playard has been great (and will continue to be great), so I recommend the product only as a playard.My husband and I received this bassinet as a gift from his parents since we are having twin girls.At first the size of it is intimidating but again what do you expect, it is built for two babies.After having it already set up in our bedroom it doesn't seem as large anymore.Once the twins will be sleeping in their cribs, we will be moving it out to the living room.I like how it has wheels for easy moving and it collapses down easily enough.I would say if you are having twins, this is a must!This sun shade is awesome.I used to drape a blanket on the shade to provide ample protection, but as Baby got older, he didn't really like not being able to see out the stroller so would pull the blanket down.Enter Protect A Bub.Ties onto the Buzz easily and forms a super sunshade.I have no concerns taking my kid out with this thing.Gives great protection (even down to his toes!)This stroller has been wonderful while my son is in a baby carrier car seat.The stroller is very light weight, easy to open and close, and folds down very small.The basket is a great size, only downsize is that you often have to take off the car seat to get to your stuff.Our carseat, an Evenflo, fit into it perfectly.We had a giant travel system that the car seat belonged to but a very small car and the stroller part of it wouldn't fit anywhere in the car- not the trunk, not the front seat, not anywhere- so we had to come up with something else.We bought this one on impulse one day and ended up loving it.I'm on sidewalks, in the mall, in airports (three plane trips later...), etc.People who live in an urban environment might want to ignore my advice...(and oh!They work really well together.There is ample space underneath.Great Purchase!!We received this as a gift when our daughter was born.I would absolutely love for the company to make an actual lamp like this with an electrical plug, as it's a wonderful night light.However, the turtle has stopped working after about 6 months' of use.For the time we used it, it was wonderful, so you can judge whether the price is worth the possibility of it not working later.The twilight turtle is a great, functional item for any child's room!I ordered one for my son when he was about two and started having a fear of the dark.I love how the the Twilight Turtle actually has the constellations and some educational value, and my son loves how it lights up his room like the night sky.Absolutely love this item.And it is ALWAYS a hit, even with the parents!Unfortunately, this purchase is a replacement for my daughter.We have had Twilight turtle for over 3 years now.This was our son's night light when he was smaller.We traveled with it and everything.We absolutely love the Twilight Turtle at our house.I have a 3 year old and 1 year old.It's great because it shows actual constellations that you can learn about and then look for the real ones outside sometime.When I changed them late July/ early August he suddenly didn't work anymore.I didn't think there was any way to do an exchange, or I just didn't feel like dealing with it because I bought it online and it had been 8 months.The stars are very bright as long as the room is dark (the darker the room the better) and even tho I've read reviews that say the stars don't show up well unless you have dark colored walls, my walls are white and the stars are very bright... all three colors show up great.One thing that would make it nicer is if the stars moved and it'd be nice if there was some kind of music option to it, but I knew that before I bought it and am still very happy.One nice surprise is that the stars include actual constellations and include a book to pick them out on your ceiling.It also came with a book to read to your child about a baby ladybug getting lost and finding her way home by looking at the stars.still super cool tho and daughter didn't regret her decision.her and her brothers absolutely loves it and is just so awed by it.you can turn it off and on whenever you'd like unlike the older model that some reviewers owned.love it.makes great nightlight.I purchased this to put in my babies' nursery.We bought the lady bug version and I just logged on to purchase the turtle one for my sons room, who instantly wanted one once they saw this one.Our rooms are pretty dark, so the red, green, and blue colors all show up beautifully.I wish I would have bought it sooner when I saw it on the shelves at Von Maur a few months ago.Bought this for our first child.It is a brilliant nightlight, the light given off by the stars bouncing around on the ceiling is far greater than i had thought possible.Granted our baby is too young to appreciate it yet, but us parents are loving it!It looks cute, and performs great as a nightlight.The construction is solid, i have dropped it from a few feet and nothing broke, no batteries came flying out.One of the reviews says it broke and hurt their 18 month old child, maybe, but i don't see how?Recommended purchase for kids of all ages (Even us kid like parents!)The stars and moons fill the ceilings and walls.I love that you can change the colors, it would be great if the images danced around or moved in some way, but they are stationary.I bought it for our newborn's nursery and love it!My kids love the ladybug and turtle night light.It's been a fun treat for them to have and makes a wonderful gift.I highly recommend it to anyone with kids under the age of 8.I like to give this as a present and pair it with the Ladybug Girl book!It came inside a somewhat crumpled box & even though it says it includes 3 AAA batteries, it didn't.I get the sense that this thing was used!The closer you have it to the ceiling, the clearer the stars are.It's not as fragile as one reviewer led me to believe.Just don't let your kids stand on it.My 2 boys trade of on this every other night.It is awesome seeing the stars in there room, I even lay in there longer just looking at them.It is a great temporary night light for them.We were at a friends house one time and my 3 yr old was going to spend the night with my friends 3 boys.I was amazed by the number of reviews for this night light, however, after having bought it for my daughter I now "get it".This is a really great night light.However, there is also an on button on top, plus three additional buttons, each selects a different color, amber, blue and green.However, even without those features this is a great light!!!It's super cute and when the batteries aren't dying the light is perfect.Make sure you get a newer model if anything.We bought the Cloud b Twilight Constellation Lady Bug night light for our little one and I have to say that we're pleased with it.It is what it is, a night light that projects stars on the ceiling and walls (seems that some expectations ran a bit higher).If you're looking for a night light with a little more character than something that just plugs into the wall, this is a very cute, functional and relaxing choice.This was simply adorable...Hasn't been used yet, since baby hasn't arrived yet, but it is just as cute as it looks online!This is one of the best purchases we've made thus far as new parents.We've had it for almost 2 years now and have only had to change the batteries 3 times and that's with daily use.The stars and moon are bright and the different color options ensure you can find a color that will be bright in any room.It does not play music.It keeps my daughter's attention at bedtime and soothes her.We bought this when she was born and she is going to be 3 now and she loves it.Better to choose what you need.We ended up using this a lot for ourselves, to go into the room and have some light but not wake her up.In fact, every night when we turn the light off, she plays with it, changing the color and looking at the stars.I think the fact that it doesn't have music, and that she can change the colors are much better.My daughter received this as a gift for her 1st birthday.At first I didn't use it because I didn't think the stars showed up very well in her room.But once I put it on a small table (bringing it closer to the ceiling), it worked great!We turn it on every night when we put her to bed.I agree with previous reviewers about the colors.easy to clean but hard to take any other place because of its large size.Would have rated this five stars, except we feel that the toys attached to the activity table are pretty cheap looking, and its difficult to clean.When I put them on, they bent the corners of the pack n play mattress, and even did the same to the after-market mattress I bought (but they fit the after-market mattress better).I bought one of these for my Graco Pack 'n Play and one for the mattress of a cradle that's been in my mother-in-law's family for generations.The pad fit each mattress equally well, is nice and thick without being too soft, and stays put (so far!).I don't have a wriggly baby yet, but I believe the pad will hold its position well.I'm very pleased with the roominess of the pockets and the tension of the elastic.This mattress cover is perfect!It IS a very snug fit.We put an LA Baby mattress in our pack n play since that is where our son slept while in our room.This mattress pad fits that mattress well.It does make him a little warm with the vinyl backing, but the waterproof aspect works well!I have a newer Graco pack n play (the type with the bassinet and changer) and bought these sheets hoping they would fit.Unfortunately, after washing in warm water, they are really tight on the long side, and don't quite go down over the mattress.Came back here to buy a few more since half the of the cups I bought are broken.But both of my 21 mo old twins still pick this cup over the playtex though they are able to deal with that fine.It's not easy to find a red changing pad cover, so I was excited to find this on Amazon.Not that big of a deal.Who actually straps in their baby when changing them?I actually read reviews from other sources (like consumer reports and such) before I bought this gate.This is rated the top gate for the top of the stairs.The locking mechanism isn't the most convenient (it doesn't lock automatically when swung shut), but it is secure and sturdy.If you don't purchase any extra supplies (either the kidco kit or your own hardware), both ends will screw into the wall and/or banister.Overall, I think this was a great purchase.I know my son and soon-to-be-crawling daughter will not be able to get down the stairs!It arrived fast, it was easy to install and easy to use, I can finally feel safe.The gate is great and works perfectly!Go ahead and buy a set of longer screws or anchors to install with the gate.We have two of these, and ended up having to do that to both of them after they came out of the wall when opening!The instruction manual for the gate itself could use some work, as the text for the instructions and the images that went with the instructions were at different parts of the manual.I ended up ripping out the 10 or so pages of intervening Spanish and French instructions so that it would be easier to flip back and forth between the text and the images.Also, the templates might have been more useful if the screw hole spacing on the template matched the actual spacing of the screw holes on the hinges.than the hinge.They're holding up very well.We have 2, one at the top of the stairs and the other at the bottom.My complaints with other gates is that they have fancier locking mechanisms that tend to break.It's really just 2 metal gates that you bolt together to be the appropriate size, and then slide into PLASTIC hinges that are screwed into the wall.Yes, the hinges that attach this metal gate to that wall are plastic.That's my only complaint.The hinges appear very sturdy; however, the plastic makes me a little uncomfortable.I know other people have complained that they cracked while they were screwed into the wall.Plastic is just too brittle to take the pressure created by that much torque.This swaddle is completely adjustable there is a ton of velcro.It is the perfect transition from swaddling to non-swaddling for babies allowing you to only buy 1 garment instead of 2.Should have thought of that looking at the product, but we didn't recognize the problem until our newborn kept startling herself awake kicking.(What can I say--first time parents!)Overall design seems very safe.The fleece is warm, but we have found that DD gets a bit clammy.We ended up purchasing Aden and Anais Muslin Swaddle Wraps and have found them to be perfect for swaddling, warm, and breathable.We got it as a gift when our daughter was born and it is one of the baby items I couldn't live without!With the velcro straps, swaddling the baby couldn't be easier.This is a HUGE plus for a squirmy baby, particularly in the middle of the night when you want to get back to sleep, not spend 5 minutes trying to swaddle a squirming baby.Another great thing about it is that you can remove the swaddle wrap.I really liked this swaddle for the SIZE only.Often she would wake up dripping with sweat!!It would be great for a winter baby though!Also I found it challenging to try to change her in it.The "danger" in this is that they could wiggle it up around their face.It works so much better than using the traditional swaddling blankets.I bought this one once my baby outgrew her first one.I have central air conditioning, but sometimes my house is still too warm.I can't find the larger size in a cotton knit or lightweight fabric, so I've been using another brand (which doesn't work nearly as well) as a last resort.They wash and wear well and are so comfy cozy!I LOVE these sleepsacks!My newborn twins sleep soundly in them and I don't have to worry about them getting out of them, which they do when I swaddle them with just about anything else.They're nice and warm and have easy access for changing.This has been a staple in our nursery.Swaddling while your half-asleep doesn't sound hard, but I appreciated the ease of this feature.As  he got bigger and we transitioned out of swaddling, we were able to keep one-armed tucked in which made the change much easier for him...and us.I would highly recommend this to any parents.The Halo 2N1 itself wasn't enough to keep our baby's hands tightly swaddled.While the fleece keeps baby warm, it does pill after several washings.We only use the removeable swaddle band to help swaddle w/a traditional blanket.All of the other swaddles we were looking at didn't come in any sizes larger than newborn.The swaddle held very firmly with all the Velcro that is attached.Wonderful!It washes up really well and is very cozy.I am very happy with my purchase.He also was practicing his shapes and colors, which was an added bonus.He was happy to have a puzzle he could do on his own, as his older sister loves puzzles as well, but they are too hard for him (she is 6).This is perfect for the 2-3 age group, I would guess, but ym 6 year old liked it as well.I bought this cover for my cribmattress.It fits perfectly(130 /70/10 cm)with the elastic lining.It's comfortable to lay on, is easy to wash in the washingmachine.I believe it would fit a 15 cm thick mattress too.I am happy I bought this one.I bought this to fit my Colgate baby mattress.It washes and dries well, and keeps its shape.Easy to get on the mattress, nice and thick to keep our baby comfortable.If you do a search for washcloths, these come back with the others.Please make sure you read these are in the "Baby" department.I was aware of that when ordering them.They are perfect to wash your face and after it's nice to run over the front of your neck and the back.I feel so much better crawling into bed with a clean face, neck, and ears.Great for several different types of washing, I highly recommend them.March 16, 2012: I still use these every night on my face, neck, and ears.The stains do not come out in regular washing but when I get whites together and bleach them on a warm setting, they are like new.Otherwise, I would have absolutely bought the second mirror.)It's large enough, sturdy enough.Other than that it works great.I thought I'd prefer a coil sprung mattress but then found that this one had won awards so got this...It fits the crib wonderfully, and is so light which is great considering how frequently I have to change the sheets.It delivered to a military box address too which was awesome.I love this mattress.I have a Nadia 3 in 1 crib and this mattress fits great.I love that it has square corners to get a tighter fit in my crib.IT IS SO LIGHTWEIGHT.I could chuck this mattress across the room probably because it is so light weight.I'm very pleased with this purchase.Fits very tight in my crib.We bought this because Baby Bargains recommended it, and we couldn't be happier.No weird off-gassing smells, waterproof (though we put a waterproof pad on it) and firm enough to be safe.We bought this mattress for the Davinci Kalani crib.It was a perfect fit!This mattress is just as advertised.It is a little hard but put the mattress pad on and it will be perfect!And the mattress was so very light I had no trouble moving it around myself (at 9 mos.It fit perfectly and snugly into our Million Dollar Baby (Da Vinci) "Kalani" crib.I expect it to be easy to change sheets due to the lightness of the mattress.My son loves straw cups, and he really loves that these have MM on them!These are awesome straw cups.Unlike the other straw-type cups, these cups don't leak, don't have tiny parts to clean, and are not super expensive.We've used a flip straw type cups only to get frustrated with small parts that are difficult to clean, and lots of leaks when tipped on the side.We've used other straws with this cup, and found that they work fairly well also.The cup will leak only a tiny bit when tipped.If you got a kid who tosses cups still, this cup may not be for you, as I'm pretty sure a lot more liquid will come out, but if you've got a sippy cup transitioner on your hands, this cup is great!On a side note, if you don't want to use the lid, kids can drink out of the cup without it - the edge of the cup is curved enough to allow drinking without drooling.Highly recommended!My daughter loves these straw cups, and the price is reasonable.I haven't had one crack, yet, so that's an upside.It's not a big deal if you're prepared!My son's favorite cup.He easily sip's his water from it, unlike other hard to sip sippy cups.The price for the Princess Take & Toss Sippy Cups when down to a couple bucks so I purchased a pack.I really prefer the Gerber Sippy Cups - those seem to be the best.My kids are 2.5 years and 1.25 years respectively, and both enjoy using these Take and Toss cups.Thankfully for us, our kids keep the cups upright and are beyond the cup gnawing phase; these cups are perfect for our family.The sterilizer works great with little effort and does a pretty good job.I bought these blocks for my daughter's one-year birthday and couldn't be more pleased.They are high quality and absolutely beautiful, with colorful letters, numbers, mathematical signs and animal pictures.I would highly recommend these blocks to anyone!It's also nice they're made in the USA.One thing I didn't think of when I bought them was how they would be stored - I ended up sewing a simple bag with a drawstring to keep them together in one place.These blocks are great!My mother in law had ones just like this from when my husband was a kid, and my daughter loved them so much that I bought us a new set!I am using them now to try and teach her numbers and colors!I don't understand why anyone would opt for a traditional highchair.It reclines so much that you could put a very small baby in it safely.We put our son in it once he had decent head control just as another place to play and look around.So I registered for this because we have a pretty small house and I figured a "space saver" would be the perfect thing!No so much a space saver though!!!First of all the seat doesn't fit on the chair all the way so that made me uncomfortable.I love this item.This is such a space saver and it blends right into the decor without looking awkward.My son is 5 months and loves to feel like a big boy.I can feed him and give him his bottle.This is a perfect alternative.It installs very easily (my 12 year old brother can do it) with just two straps/buckles.But, it appears that there have been some new patterns added within the last year which are much cuter.We LOVE this Primo Potty Seat, I have been recommending it to everyone I know who has a child getting ready to potty train.Quick, easy and compact,Very easy to keep clean and STURDY!!!I can even carry this in my purse!Never have to worry if there is a small kids size pottey or about your child falling in or having a fear of falling in.We received the sesame street folding potty seat from a friend, the primo by far is much better (I actually bought another primo to replace it with so we own a couple).Here's why I like it : Sturdy, fits on EVERY potty we have tried so far, doesn't move when my son wiggles, pretty sure it doesn't "sag" at all with his weight, folds very small- overall works perfect for what we need.Cons: Mainly the seams are not even.Item just arrived and I was excited to try it out, so we tried it in our own bathroom.He's about 35 pounds though and that seems to be testing the strength of the seat!I bought this seat because I was disgusted at how my 3 year old had to put his hands on the toilet seat to steady himself on public toilets.I am SO HAPPY with this purchase, it fold and fits right in your diaper bag..even a smaller one like a ju-ju-be between!Love this bath seat!I use it 2 ways: 1) I put this on the bathroom counter next to the sink when I want to wipe his face or give him a quick wipe down and 2) I use this in our regular bathtub when I give him a bath.The slightly angled seat is perfect to support the baby's back/head.The seat design allows me to reach to the back of his neck to wipe the hard-to-reach parts.The sloping seat also enables me to shampoo his hair and give him a bath without another pair of hands to help.The suction cup at the bottom ensures that the seat doesn't budget from either the counter or the big bathtub.My baby feels secure and makes bathtime an enjoyable experience.I highly recommend this any parents!I LOVE THIS TUB!My son also loves it.Overall, we love this tub.Our son is now 15lbs and it's starting to get a little small for him, but we have a ways to go before we have to retire it.- It's smooth and simple, easy to wipe down.Cons:- The "warning" marking on the top, near where baby's head goes, has been smearing and rubbing off in the bath -- we use an oil based (mustela) cream bath so I'm sure that helps, but I'm not excited about paint rubbing off on my baby....- The suction cups don't always stick well, but that's a minor issue as there are two of us, and one can stabilize the tub when necessary.I don't think any suction cups -- no matter how good -- could stick now the way our son can kick!I have two of these: one in each bathroom.My 2 yr old son is very comfortable sitting on them (while sometimes reading a book) and leaving after he's done: no stepping down: no accidental toilet dives into water from an adult sized toilet booster seat.I'm happy with this baby porta/training potty.My son is 18 months old 36" tall and 33lbs.All other potties were absolutely too small for my son, he dwarfed all seats but this one.We love it so far!!We had the Graco soft potty for my son and we liked it a lot.I had some issues with the seat coming off the ring but it can be fixed by gluing on some heavy duty velcro (which in an ideal would you wouldn't have to do but it's not an ideal world and I happen to like tinkering with things so...)I needed a second potty with my twins and decided to try a different flavor.There's actually two halves to them, an underside attached to the base and an upperside attached to the seat.Nowhere for startling black mold to grow.As simple as these may be, my 9 mo old loves them.We take them whenever we travel.Easy entertainment.Different textures and 'functions' on each ball.One has spinny things, (that's a technical term :) ) one is weighted so it has a wobble-y roll, and the others are fun and easy to grab and manipulate.She loves: I love them.All I can say is, I absolutely love this tub!We used to have a Fisher-Price tub, and it was okay, but this one is so much better for our 10-month-old.It folds and unfolds easily and saves us so much space in our small apartment.I can see how this tub might not be the best for small babies, but for a baby who can sit up, it is just perfect.I've used this tub when my son was first born.I also found that is was not very sturdy to hold my son up because he kept slipping down on the tubular bottom.I found that I needed to use two hands to keep him safe in the tub, therefore had troubles washing him because I could not hold him sturdy with one hand and wash him with the other.We switched to the First Years Sure Comfort Newborn to Toddler Tub and my son was better supported and has a great time splashing away.2nd, as he has gotten bigger (almost 4 months) he is too long for the tub (about 24 inches) he can no longer splash around and looks very uncomfortable.First of all, the dimensions of this mattress pad are totally incorrect.However, even before washing, I measured the pad and it was at least 3 inches short in length, measuring about 34 in.On the other hand, the quality of it does seem great.My son was very particular about the temperature of his bottle.This tote kept the water warm so I could mix up a bottle wherever we were.So easy!This is great for keeping bottles colder when leaving the house.Dr. Brown bottles perfectly.I decided on theBaby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, Blueafter much debate and comparison with the Diaper Genie.It's been great so far, and I like being able to use an average, everyday trash bag, rather than having to continually fork out for the refill cartridges.To date, my son is 9 months old and eating solid food, yet there is still no odor.I am pumping 2-3 times a day while at work and I use these wipes after each time.You will still need to wash with water now and again, because the wipes can't get into the smaller places, but they definitely do the trick when you're in a pinch.I highly recommend them!They're fantastic.They work wonderfully for removing lanolin from your flanges.Highly recommend.At first she loved it.My son just hung there pathetically.He bent his knees and just kind of swung.For $20 it does the job.But right now she sits in it happily and spins...Our baby girl is 6 months old and we've had this item for a couple of months now.Regardless, she loves it, so that makes me a happy mama!Observers wondered if she would fall out.Still working very well for us.She bounces much more often and more happily in the Graco than she did in the Evenflo.This seat is great for girls!My daughter absolutely loves it, and has been using it non-stop since we got it.I am proud to say I took off the old seat and installed the new adult seat all by myslef.The new seat looks the same but the opening is a tiny bit bigger so that the toddler seat fits inside it perfectly.She loves her new seat so much that she wipes it down with baby wipes and puts it away in the under-the-sink cupboard after each time she uses it- how great is that!No issues with any pee on the floor so far.-- the first one I opened it also did not fit.Just a tiny adjustment would have meant it would fit all standard seats, without compromising the security of the overall fit.Also, I wish the color of the seat was pink and/or had a pattern.Being pure white, you know it's going to get stained and show marks easily.We already have a blue pen mark on it, no idea how, and even bleach wouldn't remove it.Still, for toddler comfort and feeling secure and not worrying about "falling in," you can't beat this seat!Fits my Eddie Bauer pack and play perfect.It should be used in the winter though because it was really nice and soft but made my daughter sweat in the warmer months.I bought this after some hesitancy with regard to it fitting whatever brand portable crib I might own.For the Let's Fly a Kite pack n play, it fits PERFECTLY.I don't even have to use an extra pad, as this sheet does double duty.They won't last all day - I still have to change her bibs pretty often.They are about as absorbant as some Carter's waterproof bibs that I have.I bought these in a 5-pack a couple of months ago and now I'm back for the 10-pack!I love that they're reversible -- helps get more use out of each one and keeps the laundry pile from getting outrageous!We have been playing with this nesting cup set in the bath tub since our baby was 5 months old and she absolutely loves them.She uses them every bath time and it keeps her happy and we use them to rinse her hair of the shampoo.The buckets stack both inside each other and on top of one another.Who would have thought a simple collection of buckets would be so much fun!UPDATEAt 16 months, my boy still plays with these every time he takes a bath.It's also funny to see him trying to grab the water that trickles down from the buckets with holes...he still hasn't figured out that water is not solid....We bought this toys when our son's 15 months but he never really paid any attention to it until he was almost 20months when we bought him to the park with a huge sandpit.But now its mainly used in the tub as he loves to fill the cups up and see it drains.Utilizing this showing the different ways to "stack" these - starting with big upside down and going upwards to the smallest then starting with the smallest and making each smaller one "disappear" with the next larger one!FUN!THEN we put them inside each other starting with the largest - lots of ways to make his brain work.LOVE IT!Keeping it there was another.It's simple, it's easy, and it's effective: put the medicine in the reservoir, put the pacifier in baby's mouth.LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!My daughter has to take a medication daily and this does the trick!!The paci part is very soft and flexible like a regular pacifier.The medicine holder part is great seals nicely and the plunger is great to get the medicine flowing!I bought two!He bounces around a lot and hasn't slipped or fallen off.But with a baby that loves to suck on the red (and fading fast) bib, I thought this would be a great purchase.Its fit is less than perfect.i had to be picking up all the bits.. everywhere.my kid loves to suck on the bjorn.The reason we bought these is because we're doting first time parents who spend money on the top of the line baby items (orbit baby, etc...)and as a dad who is wrapped around the pinky of my daughter I thought a pink bib would be cute.The nice thing about this is it is attached, so won't fall off - but you can 'attach' a towel etc.It is a standard sized changing pad--the covers I purchased fit perfect.We use it everyday several times and my 6 month old seems comfortable.Really worth the money..I have several baby carriers and I prefer my Mobi wrap and my Infantino Flip because I feel they are more secure, but this one is great for the hip carry.I like it to carry her around when she's cranky and I don't need both hands to do something.If your baby doesn't jerk back, then it's great!I bought this for my infant but it did not work out well for us (got the Moby instead) but once she was 6 months it has been an easy way to have a free hand while doing laundry or walking to the mailbox, without having to "get all strapped in."The pattern is fantastic by the way.Very nice.I live in Massachusetts and wanted to make sure I could keep my baby warm when we went out.So I went with the CozyUp instead, and am very happy with it so far.It goes on very easily.Getting her in and out of the carseat isn't any harder, and I feel confident going out that she is warm.Simply zip-it up to keep child nice and cozy from the wind and cold.However, it has been a true life saver this winter and I'm very thankful to have received it for a baby shower gift.This is very simple to use and I'm happy I didn't spend a fortune on the others!I co slept for the first few months and then reluctantly transitioned to having the baby sleep in the nursery.I bought this hoping it would work OK but boy was I surprised..i could hear every breath that my baby takes!The volume can really go up high so with practice, I'm now able to wake up whenever my little one does anything out of the ordinary.And now I havent even had this year and it doesnt work at all.These, however, constantly made a humming noise that was impossible to ignore.We can even hear her great with her fan and humidifier on.No complaints what so ever.It was a gift from my mother in law before we were even registered (therefore, I did not pick it out myself).I was looking for a replacement changing pad and came across the First Years Deluxe Fold & Go Diapering Kit and the Munchkin Travel Diaper Kit.They cost about the same as a changing pad, but boasted the additional feature of being a diaper kit (meaning they contain the pad, diapers, and wipes).Both had similar features, though the Munchkin Kit cost twice as much as the Deluxe Fold & Go Kit.Both of them would be cumbersome to carry by hand or have dangling from your stroller.Changing pad: Winner - Deluxe Fold & GoThe measured size of the changing pads for both kits is the same.The Munchkin Kit's pad is removable (it is attached by velcro), which is a really nice feature.It allows you to use the pad w/o having the diapers/wipes right by the baby's head for easier access.Also, the more oval shape of the Fold & Go Kit's pad covers more area than the rectangular wings of the Munchkin Kit.Mesh pockets: Winner - Munchkin Travel Kit (by alot)Mesh pockets are really important because that is what makes these items "diapering kits" vs. just a changing pad.Both kits feature two mesh pockets, one to hold the included wipes case, and the other to hold diapers.Because it is actually larger, the Munchkin Kit's mesh pockets are also larger.The wipes cases fit fine in both kits in their dedicated mesh pocket, but 4 newborn diapers are squished in 2nd pocket of the Fold & Go Kit, while the 2nd pocket of the Munchkin Kit not only holds the 4 newborn diapers, it is gusseted to put more bulkier/larger diapers inside.The Munchkin Kit's mesh pockets are attached to the same rip stop material as the rest of the kit, while the Fold & Go Kit's mesh pockets are mesh on both sides.The wipes mesh pocket opens along the inside of the Munchkin Kit, and there is Velcro securing the contents of the other mesh pocket.The Fold & Go Kit's mesh pockets both open sideways.Lastly, the openings of the Munchkin Kit's mesh pockets are elastic on one side, which makes reaching into them very easy.The Deluxe Fold & Go Kit looks like a pencil case gone bad, while the Munchkin Kit looks like a nice day planner.Exterior zippered pocket: Winner - Munchkin Travel KitThe zippered pocket on the Munchkin Kit is considerably larger and its contents are easier to access.The Munchkin Kit features a carrying strap along its top, which is a very nice feature because it makes the kit easier to pick up and carry.The  Deluxe Fold & Go Kit doesn't have a carrying strap at all.Overall fit and finish: Winner - Munchkin Travel KitThe Munchkin Kit is an overall nicer kit - nicer to hold, construction seems more sturdy with rip stop fabric and double stitching throughout.The trim on the Munchkin Kit seems solid, like what a good backpack is constructed with, while the Fold & Go Kit features more vinyl, probably better vinyl than the body, but not nearly the quality that the Munchkin Kit features.Price: Winner - Deluxe Fold & GoUnless you beat this product up or use it as your primary diapering travel system, I don't see how the Munchkin Kit is worth twice as much as the Deluxe Fold & Go Kit.The mesh pockets are better on the Munchkin Kit, but twice as good?Sure, you can carry these items in other ways, but then it shows that these kits really can't replace a typical diaper bag.They loved it!To my suprise within 5 minutes Baby A rolled over!I was completely amazed.My bubs LOVE looking at the colorful fish inside the mat.It was an immediate hit.I liked the different sensory elements of each toy - the bear plays "happy birthday" (the battery lasted over 4 years before giving up), the present crinkles, the camera has a shiny "lens", the cupcake rattles, and the hat is fun to put on stuffed animals and the dog.We put a picture of her first birthday into the photo pocket, so the toy is still a nice reminder of a simpler time.We began using the Munchkin deluxe bottle brush when our daughter was born about 5 years ago, and still use it today even though our kids (5 1/2 and 3 1/2) are out of bottles and sippies.As long as you use common sense (don't leave it standing in water, shake it out, etc.After having used many bottle brushes for baby bottles (we used mostly Avent and BornFree), we never had an issue with these brushes.They were a life and time saver.All in all, highly recommended!I like this brush for cleaning and that it has a separate nipple brush.I was very dissappointed upon using this brush.I would rather use this to scrub my own cups rather than the baby bottles.The first star is for sturdy construction... the second star is for the handy suction base.And those are the only good things I can say about this brush.Maybe I will have better use for it when the baby moves on to sippy cups?But then it shouldn't be called "BOTTLE" brush, should it?!UPDATE- 1 year later and I still hate this Munchkin brush for bottles.I took a tour of bottle brushes after this.I recommed the OXO bottle brush.It is so much better at cleaning my baby bottles and is a much better design with the stand and small parts brush!We've been using this brush for about two months.When used on the non-straight-wall bottles, you tend to get sprayed as the bristles flick back to their normal position when pulling the brush out of the bottle.This bottle brush is decent, and the suction cup on the bottom makes it convenient to place on the counter.The brush doesn't have a sponge part on it, so it seems like it would last much longer than other brushes from this same company, however, the center wand portion is pretty large and bulky, which makes it somewhat difficult to get into a normal size bottle.Also, the center wand is too big to adequately clean the insert portion of Dr. Brown's bottles so if you use those bottles I would encourage you to look atMunchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush,Colors Varyinstead.You'll probably have to replace that brush more often, but at least you can clean the Dr. Brown's bottles properly with it.I have tried several bottle brushes and like this one the most, by far!Several other brushes do not have wide enough bristles to get around the bottle well.Love the nipple brush, it is very easy to use.Also love that you can put in dishwasher!Love this brush!I really like this bottle brush, it's one of the better ones I've used.I love how it stands on it's own, it keeps the brush cleaner than traditional brushes.We use Born Free bottles and these are the best bottle brushes we have found to use on them (and I am sure on most bottles as well) The bristles are a bit hard but I like the sturdiness of it and the fact that it doesn't bend when you are using it like others do.I use the nipple brush with caution because it is a bit hard.Overall, though I still have yet to find the "perfect" bottle brush, this is the best I have found in my quest!The bottle brush is OK.It doesn't scratch, but when you pull it out of the bottle the bristle sprinkle water/soap everywhere.My sleeves were always wet after cleaning.I definitely prefer the Avent brush.It's softer and has bristles on one side that helps to avoid the sprinkling.The nipple brush is OK.And now, after only 5 months of use, the tip of the nipple brush is starting to rust.I got this as a shower gift before my three-year-old daughter was born.I didn't even realize at first the the bottom unscrewed to reveal a more narrow brush until later.to everyone, so it doesn't stand out in the kitchen as out of place now that we don't have babies anymore.I even bought another to use on sippy cups at my parents' house while I was there on vacation, and - at their request - I left it there (instead of bringing it home to have a spare) so they could use it on items in their house.This is one of my go-to items for baby shower gifts now, too.Guess it's time again to search for another bottle brush!This brush is sturdy and convienent.The nipple cleaner that attaches to the brush is great and always easy to find.The suction works well- and it stays on my counter.Great and essential purchase.I bought this to clean our bottles and it does a very good job.Other than that, this does a great job at cleaning.Fortunately that did not happen, but this pad would have worked well to protect the mattress.Recently, I put them on my crib mattress as my baby is now almost 5 months, but they are so fluffy, that I would be afraid the mattress would be too soft with even one under the sheet, so I do not want to increase risk of SIDS that way.I think they might be better to put under the crib sheets when my child is a little older and not at risk for SIDS, but at higher risk for nighttime leaks.Make sure you get the bigger size though.As others have said, for the price of the BOB, it should come with this - and maybe even some other accessories!We have the Dualie SUS and this really looks kind of comical on it...  the zippered pouch is SO tiny.Why is it so tiny???My camera fits in it and nothing else.I have no complaints about the size of the water bottle holders as all I use those for is to stash bottles/sippies when the kids hand them back to me.This item is really just meh.Would be nice if they included it, but since you have to pay extra, consider other options.This is so great for that in between time when all they want to do is walk holding on to your fingers, but your back hurts to bend over for so long.I would have given it 5 stars, but it would be nice if there was a bit more support for the chin/neck/shoulder area - my niece LOVED it and was so happy to have her hands free.I prefer to use it outdoors with my 8 month old.Will work great this summer on outdoor trips!My back was killing me to walk with him around the house while holding his little hands.I just follow my baby around the house and allow him to explore it.My parents who are close to 70 are especially grateful and take the kid for a walk outside in the wings.My whole family LOVES it!I bought this for my baby, and it really was very helpfull for us during the learning to walk stage.like the design and the bright colors.Bottles are great for warming up, though.These bottles and storage system are useful and fulfill the purpose of keeping everything straight and organized.I bought these as extras along with the nipples and caps.This gate looks really nice compared to other baby gates I've used (I have the black one), was easy to install (we're using it pressure-mounted) and is easy enough to open for an adult but hard for a small child.I love that it's tall, as I don't need to bend down uncomfortably when I'm holding my eight-month-old.This extra tall baby security gate is ideal for many areas where one would want a safety gate.For example, if you've got molding along the wall such that the little round parts that touches the wall cannot be flush, or if you've got molding on your bannister such that the round parts that attach there cannot be flush.Whereas the instructions say you have to have this gate touching the floor, there are places where you can get away with having it slightly above the floor.As I mentioned, I have 3 of these particular gates installed.Of course, that means I have two extra extensions that I don't need.The operation of this gate:I love it.After all, you have to go through the gate over and over again everyday, and you don't want to make this event an ordeal.Top of stairs:Oh, how I hated installing a gate for top of stairs.This is the most sensitive place to install a gate.Here's my recommendation for top of stairs:KidCo Safeway Gate - White.Just as I found the Dreambaby gate the simplest and best for most uses, I found this one simplest for top of stairs.Operation of the gate is a dream.This gate is fantastic.I didn't realize it had the capability to screw into the wall, as well as be a pressure gate.It's perfect for keeping our little crawler confined to one area.The self-closing feature is also great.I have only good things to say about this awesome gate!We have these blocking our stairs so our 15 month old daughter can't fall down them.She has figured out that the latch needs to slide in order to open the gate, but can't open it due to the safety feature of having to lift the gate slightly to open it.Make sure you position it correctly or the swing closed feature will not work properly, but when you have it correctly aligned and tightened this is a great feature for the gate and has been really helpful!We got this set with the extensions because the width of our stairwell measures 35.5" so we thought the gate with the 3.5" extension would be a perfect fit.However, when we received the gate and set it up as such it seemed less sturdy than we had hoped because the buffer pads we extended near their full length.So we switched to the 7" extensions which was a closer fit to the opening but make for a much tighter/safer fit all around!I purchased this gate because I needed a tall gate and the price seemed good compared to others.When My husband and I became foster parents we wanted to keep the dogs out of the kids room so we bought this gate.It was easy to put up, I think my husband did it in 10 minutes.We love this gate so much we bought a second one when we got the three because we needed two bedrooms, instead of one.We have lots of people come in and out of our home to check on the children and their progress and one of the first things everyone says when they go into their rooms is how nice that gate is.(We have taught the older children to leave it slightly open so it does not lock just because I love this gate and want it to last forever.)One of our gates is black and the other is white and they both look great although I'm partial to the black one.It's aesthetically pleasing, durable, reliable and easy to operate.My husband and I are fairly tall and it's nice not having to bend down at all to open them.We don't mind because we know they'll be there for at least a few years until we're done having children.When the gate arrived, it was way off....the gate without the extensions is much shorter than what I had expected it to be from measurements listed online.On top of that, the gate we received was defective.It involves hardware to install which is the only downside but the measurements were correct and the gate actually works!I will say, Amazon took the gate back with no issues and UPS picked the gate up from our house the day after we requested a return, so kudos to them for their customer service!This was a gift for father's day for him.I got this for my husband but he never used it.This bag is huge and carries everything for a baby.Here's my list:In the 3 small pockets in front - 3 bibs, 5 small washcloths, 5 of those just-add-water napkins, my phone, a pen and car keys.In the bag - 5 diapers, 2 musical toys, a whole package of wipes, nursing wrap, my wallet, a blanket, changing pad it came with and a full bottle of hand sanitizer (not the little travel  size) and 2 spare onesies.There is another pouch inside where I keep ointment and nursing pads.In the back of the bag, there's a pouch area where I keep a plastic bag and some ziploc bags to put dirty diapers in if there's no trash around.The strap even has a pocket where you're supposed to keep your cell phone.We're both very happy with this product and the dragon image is just too cute!I thought that it did the job, but I still had trouble getting everything to fit and stay organized there.It would have been nice if there were more pockets and compartments on the inside, otherwise everything was just dumped into the same area.The outside pockets are perfect for storing diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, pacifiers, toys, etc.Inside there is a nice zippered pocked that I use for my wallet and keys.Also the great changing pad has it's own pouch inside the bag.Plus the changing pad is nice sized and folds up into a neat little square with a velcro tab that holds it closed.Plus I wouldn't want the extra bulk of a squishy changing pad.I can get my baby ktan sling in there, bib, change of clothes, blanket, formula, and bottles in there with a little extra room to spare.The back pockets are perfect for a bottle and anything else you just need to slip in the bag.You'd only be able to fit a small flip phone in there the pocket is way too small.Wish it were larger as I would have liked to use it.If you happen to live in a tiny studio without a full kitchen this is a great thing to have.Got this for my daughter when she started crawling...it was great for encouraging her to keep going; she really liked the chime.Now, at 3 years old, she has a lot of fun playing catch with it in the house!It has been through the washer and dryer (gentle cycle) countless times and still looks like new.My son is 6 months old and are BLW ( baby-led weaning) so it's a little bit messier than the usual solids plus he's moving a lot in his high chair so a lot of the food ends up on his clothes right under the chin where this bib doesn't close easily.I am in love with this bib.Goodness!Usually it will end in her shoving the bib in her mouth so that she can't eat the food or she is crying for me to take it off.She usually has food on her lap, but not a drop.The bib was long enough to keep her lap covered and the pockets caught what she dropped.I only needed to wipe her hands and face.And she thought it was a shirt, so she didn't pull on it or stick it in her mouth, no tears.It has been a lifesaver too for my messy girl.I bought two of these so I could always have one clean.I think the only thing that would work even better is to have little legs sleeves as well.Great bib and well worth the price!I do wish they came in solids though.These are not just great-looking bibs, they're great performing bibs too.Heavy-duty, water/spill proof, sturdy stiching, easy to clean, a nice big pocket, and one of my favorite features is the elastic edges on the sleeves that helps keeps shirt-sleeves clean.We've purchased a few of these Bumkins bibs and have loved every one - they are made to last and look great on top of being very functional.The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the price - I do think they could do a little better in that department.this bib is great.it really helps make clean up so easy.now i just take the bib off and wash the tray.I bought these bibs for my daughter's twins.These bibs do a wonderful job of keeping their clothes clean.She said someone always asks about them when she uses them in a restaurant.I can vouch for that because we went out for two meals during a recent visit and, both times, we were asked where she bought them.I think these are going to be my first choice of baby shower gifts in the future.They may not need them when the baby first arrives, but they will see much use after they start solids.this bib is good for covering the sleeves, but it does not cover much of the lap while in a highchair.i bought this for my then 7-month old but it was so big it distracted him from eating.at 9 months, still have to roll the sleeves, and i don't use it much... perhaps will make a good smock later on...I bought these bibs for my twin grandchildren because their mother loved the long sleeved ones so much.(this is a quote from the description: "This full coverage bib features a catch all pocket and tie closure.")She prefers the ties because she has found that the Velcro doesn't hold as well after several washes.I bought this for my daughter when she was 18 months and used it as just a bench until she was 21months.It is the perfect height for her to get on and off of by herself and the pull out drawer makes for easy clean up!I have an Evenflo convertible carseat which I am still using rear facing for my 19 month old.I did not get the seatsaver version with the taller part on the back because I already had a kick pad for my son to protect the seat back.I have a newer model Honda Civic and this seatsaver does not fit well from front to back, the pockets are way up on the seat and unusable for storage.The saver does NOT move around on the seat and it is easy to get to the LATCH system since the notches are large which is nice.So no I would not recommend it for a convertible carseat in an '09 Honda Civic.Kit not only keeps the seat protected from food but also kids dirty shoes.Although I'm not sure how well an infant eyes are, he did seem to look up at the lights occasionally, but he mostly liked the music at this age.While he was younger the color and shapes of the actual toy seemed to keep him happy, and occasionally he would accidently turn the music on.Now at 18 months my son still plays with this toy daily.Well worth it!*Baby loves it!*Wish there was a remote control to use while baby was still to young to turn off and on himself.*Wish there were additional design discs to purchase.This shape sorter is simple, takes no batteries, and kept my duaghter occupied for a long time.That being said, she really did enjoy crawling over to it, pulling out the animals and either crawling away with them or sucking on them, and they are large enough that I didn't have to worry about her choking or getting them stuck in throat.Either way, the bright colors are fun and it provides some good entertainment.I LOVE it because it makes NO NOISE!!!Love the price of these lined baskets to go with the changing table I bought from a friend.They fit perfectly and love the various colored ribbons that are included to change the use and appearance of the baskets.Love Amazon.Works great.Easy to carry in my purse for whenever I need it.I find this to be one of the most helpful items I have.This strap has fixed both those issues.It is a wonderful pillow--except the area where your neck goes is very uncomfortable!The seam of the inside curve on both ends is sewn while pulled very tightly, so when I position my head on top, this tight seam digs into my shoulder.I have tried to ease it by pushing it up against the headboard, or making sure the whole pillow wasn't held taut, or draping it with an extra pillowcase, but nothing I do has helped.I origianlly bought a preggle which I like, but if I wanted to change sides, I had to move the pillow.A must have and worth every penny!The way it is designed, my head does not lay at the correct angle and it's uncomfortable.I have to toss and turn to get comfortable.Also, it only comes with a white cover...they do not make any other colors for this model.And it is very difficult to remove.And you cannot return it unless it is unopened.Great!First, the fabric is a little scratchy (feels like a cotton/poly blend).Second, the inside seams are pulled too tight, so you have to adjust sleeping positions (in order not to have it dig into your neck).This thing is too big for what it accomplishes.It could be much more compact.All the essentials for a quick trip anywhere.Love the changing pad.... comes in very handy.A few things could be improved, but overall it is useful and a decent price for what you get.Pros: It is well constructed and holds all the essentials.The diaper pocket holds 2 cloth diapers for me (BG AIO's).As far as utility, it's a little heavier than I expected, and I don't like the idea that the area that would lay on the floor/diaper changer would be "exposed" to the inside of my purse/bag if I put this inside another one.We are very happy with this.It holds up to 8 small diapers, extra wipes, and a small outfit.Below are the main points I can speak to from my experience:Pros*  Size - This size was just perfect for day trips.I loved the fact that it all condensed down into a small sized satchel that could be tossed under the compact stroller or hung on the handle without taking up a lot of space or getting in the way.I thought the size of this was perfect for on-the-go short adventures.*  Function - I really  liked the fold out pad.Though my daughter didn't really care about its aesthetics, I liked the pattern on the changing pad.Its surface was smooth which made it really easy to clean.Also, I liked the size of the changing pad - I found that there was plenty of room for baby.*  Size - I'm not sure this is a con, but some people would probably find that it's just too small.The opening for the wipes is a tight fit.Well, yeah.Which is the point:  This is a very compact bag, suitable - in my experience - for outings that lasted hours, not days.Final ThoughtsI should also mention that I found the small plastic wipes case that came with the bag to be useless and just tossed it; travel-sized wipes packages are the perfect size for this bag and are usually resealable.It is specialized, though, and not something that you'd take on an extended trip.For this daddy it was perfect, but that may not be true of others.This seat works well on non-elongated toliet seats but doesn't when encountering an elongated one.The rear of the seat depends on resting on top of the rear of the toliet seat, so your child's leg/foot is left touching the bare front ceramic part of the client.While folded it is a rectangular shape of 6x4x3.Thanks for creating a phobia for my son, Mommy's Helper.They haven't used it yet but it's fantastic for taking out and about, because after all you should be able to potty train on the go.I love being prepared.I am a HUGE fan of Britax.When I got the seat I instantly loved it.The Onyx color looks nice..the fabric feels nice and would clean up easily.She is only 25% for her height and she is at the max height for rear-facing in this seat.I returned the Roundabout to Amazon (which they are awesome with returns).Its not worth it to not do it right.I splurged a bit (for my conservative budget) and bought the Britax Roundabout convertible car seat, and I have not been disappointed.I absolutely LOVE this car seat.It is built so well and is so sturdy.I feel so safe knowing that my son is in a Britax.The seat belts are great because they adjust and loosen very easily, so it is very easy to get my son in and out.Do your research, and I think you will find, like I did, that Britax is definitely the way to go!Why this vs. Safety First Bed Rail?Size - it's all about size.This was the perfect length to cover from my son's current bed's side rail to the edge.The Safety first is great if we need 60+inches...but we didn't.Just seemed like it would be uncomfortable for my son - he likes to roll to the side/edge of the mattress and curl up.Also this was 1/2 the price of Safety First.Instructions - it's literally 8 lines - no photos, and takes some intuitive thinking on getting this thing put together.It took about 10 minutes with trial and error.Toddler bed - this didn't seem like it was made for a toddler bed b/c the anchor straps were really long and the disc went out further than the edge of the bed.With a little fiddling around and tying the strap to the slats of the bed, it works.It's enough to keep my child in when he's sleeping - but it doesn't deter him from wanting to climb over it when he's awake.Rather be safe than sorry (our mattress is a few inches shorter than they suggested instructions).You definitely get a good value for the $$ - there's no point paying $40 for another bed rail if you don't need the length.Easy to get on and off to boot!The seat itself is nice and cushy for baby.The back pocket of the bag is large enough to hold several diapers, wipes, extra toys, burp cloths, extra onesies.- First of all, the fabric print is adorable.There are little loops in the front where you can link toys, which is awesome because your baby can't throw them out of the cart.We bought this because our daughter needed something besides the jumperoo to get her moving.She really likes the ability to be able to move around and explore.We liked the activies a lot better on this one because it has more that you can do.The others just don't add up when it comes to play items that are included with the price.Very easy to put together and easy to adjust from one height to the other.Awesome find!Other than that, very satisfied: Safe, fun, cheap!easy to put together.moves easily and is entertaining.its a great value.That being said- this dresser was a good pick.It actually looks pretty nice that way.At first, I thought the dresser was nice.This is a relatively nice piece for the price.It looks nice in our nursery, it is true white so it matches our Graco cribGraco Victoria Non Drop Side 5 In 1 Convertible Crib White, and is sturdy.The assembly wasnt as difficult for my husband as previous reviewers experienced.There are a lot of pieces and it took some time but it wasnt that challenging.My only complaint is the height of the piece - which is clearly stated so this is my own fault.I'm about to become a first time mom and didnt realize a tall changing table with a thick changing pad might work for a very tall mom but not for me.Also, this piece requires a smaller (30") changing pad instead of a standard 32" pad.The LA Baby 4 sided 30" changing padLA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 30", Whitefits great.I would purchase this again for the look & quality but probably not for the heightReally easy to put on/off and adjust if needed.Better sun protection than the compact version (but that is kind of a no-brainer).Easy to put on and remove.Like others have said, this organizer is great because it is flexible.The cup holders are so floppy, most drinks (and sippy cups) flip over in them.The middle compartment is so small, I hardly feel comfortable placing my cell phone in there.The large mesh pocket is a great size, but the velcro closure on top is so darn sticky, it's impossible to open with one hand.I don't know why they call this a "mobile" since it has no moving parts, no motion or sound, it just hangs there.That being said, this is the best toy I've gotten for my 10-week-old son so far.I don't know why he loves it so much, but now the changing table is his absolute favorite place to be.He is easily contented with the lights and butterflies overhead.He sits up now and just fits under the arch, though I usually set him at the edge of the mat.Great!It has lights and bright colors which my daughter loves.Great music and nature sounds.I borrowed this from a family member for our now 6 wk old and she loves it...especially the changing lights at the top.Would be nice if it included a thick pad for underneath the mat for extra comfort & support.It's nice to have, worth its price, and quality is pretty good, I can give this to another child now and it still looks brand new.My daughter is 2 1/2 months old and she already loves this.My only complaint is that the two butterflies underneath the sound box don't spin on their own.I also like the music (it isn't tinny sounding like some) and the forest sounds make my daughter's eyes go big and round.I received this as a gift and in addition to her bouncer, this is her favorite item.It is of a fair size which will accommodate your baby with space to spare.It has a set of 4 color lights on top, shining and catching the attention of your baby.It also has music with 2 volume settings.My baby boy is not 3 months yet and he just lays there watching everything and trying to grab all!:-) I would highly recommend this mat, it helps your baby with his/her motor skills.I love this activity mat.I wish that the butterflies didn't get in the way of the flashing lights at the top though.She is 9 months now and she still climbs on top now once in a while (with supervision since I don't think it was specifically designed for that) so it has gotten tons of use.One of the settings has the music come on if she shakes the canopy is a really great feature.We paid 69.99 at Babies r Us, so this is a great price for it.Our baby is only a month old but is developing rapidly and rarely sleeps for long so we have been looking for ways to keep her occupied and gently stimulated.This playmat has been a wonderful choice!The music seems to keep her attention as well.I bought this playmat for my second son.The music has volume control - which I love, and an option to stop playing until activated by the baby moving the poles.Our daughter loves this gym.The minute we got it, I set it up and she's loved it ever since.Pros:- TOYS: All of the toys that come with the gym can be moved around.She loves the monkey and the bird that rattles.It also will play nature sounds in the middle of the songs or has a setting specifically for nature sounds.I know there's a setting for the music to start up whenever she bats at the butterflies but it doesn't ever work because she'd have to grab them and tug pretty hard.- The mat doesn't pack away easily, so be prepared for this to take up some floor space.- This is neither a con nor pro but a clarification: I thought the leaves would move up and down just like i thought the mobile would spin.I just didn't think with the cons it deserved 5 stars.Maybe I would try another floor gym out for variety, but I'm not at all dissapointed with my first floor gym purchase!I got this for my daughter who loves it, it is very easy to assemble.My baby loves to be inside this.It's perfect for tummy time so baby's little face isn't mashing into the carpet.My only complaint is that it doesn't store well.This was not the mat I registered for, but got this mat from a family member when my son was a few months old.At six weeks, our son started kicking more and wanting a little independence.We pulled out the rainforest that was a gift from an aunt and found that he loved it.He can spend an hour in the rainforest just as happy as he can be.It was necessary to move the toys around to make them accessible to him.It truly entertains him, and I highly recommend it.My baby hated tummy time until I bought this...He was less than 3 months and he was already rolling over.I'm pretty sure this helped him a lot, toys and sounds encouraged him to move from side to side giving him the necessary impulse to roll over.For me it has given me the opportunity to put her down, knowing she will be happy for around twenty minutes, and I'll have the chance to get something done.It's really impressive, has lights and sounds that capture baby attention for longer.Bring a monkey, an elephant rattle, a parrot who sounds like the move, another bird rattle, and the larger giraffe has a mirror.You have the option to turn sounds through movements of the baby.When baby shakes the toys melodies start to sound.Of course it also has the option to play all the time.Im more than happy with this purchaseThe gym is very well done and really beautiful, I would recommend this to everyone!PD: I also buy this: http://www.amazon.com/Piper-Panda-black-white-travel/dp/B0033BXZ3M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1293559604&sr;=8-1Piper panda for attach to the gym, the toy looks a little cheap but my baby loves it and she loves more her gym because of this toy!I purchased this activity mat from Amazon a few months ago for my son and while he loves the mat, I do have some lingering questions.1.Does it hurt him?I suspected that one was a zebra, but my husband insists it is a snow tiger.I like to verbally label things as my son looks at them but these two have me stumped.3.Lot's of fun things for baby to play and entertain thereself with.And it's musical!!We also have a BOB Revolution, (BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Black), which is awesome, so perhaps my discontent with the Chicco Capri is a result of being spoiled by my wonderful, amazing, incredible BOB stroller.this is the second chicco capri stroller we bought.we bought the tangerine one for my son and this topazio one for my daughter (i don't like the pink one).We have a larger one with an integrated/removable car seat.The canopy on this one works well and this stroller is built solid enough, yet is very lightweight.I actually prefer this one over the larger, bulkier one that we have.It does have some minor issues though.Your mileage may vary depending on the size of your feet.All the bowls and lids are great, but I especially love the sippy cups.The Take & Toss Feeding Variety Pack includes every utensil you'll need to start your baby on solids.The spoons are excellent for feeding the baby, much better than theMunchkin Soft-Tip Infant Spoon - 6 Pack, Colors May Varythat I also have but don't use much other than giving to my son to hold during meals.All of the items have held up great after numerous washes.The variety pack is definitely a great buy!I love this!!Highly recommend!I really like the different sizes of containers for daycare meals/snacks.I use the smaller containers for puffs or other small snacks.just the perfect thing to  help tiny cloggy noses.Great and safe tool for taking out boogies!Amazon does sell the Pigeon nail clipperBaby Clear Cut Nail Clipper Pigeon (new yellow color Made in Japan), I haven't tried this myself but I prefer the scissors over nail clippers in general.My baby isn't here yet.. but my sister swears by these booger tweezer.I have a feeling that they will work well for us too!Of course she doesn't like it too much, but after each time a big snot comes out, she seems happy!Easy to hold and easy to use!It works very well on cutting his tiny nails.Love this rattle.I like the different shapes and textures.Great color and design.She doesn't seem to care much for the spinning part, nor does she use it as a teether but it's definitely good to make lots of noise with!I shopped around a lot before I settled on this kit, but as others have mentioned there are serious quality issues.The bulb syringe is very hard, and difficult to use.The nail clippers sort of dented my son's nails but did not cut at all.Fortunately, this kit comes with nail files which helped deal with the aftermath but if clipping an infant's nails is difficult, try filing them.The brush and comb seem useful, and the nail files worked.For the price, most prospective buyers will be better served by acquiring the items they need individually, and getting good quality.Also, consider that a baby shower will generally yield at least one brush and comb set, and the hospital will send you home with a better bulb syringe and thermometer.I was gifted this from my registry and since baby was born I've used the following:~comb: when oiling scalp and working out cradle cap~brush: every night...it's great~nose sucker: for the obvious~nail clippers: also obvious, though I did ONCE nip a pinky tip the size of a pin prick, otherwise they work well~nail files: when I decided it was too soon to use clippersI doubt I'll ever use:~thermometer: I bought a digital ear one~syringe: it's not very ergonomicWill one day use:~medicine dispenser: once he's bigger...BUT I may buy one of those alligator ones that I remember from my childhood.All in all, it's a decent value.Nasal aspirator (which is amazing), nail clippers and brush... that's the only items that worked.I'd give it 5 stars otherwise because the neck closure is adjustable to a small neck opening unlike many bibs out there and the material is of quality.I haven't had any issues with the pocket not catching food that slides down the bib.It washes very well and has withstood many washings without showing any signs of deterioration.Updated after almost two years:it was not a good starter bib, for the first foods the BabyBjorn is much better.But once we got there, this is great!--------------------------------Old reviewI'm not saying it is bad, although it is not that easy to clean as i expected as the food gets stuck on the edgesBut your baby will grab it and put it easily in her mouth and make a big messthe rubber one from BBjorn is so much better as the baby can not bend itI find it a wonderful bib, as does my daughter, who prefers this one over others that I have (they are stiffer).The material is soft, easy to wash and dry, easy to put on and take off - my daughter does it herself - (it has velcro, as compared to other bibs, that have a snap on or strings that you have to tie), the neck opening is adjustable (because of the velcro, again), and many of the colors are unisex; what more could one want from a pocket bib?It cleaned up really easily but my daughter hated the feeling of the bib on her neck and always fussed when I put it on.Bumkins bibs are GREAT.Catches the food, fits well and works as expected.I love the size of all 3 baskets.The largest will hold diapers, the medium size will probably hold wipes & the smallest will probably hold any lotions, powders, creams or anything else we need for diaper changes.It's real easy to put together, took me about 40min.It's rock solid.Espresso is a good color also.Love it.Have been using this crib for our daughter for 4 months now and we just love it.It was easy to assemble, is very pretty, wears well, and the mattress I bought for it (Sealy Naturalis Crib Mattress with Organic Cotton) fit perfectly.I love that it comes with a toddler rail and has adjustable heights for the mattress.Would definitely buy it again (and have recommended it to others).Update 12/2010Still love this crib.In fact, just bought another for baby #2 because our daughter's has held up so well (and adapted so wonderfully to her rapid growth).My only complaint: it takes forever - and I do mean forever - to remove all the damn safety labels from the sides of this crib.Though it took some time to put together, after we were done, the crib looks beautiful!It is really sturdy wood, and the espresso finish is great.I highly recommend this crib!I purchased this for my grandaughter's visits.Crib was easy to put together, if you are careful it doesn't scratch.Looks beautiful in the room, is very sturdy and my grandaughter sleeps great in it.I love this crib it is beautiful and sturdy.I bought it because it will be able to convert to a bed further down the road which is great because I have something that can grow with my child.The wood doesn't scratch all that easily unless you are constantly rubbing sharp objests against it, the instruction were easy to followI have a baby 4 months old and asked many of my friends what crip I should buy.After a long period of searching here and there, and considerations, I decided to get this item.The conclusion is that this item is fully satisfying my expection and more over.Very sturdy and hard in its frame, the crip also shows a luxurious look.My wife urged me ordered other item(diaper changing table) from the crip manufacturer, so I ordered one yesterday!It took about 30 minutes to assembly it.I had a lot of fun to do that.Only using it for a newborn at this point so time will tell on additional options.I own other convertible cribs for my other children(older now) however and they have lasted much abuse.-I'd say the color is pretty true to the photo, it's not really an espresso.-Assembly was great, easy, instructions are incredibly user friendly.-Packaged better than any furniture/product I've ever bought.It(the box) arrived destroyed, but the item was still flawless because of their packaging.The crib took a while to be delivered...the delivery date kept getting changed but we were very pleased when it arrived.It's a gorgeous crib, the finish is very nice and it seems very sturdy (my husband put it through the shake test.)We got the MDB Twilight Crib Mattress to go with it and it fits nice and snug.A baby would have to be super strong to get in between the mattress and the crib.So far we love the crib and our son seems to sleep well in it.We get a lot of compliments on it.The only thing I'm not sure I like is that you can see all the hardware.I might get some...after we convert it to a full bed later on.We recieved our crib really fast!We are pleased with everything about the crib.I was nervous about it scratching easily like everyone kept complaining about We put it together and managed to do it without scraching it at all!!We purchased the Serta Nightstar Extra Firm Crib Mattress.It fits perfect in the crib and it is firm just like we were hoping.WE are very happy!My husband and I got the package in this past weekend and put together the crib on Sunday in about 1 hour...we thought the instructions were fine and it was very simple to put together.The espresso color is beautiful and we're very glad we picked it.I'm not sure if we were more careful than others when putting it together but we also didn't get any scratches on it...so not sure if the complaints of easy scratching are valid.I agonized over choosing a crib for our new baby.I would say the color ended up being more like the espresso color pictured when the crib showed up.The crib came in perfect condition save one little scratch that was on the inside of the back leg.Kudos to the company for packing the crib so well!!The sleigh part of the crib does lend some difficulty to attatching items to the crib ie.It wouldn't say it's a 2 person job but it definitely helps having a second set of hands there to hold up the pieces.Overall we are extremely pleased with our purchase and if I had to make the decision all over again I would definitely choose this crib again.We were careful when we assembled it, but still managed to scratch it once.The scratch is on the top rail, but I covered it with a crib rail protector so we can't see it (the crib rail protector is by Trend Lab if you're interested).As far as the condition of the crib goes - our crib arrived in great condition.The pieces all looked and felt solid.The instructions were ok, but I had to go through them carefully.I'd suggest taking out the hardware and separating the items there before starting to assemble the crib.Unless you have extra wide doorways you will have to assemble the crib in the room where you want it.Our nursery is small with other furniture already in place, so we staged all the parts in the living room and brought the partially assembled pieces into the nursery.Fully assembled, the crib is solid and does not wobble at all.Bottom line is my husband really likes the crib, it has a nice style, and we are both confident that it is safe for our baby.I also like the fact that the crib can convert to a toddler bed (rail included).Other cribs considered: Graco Shelby, Baby's Dream Serenity and CocoonI shopped around for quite a while and I finally settled on this crib.It arrived within 2 days and was in perfect condition.The wood is beautiful (we bought the espresso finish).I can already tell that the finish will be sensitive to scratching and dings.Otherwise it is very sturdy and fits a standard crib mattress.We got the Colgate Classica I and it is a perfect fit!We also bought the matching changer.Someone stated there aren't any English directions, which isn't true, there are English and then written under the English is French.Also, I was so worried about scratches, it is pine people, which is the softest wood out there, I dropped a leg of it on concrete on accident and no dings and no scratches.I took my fingernail to a hidden area and nope, no scratches, I'm sure our son might nick it once he gets a tooth, but that would be about it.I'm looking forward to using this once our son is born.I gave it 4 because he isn't here yet and there was a TINY bit of misalignment but it was only noticeable to me since I put it together.Update :  I've now had  this 2.5 years and still hardly any scratches, only from me moving it.I bought this crib in black.i am so happy with it.it does "dent" and chip somewhat easily, but i will keep the black sharpie nearby.it is very sturdy.i will say that our baby isn't here yet, so this review is not based on daily use or having used with a baby yet.Bought this in summer 2009 for my first baby.It looks very nice in her room and we've received alot of compliments.It was relatively easy to put together and it nice quality and should last for years to come.I was warned by friends to make sure I got rails as they frequently discontinue crib styles and finding the rails later on would be difficult.For the price I paid I am totally satisfied and would get the crib again.My daughter is 2.5 and puts her crib through alot daily including using it as a trampoline.Quality is superior.Highly recommend.We got it as a set and at a good deal,It survived my daughter climbing it, doing pull-ups on it, and learning to open and slam a drawer.I like the drawer and I like DaVinci items in general.I bought this DaVinci Dresser/Changer in cherry, after reading every review I could find, about this and other comparable dressers and changing tables over and over to find the best one.I must say, I'm really happy with it.I bought it with the 4-1 emily crib both for 490$ at [...].I recieved them in perfect condition.My husband put it together by himself in about 2 hours, I watched, if you just follow the instructions even if it doesn't seem to make sense at first, you'll be fine.I'm using it now for almost 4 months, and it's great.it's higher than most other changingtables, which is good for your back( I'm 1.63m tall), the rails give some extra protaction agains rolling off.The changingpad seems perhaps thin in comparrison with the regular ones, but it is thick enough and feels comfortable.You don't need to buy another pad.My babygirl really loves laying on it.She often falls asleep while I'm changing her or clipping her nails or something.The drawers are sliding smooth, and hold up diapers, cloths, blankets, towels.it's just perfect.ofcours you shouldn't open the drawers using one nob( like I often do) because the the drawer slides a bit square and it scrathes the dresser.If you asemble it right it is very sturdy, even though it's not completely made of wood.I still love the dresser.It's still beautifull, I noticed that the bottom of the drawers are a bit bend in the centre, but I really put alot in them, and it doesn't effect the functionality.I noticed that most changing pads are a lot shorter than this one and I am really happy with mine.My girl still fits on it with room to spare for things like babyoil etc.My dad and brother assembled this beautiful crib for me just a few days after my son was born and they said it was a breeze to put together.We'll see how it fares over the next couple of years, but so far so good.My son is too young to have an opinion yet.So far I'm very happy with it.Update, 12/2010: We've been using the crib for over a year now and it's still awesome.Still very happy with this purchase.I purchased this crib after researching the Consumer Reports research on cribs.This particular crib earned CR selection as RECOMMENDED, which definitely got my attention as they tested every aspect of it for safety and usefulness.Million Dollar Baby (The Manufacturer) takes fair measures to protect the item while shipping.My personal experience was that some of the parts came in scratched or cracked.I couldn't wait anymore so I decided to use the less scratched part since my baby boy was about to be born and I wanted everything to be ready.As far as construction goes, this crib seems pretty sturdy (if you install it correctly).I love the fact that this crib can be used by your baby basically all his life living in your house, as it can change to a full size bed!It comes with all the parts needed for use as a crib and toddler bed; for the full size bed you have to buy the conversion rail kit which sells for around $90 here on Amazon.I like the fact that an Entity as Consumer Reports backs it up, because they test every item to the fullest extent possible in every possible aspect; so if they recommend it, that gives me peace of mind that the item should be safe and good quality (although as a responsible parent you should always keep a watchful eye and check everything twice).Recommended.I bought this crib because of its great reviews on Consumer Reports and got the matching mattress because I figured that because they match there won't be a fit issue.I wrote an email to the company and showed them photos of this gap.Well, my husband I put it together to discover (gasp!)I have to admit, Million Dollar Baby did a great job with customer service.They had FedEx pick up the crib they sent over.She slept in it sinds day one.It's beautiful, very sturdy, came in perfect state..but now it has a few scrates(mostely form a belt).It's easy to setup if you just follow the instructions, my boyfriend did it on his own in about 1 hour, I sat and watched...was 37 weeks pregnant.it weigh alot, but still is very easy to move arround when you need to clean.so if you like the looks... buy it..it's worth it.good furniture.my girl is now 21 months, still sleeps very well in her crib.I still am very happy with my purches.A great crib.We noticed some issues with the (white) finish on one leg being scratched/stained, but since that bit faces the wall and it was such a great buy, it's not an issue for us.Once MDB responded (about a week after my first email), it took over a week to resolve, and at least another week before the parts were actually delivered.I'd hesitate before ordering another one of these products, at least until MDB improves (or expand) its customer service department.Purchased this crib for our first baby in June 2010.The baby will be here in September, so we haven't had a chance to try it out yet, however, the first impressions are very good.The crib is sturdy, took us about 30 mins to set it up and it was very easy.The crib is a lighter color than what is portrayed in the picture (it is not much honey), but I'm okay with that.Also we bought a Sealy mattress with this and it fit perfectly within the safe guidelines.The rails also are close together, and fit the safety guidelines set by the AAP.I think that any kind of full size rail should work because you're working with a headboard and a footboard...but that's just my opinion - I haven't done any research in it.Looks like a very safe crib though...I guess time will tell how sturdy it is.It is still sturdy and works great, no problems with it.The only thing I don't like is that the crib is really deep and because I'm short I have to bend to get the baby there and sometimes he will wake up.I'm 5.3 and definitely need some height adjustment in order to get him in his crib peacefully.We are very happy with this crib .It is sturdy, seems to be well made, and easy enough to put together.I love that it comes with the toddler rail, that it received such high marks in safety from Consumer Reports, that it has multiple mattress-height settings and,  that it is not a dropside (which we thought would be a safety concern)We bought theColgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, Whitemattress which is an excellent fit.We bought the oak-color... not as orange-y as other reviewers said, but not quite a real oak wood color.It has not really scratched, so i wonder if its just the painted cribs that are a problem.TheFisher-Price Rainforest Peek-A-Boo Leaves Musical Mobilefits well on it - but only on the side that's closer to you (not the wall)Its not so easy to change the mattress height - I know some people can pull and re-snap the mattresses into new heights... but for this crib, you have to actually pull out the  mattress, unscrew some bolts, then re-screw them in a different position... it's a more involved process.The design is nice, but I like the Davinci KAlani better...But its an awesome crib and you can't beat the price.UPDATE: Spoke too soon... there is now a fairly large scratch on the bar on the front of the crib... but it is not as noticeable as it would be on a painted crib....I guess you have to be comfortable with the fact taht the crib may scratch.This is a very sturdy and good looking crib for a very reasonable price.We haven't done any of the conversions at this point, but even if we never use anything but the crib setting itself we love it!Assembly was pretty simple for anyone who has done prefab furniture before, nothing scratched, missing etc.It is much more solid "feeling" than we anticipated and everyone who has seen it comments on how beautiful it is.Definitely (as with most beds and cribs) I would put a dust ruffle on as there is some hardware that isn't necessarily easy on the eyes without it.This is a sturdy enough changing table and only took about an hour to assemble alone, the last part being the hardest.At three and a half months, my son wiggles quite a bit even while strapped down on the table.If you are not super careful and aware of this issue you risk banging your child's feet and hands against the wood when you go to raise them to wipe their hiney or remove them from the surface.Also, the included changing mat is quite thin and I've had to supplement it by laying some foam underneath it.In retrospect I wish I'd paid a little more $ for a table with an enclosed changing area.I bought the DaVinci Crib shown in the picture.After three days of searching for a nice changer, my wife and I decided to get the item.The conclusion is "Good buy,especially with the crip of the same manufacturer.The tiny holes were the important thing because it decided which horizontal bars would go in up or down position.Secondly, the upper panel used for changing is very fragile, so it comes with additional supporting parts(a metal frame and a belt-like supporter).With them, there will be no accident such as collasping while changing the diapers.But, someone may feel unstable and worried that the changer panel will break ONE DAY.I wish the manufacturer offer more sturdy panels.If it's hard for the maker to supply three sturdy panels, it would be good only for the diaper changing one.And, when you try to assembly this item, take extra caution not to break the panels.Bought it because my baby hated tummy time.A regular activity mat & a rolled blanket would've been just as good I think.The mat seemed a bit small when my daughter was 6 months old.It's a nicely made mat & mini boppy pillow but we didn't use it much.I probably wouldn't buy it again if I had the chance to do it againMy son loved this teether but, when in a defrosted state (after being chewed on for quite some time) we noticed the goo was leaking out.Really unacceptable!!These sleep sacks are wonderful!We have tried the Swaddle Me, the Swaddle Blanket, and the Miracle Blanket.The ONLY one our daughter AND son did not break out of was the Miracle Blanket ( she is now 5 1/2, he 3 1/2 - they each used it for about 3 months).ADVANTAGES* Works differently than others - holds arms at side with two "flaps" that tuck under the body (uses body weight), and then a longer piece wraps around the baby.The end result is a very tight but comfortable looking cocoon that works!* Keeps them warm with nothing else required.DISADVANTAGES* The part that swaddles the bottom half of the body sometimes come loose - you have to make sure that you wrap the blanket around the lower half o the body REALLY well!* Nothing else we can think ofWe are aware of other blankets on the market, but honestly haven't read a review or heard a testimonial from a friend to change our reco.We still get this as a gift!The Miracle Blanket does work.So yes, it is effective in keeping your baby from working himself out of the swaddle.But I've found that it's just as effective, and easier, to swaddle in the traditional way, using a regular blanket.The trick to getting a snug swaddle is to use a blanket that's larger than your typical receiving blanket (usually 30"x30"), and also to look for some stretch in the fabric.Another popular choice isaden + anais 100% Cotton Muslin Swaddle Wrap, 2 Pack, which is large (47"x47"), has some stretch, and the breathable fabric keeps the baby from overheating.Advantages of using a regular blanket is that they are usually more affordable so you can have a few in the laundry rotation, and they can be used for many other things beyond the swaddling stage, unlike the Miracle Blanket.This was such an incredibly important baby item for us.My son would only sleep while being held AND in motion for the first two months of his life.Swaddling my son in the Miracle Blanket sometimes provided the only way to get our son to stop crying -- and it was wonderful to have a soothing tool that both my husband and I had equal success with.This blanket was in every way superior to receiving blankets and less-expensive swaddlers, at least in terms of soothing power for my son.My son benefited from the Miracle Blanket until he was 10 months old!But for eight solid months, he spent almost all his sleeping hours swaddled in the Miracle Blanket.It's still perfectly good.I have friends who say it's essential to have more than one, but at $30 a blanket, we were fine with just one.For those parents with children who are able to get out of the blanket, I have a few recommendations (other than just swaddling tightly).And when my son got really big and was strong enough to wiggle out (maybe at 8 months old), we swaddled his arms in the Miracle Blanket then zipped aThe Original Woombie Cocoon Swaddle (Preemie (3-6 lbs), Avocado)(Mega Baby size!)We "weaned" my son from swaddling (when he was ready and clearly didn't need it anymore) by gradually loosening the tightness of the Miracle Blanket, but still zipping the Woobie around him -- I felt he was safer this way, though I have friends who did not think this measure was necessary.My son is now done with all of it!So I have no worries that this created any bad habits or dependencies for him.The Miracle Blanket was an essential item for us for the better part of my son's life so far.My only regret is that we didn't use it sooner.We received it as a gift before my son was born, but my husband and I weren't sure about "straightjacketing" the baby and didn't really do much with it until my son was about 6 weeks old.Now, though, I look back and recognize that my son's sleeping improved the more we used the Miracle Blanket.If we're fortunate enough to have another baby, we will probably use a Miracle Blanket right from the beginning!I wholeheartedly recommend this, and am so thankful to the experienced parents who got this for us as a baby gift.One more recommendation: AWubbanub Infant Pacifier - Lion with satin mane.Awesome!I wish all the best to every new parent out there... and to every new parent of a fussy and/or colicky baby.This was such an essential item for us.The miracle blanket was a bit pricey, but was an EXCELLENT swaddling blanket.A must for new parents.As a working couple...that was priceless.The miracle blanket is an absolute miracle!Every one should know about this awesome blanket!I don't like this swaddling blanket since I have to move my baby around (lift back especially) several times to put this on.Another time for the right flap so it is tucked under the baby's back.I don't like this at all.I prefer a quick, simple solution such as the Halo Swaddle Blanket or Summer Infant Swaddlepod.We have many blankets for swaddling and the Miracle Blanket, while pricey is totally worth it for convenience and effectiveness.We have tried swaddling with Aden and Anais and other blankets but our little one can struggle and get out of the swaddle no matter how tight we swaddle her.With the miracle blanket, the extra pieces of fabric make it a lot harder for the baby to get out of a swaddle.I bought three more and this is our first choice when we need to swaddle our baby!i'd almost recommend buying the medium size right away.he did stay swaddled and slept very well those first weeks which was a relief.The Miracle Blanket has a great concept and if I had to choose between one and a regular receiving blanket, I would happily pay the extra money for the miracle blanket.However, there are some great competing brands on the market that offer cheaper, better swaddling blankets.This is far outweighed by a less practical design and a price that's triple the current amazon price for the kiddopotamus.The miracle blanket requires that you tuck flaps over each arm of your baby and then under their back.Also the velcro on the kiddopotamus makes getting the perfect tension quick and easy.The miracle blanket has a very long wrap that you must go around and around your baby with...and without the velcro it is much more likely to come loose.Miracle blanket makes the velcro seem like a negative, but the velcro on the kiddopotamus isn't in any place that would rub up against your babies skin.As for fit, the kiddopotamus does a far superior job with my 7 lbs.19.5" baby girl.The miracle blanket is "one size fits all," whereas the kiddopotamus comes in both small and large.The size also seems perfect for any baby from 18 to 24 inches and 6 to 12 lbs., but don't take my word or it.I think this is a wonderful idea.However, it did not work for us.It felt like linen or canvas to me.It would probably be great for babies who don't move too much yet, maybe under 3months old.I LOVE miracle blankets.Most of all, they allow ANYONE to swaddle--even someone like me who never got the hang of using square blankets.I only ended up using it about 5 times.I don't see how it's any better than a regular swaddling blanket.In fact, I prefer the regular (35x35) swaddling blankets by Carters (around $10 for a pack of 2).They are soft, stretchy & lightweight (so baby doesn't sweat).I think I read that some people had babies who wiggled their way out of normal blankets so they really liked this, but that's never happened with my baby.The miracle blanket is great though!We found it no more difficult than wrapping him in a traditional blanket, and we are able to change his diaper at night without unwrapping him.I SO wanted to give this 5 stars and say "It truly is a miracle...my baby slept through the night!"My daughter used this blanket until she was 3-months and started to fight the swaddle so much that she could no longer sleep in it.I would definitely recommend this to new parents and suggest that they swaddle from day 1.This blanket makes swaddling easy and my baby sleeps great in it!It is a nice, soft, sturdy fabric with just the right amount of give and the pink is a nice baby pink.But we are still using the miracle blanket without swaddling her legs and she is sleeping just as well.Highly recommend this blanket!I read all the good reviews and bought this miracle blanket for my 8 weeks baby.I don't know why others like it so much, but it did not work for me.This blanket only works when our baby is already nodding off and ready to sleep.This swaddle blanket is indeed a miracle - it really holds!So easy to use, pretty much foolproof (watch the video online to help you get started).Keeps baby tight and warm and ASLEEP (we started using it the night he was born and he's slept through the night since)!One small downside (if you can call it a downside at all): Our son is a big kicker/mover while sleeping and every once in awhile manages to kick one of his legs out the bottom, but it doesn't seem to phase him or interrupt his sleep.Will definitely be giving this as a gift at every baby shower from now on!:-)2) The design (no velcro) is great b/c it doesn't get tangled up on clothes, baby skin, laundry etc.Huge advantage over the Halo & Summer Infant brands3) Material is light weight & cool enough to be used year roundCons:1) The dimensions of this aren't any longer than the Newborn Halo or Small Summer Infant sack!!I used these kind of blankets with my daughter who is 4 now.My child loved this blanket and I used it for about 4 months until she got strong enough to wiggle out of it at night.I ordered two more for my son.They like to shrink a bit.This blanket is so soft and keeps my baby feeling secure.Only one is necessary because it adjusts with your baby's growth.It works well, but needs to have a few things to make it perfect.I think the arm parts need something a little extra to keep the arms more down, maybe a button or a velcro connection.Our Baby loves this Bunny, its great.Soft , lightweight you can tie a binkie to it.Washes easily and drys well in the dryer.Under the Nile has excellent items for babies.Washes really well.We're very happy with this little bunny head.We got the sage color and it's a beautiful soft green.I will be looking in to purchasing more things from Under the Nile; very happy and thank you.This seems like such a great toy...... until you try to wash and dry it.I thought my baby girl would think this toy is cool - with all the grapes to touch and feel.She doesn't even give it a second of her time.My 7 month old loves this thing and loves chewing on it.We have now moved on and have Mr Banana and Mr Carrot as well.He loves them all.The only thing I have to complain about the way it's made is that they sewed a leaf on the front under the face, and the leaves all around head tend to curl up...the leaf in front, curls up right over the face, blocking it.Ah well, not a huge deal or anything.Unfortunately, as much I as I think it is awesome, baby has very rarely played with it and did not chew on it while teething (although I didn't try the freezing thing I just now read from other review).When my husband picked this out for our 13.5 month old twins, I was skeptical, especially after some of the reviews, but we opted to give it a try.This seemed to fit the bill.Taking it out of the box, it was preassembled, which was nice, and very lightweight.So, it was very easy.They didnt try to climb it and, when it teetered, they backed away.I was hoping to let them both play in it, but it is just too tiny.It's no bigger than a playpen, although the walls are higher.They are made such that you can link them together.So, that will give us a decent size play area that is fully contained.While we havent used this feature yet (and hence I can't rate our experience thus far), it was one of the things that led us to selecting this item.This pen WAS great.My little boy who is 17 months old got this around Xmas time last year.We were using it and it was working great.Thankfully, I found them, not my baby boy.We used this bath from day 1 (er, well whenever she got her first bath at home anyway), and it's been awesome.My baby is 6 months and petite (25th percentile, so not a large kid), and she has outgrown it.We used the Cleanwater Infant Tub until Leighton was over five months old and I think it's quite lovely.For $39.95, it's a bargain compared to a few pricier tubs we tried.It reads the water temp and allows a constant stream of clean water.I registered for it and received it as a shower gift.I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because the construction is rather crude.I  am very pleased with this 4moms bath tub.There are multiple drain's which so far have worked perfectly.My daughter is 3 months; and the tub is recommended 0-6 months.I absolutely love the thermometer and the clean water system in this tub.Sure, anyone can bath a baby in any type of bucket, tub or container.A thermomer makes it easy to keep that comfy bath and not constantly check the water... its definately an extra visual aid and it changes color.. water is cold (blue), warm (green) or hot (red).The clean flow system definately helps keep babies water clean but constantly creating that flow of fresh water in one area, dumping to baby area, and then out.. and it does make a difference.The last I used for her first 2 months but wasn't fully pleased with it, but it did its job.All in all, this ones a keeper for me and I am pleased.This is a great tub and makes bathing my baby very easy.My only complaint would be that it is difficult to bath newborns.Overall a fantastic tub!We bought this bathtub for our son and started using it when he was just a few weeks old.It is a nice tub - I like that its designed for the water to continue flowing through it during the bath.I hated this gate, I could never get it tight enough in a doorway for it to be any use at all.But then I figured it out.What you need to do to get it tight in a doorway is to separate the two wooden bars where it says "open close".I love this changing pad!I am using it for over a month and so far i am in love with this item!Having tried both the 2-sided changing pad and this 4-sided one, I think this 4-sided one wins me over.This 4-sided pad is longer than usual, but still fits most changers and changing covers.I had the 3-sided for my first son, but like this one a lot better.if your shower pull knob is far back on the spout, closer to the wall, this one won't work for you.i love this!i have a cat that will not stay out of the tub because he loves to play with the faucet and this drives me nuts!i love it!my daughter loves it so much too!I have a larger faucet so it was awkward at first and the water was leaking out of the back of it, but after moving it around a bit and got a better grip/seal on the faucet with it, it works just fine now!i never have to remove it unless i'm cleaning it.it's great and never in the way and looks great in my bathroom.So far i actually have enjoyed it because it creates a nice water fall and had a bubble dispenser too!They have all sorts of unique designs and with a little bit of water, the kids can cling them to the shower walls.Otherwise, they float in the tub.They dry fairly easily too.My son's favorite are the balls!I love these!I thought they were a great alternative to the typical alphabet foamies used in the bath.I was a bit concerned about the balls as I had read that they once contained PVC.They're made out of a type of PVC which has been tested for all of the dangerous phthalates as called out by California and other state laws.Our daughter has been using these for the last two years now!However it was given to family, so they would have told me if there was somthing unsafe.He now seems MUCH more comfortable in this Boon Flair, and it's so easy to clean (over and over and over and over), very few nooks and crannies to gunk up, and it works easily into our small kitchen lives, and he is able to sit more upright like a real chair and it fits right up to our table.He's much more a "part" of our family meals now than when he was in the monstrous plastic graco we had before.But it turns out that this Boon Flair chair works great, in my book, to get my kid right up to the table -- the adjustable height makes it easy to either position him to fit with the table, with or without his tray.2) the pneumatic adjustment still takes a bit of manual force to get it up/down.Nothing herculean, but I did think it would only take a light tap to the orange button to adjust, and that is not the case.Not a happy day!So...from someone who is expecting baby number six let me give you the condensed version.Pros:I like the design, I actually have a country/cottage style house but the chair fits.Tray is small so trains them to eat with mannersEASY TO CLEANRolls around easily.Love the dishwasher trays.Easy to put together.Cons:Seat does not have a recline.Thus she is able to stand up in her chair.The lock will not stop rolling on tile or hardwood and I don't know that many kitchens/dining rooms with carpet.The white seat stained on the very first meal.I tried the magic eraser and that didn't work either.I will be ordering a darker seat.Overall we are happy with this seat and would recommend.For $20, I expected more than what I received with this photo album.The photo pages are decent.But, on a few, the separators between photos had come loose and it did not hold the photographs in place very well.Overall, I think you'd do better buying photo albums at Kohls, Target, etc.As it stands, this one is not worth the price.Great photo book.Love the windows on the outside and the personalization options.This album is super chic and stylish.Nothing special just a cute photo album where you can put a pic in the front page.I love this baby book!It has all the fill in the blanks you will need: baby's family tree, parents' info, pop culture, news headlines, prices of things, miletones, growth chart etc... the only thing it does not have are envelopes for keepsakes.I even bought one for my friend's babyshower!It just seemed like a lot of extra work with the photo corners that you need to put on each picture.Finally, was able to return it and theY took a percentage off for restocking !I read all the reviews for this baby book and was somewhat hopeful it wouldn't be the typical cutesy over done baby books you see out there.I wanted something I could place pictures in as well as record milestones and events.I'm a diehard scrapbooker and this was a little much for me considering what "themed" pages were on the right hand side.I was more than willing to work with those pages adding color and pictures at my own discretion.I returned the book because when it's your baby you want to make a note of every little thing and their weren't enough "topic" pages with enough variety for me to accomplish this.All the pages are a solid cream color.There is a place to write when or if you found out the gender of the baby, and how you felt.There is one for the baby shower.There's a page for the baby's family tree up to his/her great grandparents.One page is for the day baby is born.There is a page for baby's firsts.There are spots for birthdays for the first few years.I'm not sure what it would take for me to give it all five stars, but it just didn't make me flip with excitement.It feels very warm which is a plus since you will obviously use it on winter, and so far it has worked well for my baby.My only complaint, as I stated before, would be the size of the opening for the head, quite small and the reason for the three stars.Apart from that, the item is good quality and seems durable.However, the quality is excellent and this hat is super warm and will hold up very well, I can tell already.Great quality, I recommend it!Wanted a cute, warm hat for winter - this is it!It's a little big now but by the time it gets really cold, it should be perfect!Great price too!Cute warm hat, very small.Was snug on my small 3-month old.I ended u using the iplay hat, which also covers his ears.very cute hat- and warm.my son is 3 months old and already grew out of the 0-6 mos size about a week ago.I should have paid closer attention to the reviews that said this hat was very small.I bought it when my baby was just past 3 months old.She is small for her age (25% percentile on the growth charts), and the 0-6 month size hat is very tight on her.Another reviewer gave the instructions on how to remove the elastic, which gives the hat more give.This hat is very nicely made though, and very cute for either a boy or girl.I use this Munchkin organizer with thePrince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmerand it fits great right on top in a very convenient place.The pocketed diaper middle section is great!It's tricky to "restock" it, but the fact that the diapers do not tip out more than makes up for it!I use it for lightweight items because everything else kept falling out and/ or caused the velcro straps to come undone.I found it at Target for $4 and it helps to keep baby's nursery organized but it is temporary.This was nice to have for certain foods but some of the foods did not grind very well not really sure why, I might have been doing something wrong at certain times.Thought it would make food prep for baby easier then getting then little blender out, but it did not, just as many things to clean and takes more man power to use.It is nice for when we go to resturants though.These work great for larger snacks like dried fruit (not raisins!I only put in small snacks when I'm doling them out, and larger snacks for him to help himself.My son likes to turn his cup upside down, and this keeps the snacks inside when turned over.All in all, it's more useful than anything else I've found for allowing my son to snack without always getting his food everywhere.Great idea, but my toddler manages to still dump all the food out of these.I don't know if others haven't tried other snack cups but these aren't that great at all.These snack catchers are awesome.Started using these with 15 month old twins, they took to them easily.I tried it, but not road tested it:)Now at 20 months old they haven't succeeded at taking the lid off.These are great for distraction-type snacks in our jogging stroller since it has no snack tray.I worry that repeated removal of the lid will stretch it so the child will be able to remove it easily, so I don't take it off unless I have to - I just shove food in through the slits.Not a huge deal though.One of my girls hates to ride in a stroller (she likes to ride on my back) but sometimes she has to - this helps a lot.I have these for my 2 year old and they are wonderful!He's oddly gentle with everything, and didn't like having his hand in the cup with the lid around his wrist.However, depending on what kind of snack you have in there, some will stick to your child's hand and go flying everywhere during the course of snack time.It can also fall from a stroller, and keep most of the food safely inside, and clean.Overall, these work well and are the best option I've found.I put my 1-year old's favorite puffs in there and it will keep him occupied for at least 15 minutes (depending on how much I put in the bowl and how hungry he is).Perfect when we're out at a restaurant and want to keep him occupied while we eat.Somewhere I read that these toys are watertight, but it's not true.As for the other two, once the water gets in, you may never get it out (just hope your kid doesn't suck on them.....eeuuuuw!)I have twin boys that are 4 months old who loves lights and sounds.Since we do have twins, I am quite picky on what I buy for them.Anytime I swirl it to find other foods it drops to another level.This was an excellent infant tub.I was so worried at first to wash my baby perfectly and this tub allowed me to do so, while allowing comfort to my baby.We used this tub for quite a while, until she was ready to transition to a full grown-up tub.We really love this tub.The tub is large and comfortable and the compartment on the side is great for holding the washcloth.I've used this tub for three months now and love it.Plus, it was not very sturdy to hold my son up because he kept slipping down on the tubular bottom.I found that I needed to use two hands to keep him safe in the tub, therefore had troubles washing him because I could not hold him sturdy with one hand and wash him with the other.With the First Years Sure Comfort Newborn to Toddler Tub, my son is able to be supported and have a great time splashing away.I would highly recommend using this tub for its sturdiness and ease of use.I really can't rate this item, per se, because my grandson hasn't arrived yet.I researched a lot of baby tubs prior to picking this one...I think it will be perfect for 'Gabby's' house visits.This way, I don't have to freak out about him touching every where.So, in terms of functionality, they do precisely what they are supposed to do: they create a slightly more significant barrier when accidents do happen.The training pants are essentially constructed like this: a jersey outer, with a terry cloth inner.In theory, these training pants should have 100% gentle to my daughter's skin.Is the terry inner material just irritating to really sensitive skin?But I'm more than a little peeved.My 27 lb daughter is almost too large for the 24- 31 lbs.size.My daughter has baby pudge still, but is not fat.They catch the pee and I like that the patterns can be used for boys or girls.First of all, when I read the ingredients on the package I went "yuck".The main tooth decay ingredient is Xylitol.It has all kinds of studies indicating that it can help tooth decay significantly and has no known toxicity issues.The sugar alcohol is derived from trees and seems very safe.This is important.My baby used a different paste and brush combo at first and she did not like; it was hard to use correctly with her constant squirming.She actually smiles and giggles when we use it, I think it tickles her little gums as we brush and she enjoys it.But it's really an awesome idea.This is a great toothpaste-- my 9-month-old loves it and she enjoys having her teeth brushed so much that she cries when I take the brush out of her mouth.The thing I hate about the fingertip brush is that my daughter (proud owner of 8 sharp teeth) likes to BITE down on my poor index finger inside the silicone sleeve.To remedy this, I try holding just the tip of the finger sleeve and gently let her chew away on it, but that poses a very dangerous hazard as she could potentially swallow it if I don't hold onto it with a very firm grip-- which is difficult to do with a wet, slippery piece of silicone.Keeping the toothpaste though, like I said, it's a great toothpaste.This lock did work at keeping her out (she was about 1 1/2 at the time) but it was loose fitting even though i installed it just as instructed.I don't know if others are better in that regard.Works but not exactly as well as advertised.This system ensures that the diapers do not smell.We loved it so much we bought one for upstairs, downstairs and for grandparent's houses.On another note-the Diaper Genie Elite works even better!I bought it based on recommendation of the baby bargain book.Here is what I love and don't love...Don't Love:Finicky design that can easily get off track and malfunction.Once we started with solid foods, we started double-bagging and taking the bag out immediately.Hands-free design makes use much easier.Overall good design at first but with use becomes flawed.However, I have a couple of issues with it.1) It's not easy to open one-handed.Originally I was going to get the same fridge lock, but then I came online and realized that I've only had this lock for about 12 months (not the 24 months I originally thought).I guess what is boils down to is: make this purchase with your eyes wide open.This bed didn't come in the best condition; some of the pieces had marks and scratches on it, but since it was already my second bed I ordered, I was just thankful it didnt arrive cracked and kept it.Was also easy to assemble, however it looks much larger than it actually is.We purchased this as a pet barrier to keep our female bichon/poodle from going up stairs and causing chaos.It was pretty simple to install.Just make sure to read the directions and follow closely and you will have a smooth installation.We originally had a gate that mounted with a pressure spring.It was fine but having to take it on and off was a pain.I thought it would have been just the gate and hinges but it is great that they included the screws as well.With the plastic anchors it is tight again.For $13.50 from Amazon, you can't beat this item.(If drywall, I'd highly recommend you pick up some anchors, since this doesn't come with any.)I mean the baby would have to be super strong just to get his hand in between.It is nice and firm, but soft enough to be comfortable.It's a very nice mattress...a bit pricey but all crib mattresses are like that.We're happy with our purchase.We've had this crib and mattress for about a year now.It's been slept on much much more than the Twilight mattress has and it's still holding up very well.This dresser was hands-down the easiest furniture assembly I've done in the past several years.All the parts (screws, etc.)I would highly recommend this dresser!These work exactly as advertised; however, they allow the door to open enough that my 9 month old can get his fingers pinched in the drawer or door.And he does pinch his fingers all the time!I switched to the magnetic style lock so that he can't get the door open at all.Just an adorable baby blanket.We used the Kiddopotamus swaddle for real swaddling, but this has been a wonderful baby blanket.We have loved it!I bought it because of its size and don't regret.The blanket is very soft and very big.This is a great swaddling blanket.I love the chic designs and it's large enough to completely swaddle your newborn, unlike the receiving blankets available at the stores.However, because of the flannel material it does make your baby hot and sweaty, I wish the manufacturers would take different climates into consideration and make a "summertime" one.This is a great safety item for any home with small children!It is both functional and, dare I say, attractive with the right color/brick combo.It provides a great peace of mind that a slip near the hearth won't turn into an ER visit with x-rays and stitches.It is held onto the hearth with double-sided tape and I have read on other sites that reviewers have listed this as a major drawback.And I must admit that my 4 year old can pull it off if he tries.The simple solution there is, of course, to teach him not to do it!Even my 16 month old has figured out that it is a no-no.So, I do not consider it a con at all.The waterproof fabric texture is more comfortable for baby than something like vinyl would be, and probably more durable too.Plus this design is gorgeous.We liked the smaller version of these bibs, and now that our son is eating more things and getting messier, the extra coverage because of more length is great in the supersized ones!This keeps our pants cleaner than before and we love that the bibs are made of safe materials!!What a great bib!Really does an awesome job at protecting your little one's clothes.It's very generously sized for my 16-month-old.It's very eco-friendly and easy to clean which makes this so easy to love.Does the job.You can just rinse the bib after use and air dry for the next use.I've purchased numerous bumkins bibs and they surely have held up with their quality and durability.Since this bib is so large it will make a tight squeeze.This bibs are really nice.But they do a great job and wash up nicely.The Dr Seuss theme is really cute.I love the Dr. Seuss designs on these Superbibs.Highly recommended.This was my 2nd bumkins bibs purchase, and these ones are a little bit thicker than the girly 3 pack version we first purchased.So easy to clean, and they actually catch a ton of food (vs. others with catchers that seem to miss food as it falls)These are nice bibs.I love bumkins bibs for their quality and durability.Less bib means less coverage but they do a great job otherwise.They are soooooo easy to clean.I bought several to have in rotation.(no PVC and very eco-friendly which is a huge + to me!)This is a wonderful Bib - it does a great job catching food that falls, preventing clothes from getting soiled, washes in seconds in the sink and dries in minutes, folds down very small for travel in a diaper bag, is easy to use and remove: a highly recommended bib.Highly recommended bib!This is one of several Keith Haring items I picked up for baby.These bibs are great!They are on the larger side, so they cover most of my son's shirt.They have a large velcro strip on the neck, for different size necks, expecially since my son had a small neck.They are very easy to use.So, the pocket dried in the open position and worked better.So, I bought a BabyBjorn bib and a Bibbity bib.The pocket of the bjorn bib is great and always stays open.However, because the pocket is so rigid, it clashes with the tray.The bjorn bib pocket kept getting caught under the countertop and then it would yank my son's neck.The pocket stays open pretty well.The pocket does work better than the Bumkins Superbib pockets.So, some food still ends up on the child's lap.I think the Bibbity bib works a little better than the Bumkins Superbib overall because the pocket catches more.It is just too uncomfortable.So, I bought 1 MORE bib.I bought the Bumkins sleeved bib.It was GREAT!This way I only had to buy one.In conclusion, I recommend the Bumkins sleeved bib for any baby who eats pureed food.When they start on finger food, the Bumkins Superbibs and the Bibbity bib are good.The Bibbity work a little better than the Bumkins Superbib but your child might think they are uncomfortable.It is too heavy and uncomfortable.I throw it in the wash every few days.Here is a link to the drying rack that I use.Mommy Genius Drying Rack--Dry or Display Just About Anything (Baby Bibs, Plastic or Reusable Food Storage Bags, Kitchen Dish Towels, Bathroom Hand Towels, Washcloths, Mugs, Sports Water Bottles, Herbs, Mittens, Children's Boots, Lingerie, Holiday Orname...These bibs are an absolute must have.If your baby is anything like ours, most of the food will most likely end up on these bibs when they first start on solids.Here's what we love about these bibs:-  Easy to clean (use a wet paper towel to wipe clean)-  Also machine washable-  Fabric is soft yet waterproof, and also very durable-  The bibs are adjustable (there's about a 2 inch long strip of velcro instead of the one size fits all bibs, allows you to keep the bib as tight or loose as you like-  The colorful designs are easily recognizable, so my son knows that when we put these bibs on, it's time to eatI love the Seuss motif, but more than that, the quality of the bib is great.Resists stains, can be rinsed in between a few feedings (if they're not horrendously messy!)and washes nicely in the machine.The Velcro seems sturdy and doesn't get all mangled and destroyed in the wash like some do.Nice!We've been using them daily for a couple of months.They catch most of the dribble, though some food chunks don't land in there as they might in a hard, plastic bib.We used these bibs for about 1 1/2 yrs, and for a while I thought they were pretty great.Oh, and the Baby Bjorn's pocket is self supported, so it's always propped out to catch the food!We love these bibs!!!I bought them three years ago with my second son, and they held up well enough to use now with our third son.I wish I had them with my first son.Besides working exactly as promised, and their easy clean-up, they are so much less bulky than other weatherproof bibs we've used (like those weird rubbery ones).I've bought these bibs for friends because they're so good.My son (now 5 months old) loves the funky creatures (we unlinked the stuffed toys for him to play with when he was younger) and enjoys chewing on the colorful links.This has been great for apples, squash and other vegis and fruit.Great idea, but my son hated it!He didn't like the mesh texture over his banana.I really like these mesh feeders.We've tried all the fresh food feeders available and this one is the best so far!OMG-baby loves this!Feeders are a great idea to introduce new flavors to babies without the risk of choking.You can also make cold "teethers" with frozen breastmilk.Highly recomended, just not this brand.I just started using these for my 5 month old daughters.One of them is extremely fussy lately (We think she is teething) This calms her down so fast and keep her occupied for a good 15 minutes.I have only put frozen homemade baby food in it so far.Haven't had any trouble cleaning it as some have stated, but then again, still only using frozen foods in it and I rinse it right away.easy to put chunks of frozen fruit or ice into.My 8 month old enjoys using both equally, and they've been great for teething and learning to self-feed without fear of choking.I prefer the other design over this Munchkin brand however, becuase the screw-off design of the other ones is easier to use than the pinch & open hinge design of these.She goes nuts when she sees me walking towards her with one of these in my hands and it keeps her occupied for a good hour.As the other reviewers have said, bananas are the messiest, but I just throw them in the dishwasher and they clean up real nicely.I have recommended these too all my friends that have infants/toddlers.This item will not dissapoint you!My son used his a couple times.the netting was a huge turn off to my daughter.the texture of the netting is not appetizing and would deter me to eat from it as well.My baby loves Sophie, but when sophie's not doing the trick this helps.I put frozen fruits inside and he loves it.My son did not like these also the netting came apart.These work well and are mostly easy to clean depending on what you feed them!These are great to pop an ice cube in for teething.It's a great way to introduce more solids to your child without the constant worry of choking.The food that does come out it very tricky to clean out once you are done and the mesh seems to get clogged.My 10-month old LOVES these feeders.I mostly put frozen pureed apple cubes in them for teething.I probably wouldn't try bananas or anything of that consistency just because it would be impossible to clean.Otherwise, you just throw them in the dishwasher and they come out perfect.I tried cold mango too, same results- 3 times through the dishwasher, soaking and scrubbing cannot remove all the food bits.And I'm not super paranoid about germs, but that just seems unsanitary.Not untill the design is revamped and I don't have to spend hours picking little banana bits out of the seams.Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves.I also bought the "Baby Safe Feeder" and that one has a screw top w/a removeable mesh liner.highly recommend.Love it, fits perfect, warm, soft, easy to install.I purchased several toothbrushes for my son in the past and this one is much better than any of them.My son is 10 months now and has 6 teeth, somehow he managed to bit off peaces of other toothbrushes, but not this one...he really enjoys it!My little girl just loves "brushing" her teeth with this.How could you not like a toothbrush that a baby asks to brush her teeth with several times a day?It would be nice if I could be sure it's doing a good job, but it's certainly better than nothing (or fighting a young child to "open up").It's chemical free and has tons of bristles all around and is perfectly squishy.My daughter hated having her teeth brushed.I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon.Also, do know you can't pick color.We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice.The heartbeat sound wasn't that great and the whale sound effect was just plain freaky sounding.I tried this sheep for two weeks but my son still doesn't like it.It works MUCH better.He likes the sound better and we can have it repeat the track as often as we want, unlike the sheep which turns itself off.I think this is more for parents who just want to buy something cute.We got this for our 3 month old at Christmas & he loves it!We have no complaints other than the sounds aren't exactly as they sound in the description.To us they sound more like someone breathing, a water feature, crickets on a summer's night, & a jungle groove over a campfire...LOL!But the freaky one of someone breathing holds him over until he is deeply asleep.I love the option of going longer than 20 minutes, at the 23 min timer he wakes up, but the 45 minute timer is perfect!I like that his giraffe is big & cuddly...so does he!This normal size one has a velcro loop so you can take it anywhere!The sound quality is excellent and they went above and beyond to include the timer switch and the volume control - awesome!3.It's every bit as cute and cuddly as the picture.The noise selections are great as is the timer option.Our newborn is sleeping in our room right now, and we even appreciated the noise.We like this so much, we would give it as a gift in a heartbeat.It is very soft and can even be used for new borns.I found this is a wonderful item to have for a new baby.There is not much that can provide comfort or sensory stimulation at such a young age.We used this with our daughter every day for the first two months of her life.It provided her comfort, especially the heartbeat sound.We never had to change them once.Its a great item and would be a lovely gift for any baby.I bought the first one when my twin granddaughters were born.Bought the second when we put them in separate rooms.But the quality of sound and the volume range of the Cloud B Sheep is superb.My only complaint is that you can't choose to let it run for 8 hours.You have to move it every time you turn the music on or off.**The on-the-go Sleep Sheep has the buttons on the side rather than the back, which is a perfect design.It has the same great features as the regular size but without the design flaw of button-location.It is just a little smaller in size.I love the Sleep Sheep.I usually put it on the "rain" or "ocean" sounds as the "whale" and "heartbeat" are kind of strange and not very soothing.It is especially useful when she gets up in the middle of the night to nurse and is still fairly sleepy.I do love the sleep sheep, the noises are very soothing and help to block out my family's noise when the baby is sleeeping.Nice addition to any nursery decor and not obtrusive to the eye.Nice to have the same object for her to look at and listen to so it's easy to fall a lseep in other places.We just choose the white noise.Works great on the 4 month old!Really relaxing sounds.Adorable and soft...I can see pulling out the sound pack and letting this become a cuddly favorite toy when he is a little older.Our 2 week old son LOVES this.We swaddle him up in a miracle blanket and turn this on.Of the four sounds, I think the heartbeat is most effective, followed by the waves, rain, then whales.I was given the Sleep Sheep when my son was born, and initially I wasn't too impressed.However, right around 8 months, the boy became extremely distractible and would wake up to small changes in his environment unless deeply asleep.This is when the Sleep Sheep became a real workhorse - 20 minutes of white noise was enough to get him to that deeper sleep level.By the time it shut off, he was out like a light.Since it has arrived, peace reigns once more.Praises:-The sheep is adorable.-The velcro strap to hold it onto the crib is some tough stuff.The little man can't even think about getting the thing off.-The volume adjustment is great.It can be quiet or loud, depending on the other household noises.-The controls on the back are very easily accessed.-No lights or anything that keep a child awake with visual cues.Complaints:-The heartbeat seems too slow.I would prefer it at 5,10,15... intervals.That would be very nice.Opinion:I like the sleep sheep.Unfortunately the Sleep Sheep we received had a defective sound box; when we turned the volume up toward the max, the sound would shut off.We loved the four different settings.The heart beat was wonderful at the beginning and now we've moved onto rain.The timer features are great and it looks adorable hanging on her crib.It has 4 great settings: flowing water, ocean waves, mom's heartbeat, and whale songs.I love the mom's heasrtbeat for my son.It really soothes him and keeps him relaxed when I put him down.I may have to by the travel size as well for when we visit family.My son loves this giraffe... the white noise and heartbeat help him go and stay asleep... the other sounds he becomes very content and aware.I love this item...This nursing cover has several really great features that make it worth the price.The ribbing at the top that allows you to peek down and see your baby is great -- the few times I've tried nursing with just a blanket over the baby, I have had a much harder time trying to get him started and if he pops off the boob, it is a struggle to get him back on.(I haven't really found a need to put anything in the pockets, as I would probably just drop whatever it is anyway.)This would be an amazing gift for a new mom who might not have considered that she would need one, or might not spend the little extra to get one with these extras.She loves it!Not to mention it's stylish!The print is so classy and my son even loves to bat at it while nursing!Very easy to use and washes well and dries quickly.The next strap is easy to adjust and the opening to see baby is perfect.It is definitely worth the price.An awesome, unique shower gift, also.All it is, is a piece of cloth with some wire.I have two types of BF-ing tents, but I almost only use this one because the fabric is wider and less heavy.Amongst my new mother friends, this is the only hootie hider (as one calls it) that they use.All told, it covers as needed, folds down nicely, and allows for easy baby viewing.With any BF-tent one should be aware of the following:~active, grabby baby (or as one lady calls it "Two cats fighting under a blanket")~it doesn't cover your back, so if you're out, always wear a loose fitting, front opening top/sweater of some sort so you're not all exposed on one side~THE WIND!I also like the fact that when I'm at some one else's house and baby falls asleep, he can have some dimmer lighting (less stim) under the tent.I can either keep him on his side or shift him up to my chest too.All told, a nice item to have and one that ladies I know who DIDN'T buy one wish they did.Although the color was a little different from what it looked like online (I ordered valencia), I am still very pleased with this purchase.This is a well made, high quality nursing cover, that seems to hold up well to washing (I wash on gentle though just in case).I received this as a gift from my registry so the price didn't really impact me.The designs are beautiful and bring a lot of compliments.The adjustable strap around the neck is nice so I don't feel like I am swimming in fabric.One of my favorite features is the terry cloth pads on the bottom corners that allow me to easily wipe up the milk dripping from her mouth when she pulls off with out having to dig around fast for her burp rag.It is generously sized.It also makes latching on properly a nearly impossible feat.It's also very much a challenge to get a blanket or towel positioned so she can see me but no one else can!It's better than a blanket or towel because it wraps around my neck, so that I can use both hands to hold my newborn without messing with it.Someone else would have to stand directly over me to get a peek, though - perfect.I like that I can see my baby easily, get good coverage for privacy and that she doesn't seem unhappy about being underneath it.Before I had this cover, I would use a receiving blanket tucked into my bra straps.My son would wiggle and pull down the blanket and I was mortified that I was going to show myself to the world when he did this.One of them is a very light colored fabric mostly white background with light grey and light blue (can't remember the fabric name), the other has a slightly darker more dense pattern (called Kimono).Washes well, and I do put it in the dryer on a light setting and use a warm iron occasionally.I nursed my son for 10 1/2 months total, and I don't think I would have gone for so long had I not had this awesome cover!I nursed baby#2 for 14 months with ease, anywhere and everywhere, again with confidence!The beach, church, restaurants, and even on a slow ride at Disneyworld.If I didn't have this cover I would never feel so bold!I love it and highly recommend it.I have never had anyone bat an eye at me while nursing under this.I gladly allowed photos to be taken of me nursing this time around with my cover.Wish I had more photos of me nursing my first.Highly recommended.I bought this (finally) before taking a trip with my 5 month old which involved flying.It worked great on the plane, in the airport, and also in restaurants.I just wish I had bought it 5 months sooner!I purchased this before my son was born and have used it extensively, each time I nurse around anyone besides family, since my son was born 6 1/2 months ago.I chose the chocolate color because I liked the color scheme and design, and my son seems to enjoy looking at it as well.I like being able to look at my son while he's breastfeeding and the adjustable loop around my neck is easy to adjust.My only complaint is that it isn't the best cover for a squirmy baby who likes to pull on the cover.I give it four stars, because sometimes it is hard to position it where I can see through the opening.I get compliments on it all the time.i bought this for my wife during the breastfeeding days.it was a permanent item in the diaper dude bag!I love this!I bought it after owning the baby bond which really wasn't as discreet as I wanted in very crowded settings i.e.This works very well and you can see your baby which is great.I bought this as a baby shower present, but I also own one.I love it!!!I just had twins and bought these bibs.Great price, great quality.Colors don't fade, fabric doesn't get rough and velcro is still working great (fyi, I make sure the bibs have the velcro piece together before I put them in the washer).It comes of many different colors, and comprises of terry cloth.After reading other customer reviews, THANK YOU, decided to go with large size; my grandson is 13 months old, 27 lbs and 32 inches tall, Tiger fits him great now and should last him a few years!The small size must really be for very tiny babies!?Sturdy and well balanced so it doesn't tip over easily; actually has to be pushed over on purpose.I've been watching these Wheelies for some time now and am happy they're making better choices for boys, this Tiger is ADORABLE with his stripes, fuzzy tail and ears!We love this toy but wish we would have gotten the larger one.My daughter is small so thought this size would be better but is too small for her to ride on but she loves to push it around the house.As with others, I debated on what size to get.I really would prefer to get something they will grow into more than something they will quickly out grow, so I bought the large.I bought the lady bug and the bumblebee for 14 month old boy/girl twins.They are now 18 months and both are beginning to make them go for short distances.They are holding up well.We're well out of the pack 'n play stage, but everywhere we go doesn't always have an extra bed for our little 3-year-old.That easy.That fast.)I am pleased with it and will continue to use it as we travel (can you say "go back to a King Size bed in the hotel?!The instructions clearly state no jumping (with reason), but my little boy couldn't resist.Wasn't sure if she'd like the tent feature of the pea pod plus.Slip it out of its carry bag (also a plus) and just pull it open.It will still have been well worth the $20!The 7 year old was much too big for it to lay down on but still liked to sit on it.Very pleased.Its excellent quality, and will surely be a part of our family for years.This blanket is sooo soft.Would have been nice to have the fuzzy fabric on both sides and just the satin on the edges.Washes well, just be sure not to wash it with any bibs or the bibs will snag it.This works perfectly on the round rail for theDaVinci Emily Convertible Baby Crib in CherryAnd chew he would!Besides the plastic ones weren't compatible with my crib anyway.He did finally figure out how to remove them, but by that time he was pretty much done chewing on it.After some careful examination my husband was able to close it back down to fit into the case.Otherwise we are extremely pleased and it will be perfect for our grandson.Now, it is a little garish, but at the same time I actually really like it-it's bright, sturdy, and is about  1 1/2 in.I like how the ends are solid, sometimes my 11 month old isn't exactly crazy about being in the playpen, but if she sees me walk away, it gets worse.as my pack and play, but as already stated, that wasn't important to me.Not much more exciting than that.Only the mirror got a "scratch" already, maybe I bent it to much :(and of course the satin white product label is the most interesting oneThe little tags are silky and provide a good tactile experience for baby.It also makes a nice soft musical sound when shaken.I wish the vibrating piece was easier for babies to pull, but my baby still loves this.My 9 month old son loves it for the car rides because of the tags and the chime sound it makes when you shake it.many different ways to grab it, and many different textures.nice rattle sound too.a little pricey but worth it.It is light enough for a infant to hold it over his/her head and the various tags make it a great tactile experience.I have a Baby Jogger City Double.Any one familiar with Baby Jogger will tell you they make awesome strollers, but rip you off on the accessories.It works well holding my travel coffee mug or my Kleen Kanteen.It was a little tricky to install, but take a few minutes to read the instructions and you'll get it.It was a little tricky to get it on, but once I figured it out, it's easy to adjust.Holds drinks very tightly - cup holder almost makes it difficult to get a larger water bottle into it - and sometimes getting it out can be difficult too.I received this cover as a gift when my son was born.It is a very soft and came in handy more than once when I had forgotten a blanket, and I thought it was beautiful.However, I struggled with getting it into a position so that I could see my baby, cover myself, and still have both hands available.It was better than just a blanket or a towel, but it was not easy to use and I HATED breast-feeding in public.Then my daughter came along, and not only was it a struggle to use, but she completely refused to latch on underneath it.The brush is adorable and the boar's hair is soft and perfect for a baby's fine hair.I read in another person's review that this had happened to theirs too but figured that it was just that particular brush or that they didn't follow the washing instructions properly, but it's actually the brush itself.I highly recommend it.I really like how one size is see through so you I can remember exactly what I put in there!The best toy I've bought for my son.Still can't believe the price.It was an amazing find.I would not recommend allowing an unaccompanied child, particularly a very little one, to play with this toy.Some of the vertical edges of the large cube are sharp and, in several places, rough.One of the bridges on top of the Center was not sanded down at all; it is very rough to the touch and could easily splinter.I liked that because it broadens a child's knowledge.However, the "u" animal was a unicorn - the only mythical creature represented; since "x" was represented by "X-Ray" I think it would have been better of the manufacturer had used a real object, e.g.I received this as a gift for my 7 month old son.My daughter has this and LOVES it... but I did get it out for her too soon, so I was one of those parents, however, I didn't blame the toy, I blamed myself.She tips it over all the time to look underneath, but understands now that she needs to do that away from herself and not ON herself.Secondly, there are many reviewers bashing that their infant found it boring... again, those reviewers stated that their infants were under 12 months.Ours is perfectly painted, sturdy construction, and smooth as can be.Companies need to know when they are doing a poor job, and simply returning the item doesn't do that.My daughter is now 16 months and plays with this daily.I agree that the ticket price is high, but in my opinion, compared with similar models, this one is superior and worth the money.Love how this gate simply rolls away to the side when not needed but when it's rolled out and locked in, it keeps baby safe!However, if you're holding a little one, you CAN open and close the gate one handed.The first time my daughter heard the noise, she was scared and cried for a moment or two.If not, she is sleeping in the other room - while you can hear the clicking in the other room, it does not wake her.I wonder if some of the people who say its impossible even read the directions?Its not exactly simple or obvious - but if you remember out, down, in - it will open every time!Just takes a little getting used to.AbsolutelyDefinitely worth it's price.I've been using this to wash our puppy in the tub until our baby is old enough to take baths there instead of the kitchen sink, and it is way more comfortable than a towel.It isn't worth the price and now I have to find something else.Shows C , not only F which is great since I'm used to using CThis works great right out of the box.I hope it keeps working!This thing is awesome!It's great!Baby loves the bath now and never screamed cuz of hot water anymore...It's pretty big, like toy size.For 5 bucks, it's worth every penny.for the first time parent who lacks experience.love it, has temp in F and C. Beeps when water is too warm or too cold.Clever Trever the turtle helped me make the temprature safe for my little man.I would highly recommend this thermometer to anyone who likes to bath their kids!!!It will beep when the water is higher then 100.Bought this and loved it the first few times I used.The reason for a 1-star is that after only 6 baths, water got inside the digital unit and it doesn't work anymore.The inside of the elbow has very sensitive skin, so if the water is too hot for the baby you will know.Now it turns itself on and off when checking temperature.I loved this at first.But, for some reason, they made the turtle's head come in two pieces and after a short while of using this, the head now comes off and because it's two pieces, they aren't very big, making this a choking hazard for my son.Not sure why they needed to put small pieces for the head on this.It was pretty much a guessing game everyday for 8 months!I don't know why I didn't get this sooner!Now I have the peace of mind of knowing exactly what the temperature is, and not what I assume it is because I've gotten used to it.Cute little gadget and my son loves the Turtle!Update (5/27/11): 2 STARS!Would now give it 2 stars.It started beeping when the water was the correct temperature for my wrist and my son!Just use your wrist/elbow and common sense!Also, I'm not good at judging water temperature for a baby since my own preference is practically scalding.It's a good size so it's easy to read the temperature and a good size for kids to play with.Definitely worth buying for the peace of mind.You don't have to stand there holding the thermometer, just let it float in the water and walk away to get baby ready for bath time.This bath thermometer is great!)Cons:None that I can think of.Neutral:The temperature is displayed first in Fahrenheit and then in Celsius.There is no way to change this that I am aware of.This thermometer is great.I keep it in the tub while I bath my daughter.I think this is a must buy for any parent!So, not recommended.HOW DID IT BREAK SO EASILY?Loved knowing the temperature of the water.We bought it for our newborn, and love it!I purchased this to make sure that the bath water was not too hot for my son.It's wonderful to be able to place this gadget directly in the water and have it give back a temperature reading in seconds.If it's too hot, it will continue to sound a soft alarm until the water reaches a safe temperature.Bought it for 4 yrs old.Worked great!The only things, was to put it together took a while, no very easy... but either that, the rail is great!It does offer a good deal of space though.The second way collects the water so you can leave this rack on the counter and just dump out the water.I think pretty much any rack would be a better choice than this one - look for more air flow under the items, or racks that hold items at an angle to let air in.I had the smaller munchkin one and it just wasn't user friendly with all the attachements the Dr. Brown's bottles havePros:-keeps you organized-drys the Dr. brown items very well-easy to clean the rack when dirty-space saverCons:-bottles tip from side to side if you're trying to access the bottom tray (oh well no biggy for me)I would buy it again in a heart beat!I should have just started with this.The rack itself is great, but definitely does not accommodate all of the parts I have to wash and dry!Still I don't think any other rack would have come close to what I need with the dr. brown's bottles.Because there are so many parts, I honestly don't know what would be better!(That's not my job!)I would recommend some other one and am only keeping it because it would be a hassle to return.In hindsight, I would have bought one of the rack's that spin or something, so that I could easily find and assemble the bottles.It is perfect for placing beside the master bed.Mother can sleep comfortably while baby is sleeping close beside her.My daughter mentioned today how much she appreciates it and how convenient it is for her and her baby boy.This co-sleeper is a nice compromise between a separate crib/bassinet and always having the baby in your bed.It also gives baby some practice sleeping on her own before we move her to a crib.We live in a 2-story home, we don't like a lot of clutter and wanted to have a bassinet option for our son to sleep him for the first few months.After seeing our friends standard size co-sleeper (same company) we decided that was WAY to big for us and would totally take over our master bedroom (we already had to make room for a glider that we bought).The mini-sleeper is great!Just rolled it right up next to my side of the bed (mesh side) so I could hear my son breath etc (you know how you check your newborn every minute to make sure they are alright).The pros:-like the wheels and the fact that they lock ( I could wheel him in the bathroom when I showered when he was really little and my husband went back to work)-mesh side so you can peek right in without getting up out of bed-pockets on both sides of sleeper (we stuck binky's and also the sound generator-we took it out of our sheep)-the zipped storage on the bottom for blankets, jammies etc-high enough so that our large mix labs could see and smell baby without "touching" him-waterproof pad (we still tucked a nice blanket over the pad which worked fineCons:-it' not the easiest thing to put togetherMy son is now almost 4 months.It's amazing how he's grown but he's stil sleeping in his mini-co sleeper in our room.We are transitioning him to his crib this weekend (not because the mini is too small).The best thing we brought for our son to sleep in!!We are hopefully planning to have #2 and this will be perfect again!PS: I did breastfeed my son but just found it easier to keep it as a bassinet rather than attaching it to the bed.Easier to get in/out of our king bed withOUT the mini attached to the bed.We are very happy with this set.We also painted the walls with the recommended "lemon-white" paint to coordinate.Now the nursery is one of my favorite rooms in the house.I can tell that my son really enjoys the characters.I'm so glad that our son has enjoyed it as well.The comforter isn't something you should use with a small baby.It is cushy and there are lots of textures to explore.When not in use, we hang it on the glider for decoration.While I like the theme, I didn't love all the pieces to death.I bought the blue/white cover and when I received it, realized that it was a cover for the original brest friend and not for the deluxe model.I received a Boppy pillow at my baby shower and it was the sole pillow I used at first.It is the perfect distance from his face to ours so he's not overwhelmed and he'll look at us.Kind of wish the two bumps on the top were remove-able.Nice and firm, and over-all happy with my purchase.I highly recommend this pillow for breastfeeding.It makes it worlds easier to be able to lay the baby along your body on this pillow.I received a boppy at my baby shower and I used it when my son was a newborn.The back support is awesome and I am 100x more comfortable nursing now, especially in the middle of the night.My son was a sloooooooooooow eater for the first few months.Love, love, love it!I bought this after all the recommendations but 3 1/2 months after baby was born I broke down and bought the boppy.Your hospital should have one you can borrow while you are there - that way you can figure out if this works well for you and order it accordintgly.I seem to read as 97 or 104 degrees with readings taken a minute apart.As others have said, this thermometer reads anywhere from 95-101 within a few seconds when taken from the same area on the body.I cannot trust this thermometer with my newborn son and would not recommend it to anyone.On one reading it will say 102.7 (which nearly stops your heart) and the next reading (within seconds of the last) will say 95.3 - and the readings continue on like that.i WAS really caught up in all the new baby items and havnt even used them.I tried it out at my lactation consultant's office and it was so much better!The relief on my back was wonderful after the first week of horrible neck and back pain.Pocket is great for cell phone, and I love that it's adjustable to any waist size, and doesn't lose its shape like the Boppy can.It is very firm and creates a shelf for the baby.My husband and I use it on the couch when we want to watch t.v.and have her on our lap.I got to try a My Brest Friend at the lactician's office and it was wonderful!After two visits to the lactician's, my husband went out and purchased the Deluxe Brest Friend.He's now a little over two months old and a wonderful 12lbs.There are some cons to the Brest Friend.I am large up top and it would be a task for me to hold my daughter and nurse, this is awesome.update - attached to baby bikeseat!Always worried by 1 yr old would need an emergency change/snack/etc.But now gotta find something else from my hubby - soon to be father of a third boy!I bought this based on looks alone, and if looks were the only thing that mattered this would have gotten five stars for how pretty it is.The built-in bottle brush is a nice touch and is definitely convenient, but creates even more of a water puddle in the base after use.I'm keeping it and using it since I already made the investment, but if I had to choose again I'd probably get a less pretty, more practical rack.I pack this item for my son's lunch box.I think she loves it so much because it's the easiest thing for her hands to manipulate.I bought this mirror for my baby boy to encourage him to do more tummy time.He is just right now holding his head up pretty well and hope he can start rolling over soon.I needed to find other things/items to entertain him while on his tummy so I bought this item.He loves it and we really both enjoy the music it plays.He knows the heart controls the music and will press on it like crazy when on my lap (which changes the lullaby).Son loved this since he was 2 month old.He's 9 month now and in different stages, he found different things amusing.The different fabrics offer differing tactile experiences to stimulate baby's sense of touch.The bright colors are visually stimulating.The hard rings are wonderful for gumming when baby's teeth are coming in.My 6 month old loves it!This toy is soft and colorful and has a jingle bell inside so when he hits it, it makes noise.Several textures and shapes come together to make a wonderful opportuinty for playful discovery.My daughter has started moving around now that she is 4 months while we are changing her diaper.From day one, my daughter has loved to look at Jacques from all sides.She grew attached to him to the point where he had to go everywhere with her, but with the nice Lamaze link that's not a problem!The color and scale of this toy is just right.If we have to go in anywhere, he is the perfect length to clip to the stroller clip on my diaper bag and not touch the ground when I set it down.And he's still very entertaining 3 months later.We received Jacques as a baby gift and initially as a newborn, my son was neither interested nor disinterested in it.He loved the colors on the front and the light reflecting off of the 'mirror'.He sat through my husband's graduation (2 hours long) quietly with me holding and shaking Jacques near him.I bought this for my son after he had a surgery done and he has loved it ever since.He loves it.. one of the best things I've bought, I can't wait to see him get more interactive with it, I can tell he really really wants to!Wonderful toy!!It is great with the black and white with red on the back side for intial few months.The different textures on the front are great as well as the squeaker in the toy.My son loves his Jacques, ever since he was first born, he would stare at it on car rides and in his stroller.Jacques the Peacock is a great educational toy for a wide range of ages.He crinkles, has a little mirror, features bright colors on one side and black white and red on the other.It attaches super easily to car seats and strollers and my son still loves it now that he's eight months old!We received Jacques the Peacock as a gift shortly after our baby was born.The back of Jacques is different black and white patterns and a big red tail.From what I understand black, white and red may be some of the only colors newborns can see.I bought this because my little boy ( now 7 months old ) really loved Freddy the Fire Fly.Jacques is much smaller, but still a nice size for the baby to play with.My son first smiled at this toy.We used to bring Jacques to doctor's office when my son got his shots, to distract him.It worked- my son hardly fussed at all!***Update:  my son is now 15 months old and he STILL loves this toy.It makes him smile, which makes me smile.I registered for Jacques because I thought he was cute and colorful, and he had good reviews.He was bigger than I anticipated, so I didn't give him to her right away and instead hung him from her activity mat.Now she holds him (and eats him!).I just leave it attached to the stroller and it keeps my little one entertained during our morning walks.They are colorful, fun, have many textures and make different noises when handled.She really loves to chew on them and make the crinkle and crunch in her hands.I really like that one side is all black and white for the earliest stages of visual development and the front is so incredibly colorful, with many different textures and even a mirror.Best of all, it seems like a very safe product - doesn't seem to have any parts that could easily come off and create a choking hazard.I think this is a great toy , my 4 month old likes to chew on it, when he does it makes crinkling sounds, it is very colorful to look at so it holds his attention for a while, It is a little big for him now , but he'll grow into it in a couple of months.My husband got this for our 4 month old girl for Chirstmas.She loves it!I can keep Jacques hooked to something so my baby can play with it and it doesn't end up on the floor tempting the dog to get it.We have Paddy the Panda, too, and she seems to love that one just as much.My 5 month old nephew loves this toy.Many colors and shapes and sounds of paper crinkle helps him with development.We consider Jacques to be part of the family, even though he's in a storage box, now.He was her first love.Something about Jacques was mysterious and intruiging to our infant.He enjoyed the high contrast black and white patterns on the back.At six months, he enjoyed the squeaker and crinkling it with his hands.There are multiple different textures and she likes to feel them all.They are all beautiful and good quality and all have teething rings, squeakers, crinkles, and rattles.BUT to be honest Jacques the Peacock beats them all so easily, my baby only cares about jack.This is one of my sons favorite toys.Now at five months, he still loves it.His face lights up whenever we bring it out and he never gets bored playing with it (we have the Firefly too, but he prefers the Peacock).Jacque captures my 5 week old's gaze and I think that it is very cute.We have two little ones chewing on the bird, spitting milk on it and dropping it on the floor when it's not attached.I had no choice but to put it in the washer and it survived!Not sure if I am compromising some aspect of this toy's safety or durability by washing it, but I believe that it is unsafe to use for babies if you can't wash it thoroughly.I used a cold gentle cycle and dried it in the dryer.Otherwise it's a wonderful toy and the little ones were attracted to the big eyes even at a very young age - I have photos of them around two months old looking at the bird with interest.Now they are six months old and love to ruffle it's tail.He is colorful, has different parts that are different textures, and can be hung from a play mat.The differing textures are wonderful to help develop baby's tactile sense.Mortimer has a soft, curly coat which is wonderful for cuddling.He is a larger toy and tiny infants will not be able to grasp him at first.They are colorful, well made items that engage baby and help develop his/her senses.Also doesn't like chewing on antlers- I think they are a bit too hard.She bats it around and coos at it--it is a great favorite!He has good sounds that are great for hearing development and bright colors for visual development.It's well made and she loves the teething "ears."I purchased both Mortimer the Moose andLamaze Freddie the Fireflybefore my son was born.The moose is quite soft, cuddly and just the right size for my son to hold and play with.He loves looking at and chewing on Mortimer's colorful hooves (the hooves crinkle and chime when squeezed).The teether antlers are large and made of a soft rubber gentle enough for delicate gums.First are the colors, then are the noises it makes and the textures are attractive too.I would recommend it for 2 month to 8 months old babies.A Colorful moose!The antlers are great for teething & the Visual stimulation is great!We received Mortimer as a baby shower gift.Now that our son is a little over 3 months, I love to see how much he enjoys his moose.The size is perfect for him to hug and push around.At this stage, our son likes to grab the crinkly ears and easily grabs the fabric legs.We love Mr. Mortimer the Moose!This critter is really cute and I'm sure our soon-to-be-born grandson will like it as much or more than the adults who fussed over it at the baby shower.Really nice item.My son got this toy when he was 3 months old and around a year later still plays with it.I love all the patterns and textures,a nd she can grab his little stringy legs.I know the Peacock is really popular, but I actually like this version better because with the legs you have more for the baby to grab & play with.This one is a nice break from all the crinkling.My daughter from 1 month now to 9 months, just chucks this toy aside in preference for more interesting toys.It has really been a life saver, keeps him quite occupied for a while!There is only one arm that doesn't sound so great because the squeak is very quiet compared to the others.unlike some toys, the notes are right on key.You do not need to know all the notes.One day I was listening to some music with my then 5month son and I was hitting any notes (legs) and my son was loving it on key or off key (mostly waaay off note)It's durable.Had it for 9 month and still in a good shape.Oh, and the vanilla scent is quite strong, though we like it.My 2 month old loves this ocotpus.It doesn't always work but it works often enough that it is already worth the price.While the reviewer who said it is not very easy to squeeze the arms to create notes is correct, it is still an excellent toy and my son loves it.When he is fussy I start making some simple music and he loves it.pros:1) Great introduction to musical notes, especially if you are musically inclined and can name the notes2) Excellent colors3) No Batteries4) smells good.12 months and over is probably the average age that a baby will be able to create notes themselves.That's really all...great toy!These are not great as a stacker because they fall over, but I use them to teach about magnetism.It is fun for kids to stick these together and learn how magnets work.The colors are great!When we are going to visit family and friends I fill it up with toys and when we get there we have a variety of toys and the shape sorter to play toy peek a boo with.She provides plenty of stimulation for a young baby as well as older with her contrasting predominately black and white color scheme.As my daughter has begun to teethe on everything she has derived a lot of satisfaction from chewing on Patty's ring with spinning beads.She's easy enough to surface wash with a mildly soaped up warm cloth.If she gets a bit linty a lint roller cleans her up nicely.The flowers that she holds are texture filled and seem to be sewn in very well so I'm not too worried about them detaching and becoming a possible choking hazard.With our first child, I bought these so our baby could have some stimulation when he was young.These are more entertainment for adults because the baby didn't really notice them because he had to wave his wrist directly in front of his eyes, which happens like once in a blue moon.I hope my bb will enjoy touching her feet!My baby loved chewing on them more than anything.If I had known that the rattling sound wasn't more noticeable, I probably wouldn't have purchased them.my two month old daughter loves these.Safe, educational and entertaining.Nicely made.I read the great reviews and thought this would be great for my 3.5 month old daughter since she likes to watch her hands move a lot.I like the music options.I got a "good job Grandma" from my DIL.She and my son are both teachers.....no pressure there!A nice toy overall with music, visual stimulus and fine motor skills rewards.This was given to my daughter as a gift when she was just 3 months old.She absolutely loves it.When she first received it, we would sit it in front of her and play the music for her (music plays when you push the flowers) and her eyes would get super wide and she'd reach out for it.It seems that the screw is stripped so it won't budge :o( I might have to get another one of these for her just because she loves it so much.I highly recommend it!Bought it for my 5 months old and he loves it -- both touching the flowers for the music, and chewing on and touching the leaves!Would recommend it for babies that can sit (was not so great before my son could sit)He gets a good 30 minutes of entertainment from the crinkly wings and colorful torso.My baby loves the high contrast black and white.Colors are great and she loves the crinkly wings as well as the different textures.There is also a squeak ball on one of the wings and a little red teether bug attached to another wing.The fact that it has a loop/ring attached is awesome because I can hook it on to the car seat or his stroller or whatever and we're off and he's got Freddie with him!The bright colors are great and the back of the wings have black and white patterns which is a huge plus!Babies love the black and white!This toy has been my son's favorite for six months now and I'm sure it will continue to be his favorite for a long time!We love it and know that she's always happy with it!We bought it when she was 2 1/2 months.This toy was a great favorite of my eldest son, and a year later it is now a favorite of his younger brothers.My older son loved the eyes and crinkly wings; the younger two enjoy playing the teether and the wings.The link makes it easy to take this toy with you either attached to a stroller or a car seat.makes alot of noises,rattling noises, squeaky noises and crinkly noises.babies love the colors, patterns and different textures of freddie the firefly.a little expensive but i guess it's worth it if it keeps the baby quiet for a good few minutes.They are colorful, fun, have many textures and make different noises when handled.She really loves to chew on them and make the crinkle and crunch in her hands.Happy Happy Joy Joy!;)This is a visually beautiful and highly interactive rattle style toy.She loves it now, however.I expect she will only love this toy more as she ages.At 3 months, she loves to touch and grasp the crinkly wings and it is fun to dangle the teether in front of her.Somehow she is fascinated by the red color.When she was a newborn she seemed to really like it when we flipped the front of the bug (colorful) to the black and white side.We extended the reach of it by adding more links to it.It's a fantastic item.I highly recommend it.Also loves to chew on freddies head.My daughter got this as a gift and she LOVES it.She liked it starting around 3 months and really gets into it now she is five months.It went through the wash once and held up.I'm keeping it in case we have another baby, and I have given it as a gift several times.I received this from my registry and hung it over the baby's changing table from day one.He never paid it much attention, or so I thought, at first.Until he was 4mos we left it hanging there until one day I saw him looking at it very purposefully.This toy is nicer than in the photo!The fabrics are very intense, vivid colors, with attractive textures and designs.My daughter had this as an infant and into her first year.She loved it because of the bright colors, crinkly noises and happy face (at least that is my perception - she wasn't talking much at 8 months :-)I have since purchased two more for teachers going on maternity leave.My baby and I highly recommend.It can be clipped to a myriad of items from the carseat, activity mat, to the jumperoo.Son wasn't interested in Freddie until he was able to use his hands.Freddie the Firefly is one of the most entertaining toys my son owns (we also haveLamaze Mortimer the Moosewhich my son loves as well).The colors on the front of the fly are quite vivid and the back of the fly is a black and white pattern.I've bought this toy for my 4 month old son.He grabs the different parts easily, swats at it, shakes it and puts it in his mouth.we love freddie and so does my daughter.My son got it when he was 4.And he absolutely loved it.I should have bought it earlier.My son is currently almost 6 months old, and he has had it since he was about 2 months.The teething berry that sits in the small pocket is wonderful, as my son started teething very early on.I attach this to her Tiny Love play mat, to her stroller, etc.Freddie was recommended to me by a friend whose baby loves Freddie.It hangs in the playgym and is the perfect size with great features for the baby.My baby started playing with when he was 1 month old by pushing it to make noise from the rattle.As days go by, he keeps playing with it and discovering new textures and colors of the toy.Excellent design to occupy the baby and give parents some time to eat or get some chores done!There are lots of things to chew on, the bug on the rope is always entertaining, and the legs and antennas are great for chewing/sucking on, fun crinkly sounds, squeaks, etc.This was much larger than I had anticipated.I love it since my little one can easily grab it.There are a lot of different textures and sounds.My baby loves this giraffe.Also hooks to her exersaucer which is awesome.It is an awesome toy and my baby seems very interested in all of its parts--from the colorful feet, to the stretchy legs, to the ribbon hair, to the plastic rings.Visually pleasing.Crinkle skirt.Has several "taggies" for fine motor skills.Love the fact it has the large loop to secure it to carseat, stroller, etc.I also read that there's no distortion so I thought it would be great.My son enjoyed looking at it and he's only 10 weeks old.I read that someone didn't get the bright orange mirror that's in the main picture on this page, and received the purple one instead.I ended up receiving the purple one.We LOVE this mirror and more importantly, our 5 month old son loves this mirror.We've been using it since he was born and it's still going strong.That's not to say that he couldn't hold more comforting possibilities instead of just being educational.Very sweet!The unit is properly assembled and set up with the frame locked into place.I expect to see a recall on this item any time.The straps are cheap and cut into the passenger's skin, and the underside of the lap bar has sharp edges, which cut into a baby's skin when it is rubbed up against or kicked.We like the music options and the volume of the music.The swing runs quietly and smoothly,Seat is soft and comfy!We are VERY happy with our purchaseBefore my son was born, I had to have this swing!It is everything I hoped it would be and more.I love the option to go from cradle to front facing, and the battery or plug in use option.It's colorful and the mobile is bright and fun.The 3 different music options are great also.My son is now almost 7 months old and has been using it since birth.She doesn't really like the vibration, though, so we don't use that feature.I see that some people complain about the volume of the music, but it doesn't bother me.However, I still think Fisher Price should make it a little stronger.Soon after my baby was born, I started the search for a good bouncer.From day one, he loves this bouncer.He loves to pull on the parrot and monkey.I like many features on this bouncer.You can have it set on continuous lights and music or it can be set to motion-activate so that it makes sounds when your baby pulls on the monkey or parrot.We had it for almost 2 months before we had to change it and my son uses it every day!I packed it in our suitcase easily.When you have many things to do and your baby doesn't seem to want to cooperate, this is the item you need.This bouncer features moving parts (monkey and frog) that will attract your baby's attention, guaranteed.It also has lights and nice music, while also offering the option of soothing vibration.It is very easy to install and it is very light and manageable; the cover removes easily to wash.If you have a very young baby you might want to hold using it for a bit, since the baby's head will just roll to the sides; or you can use one of those pillows that hold the baby's head in place (from my experience my baby doesn't like them too much, maybe you are lucky).The incline feature is very useful if your little one suffers from reflux since keeping the baby upright, after feeding, for the 15 - 30 minutes your doctor may recommend can be tiring if the baby is large or it is o-dark-thirty at night.The incline is also nice because once your baby is a bit older and staying awake more, you can move the seat from room to room as you go about your daily life.This allows the baby to observe different environments and allows you to explain your activities so that the baby's language learning can advance.We found the "bouncy" feature, actually a vibrating, very useful when the baby was fussy or when he was having difficulty going to sleep.It was soothing and helped calm him down.The arched toy which can be attached and turned on is another very nice feature.The colorful parts are eyecatching and stimulate your baby's visual sense.The Rainforest Bouncer is useful up to about 20 pounds.Regardless, this is one piece of equipment that is essential for any parent or caregiver - it fills a number of useful functions, is well made, and is reasonably priced.I love this one!My baby is 15 lbs now, used it since birth, still great!This bouncy is great.Our baby loves her bouncer!first of all my son hates it.absolutely hate this baby item!We are generally very happy with the chair.I wish they'd make this chair (minus the light bar) and just have the nice deep seat and the vibration (for like 35-40.00 bucks).that would be enough and well worth the cost.Pros:-comfy-very secure-my son loves it and it's a life saver when I need to shower, cook etc.Too much stim especially for a young infant (ours is almost 4 months).I absolutely love this bouncer!It's also a lightweight bouncer that you can transport easily.Our son didn't even care or like this bouncer until the 8 week mark.Now he loves it!I love this bouncer!Not only does it vibrate, but it also helps the baby practice hand-eye coordination AND cause and effect (that's right, science at 3 months).I love watching the huge smiles my babies give when they hit the animals and the waterfall lights up.Other great features: very light and easily portable, and can be adjusted to have the baby lay more or less upright (depending upon your preference).We went to Babies R Us to get a similar one, so that the twins have variety.This is a great bib if you're baby is a drooler.It was well packaged and everything went together without a hitch.We bought the Starlight model since it has a plug.So the trick for us seems to be; no front-to-back unless she's already been resting in the inclined position for at least 30 minutes.I know, I know, they're not as fragile as we think they are but it wouldn't be comfortable for me so I can't see how she would enjoy it.Anyway, I like the head rest, my only gripe is I wish it was removable.The music gets on my nerves after awhile.She definitely likes the mobile and at 3 weeks that's impressive.Though I still feel like a cross bar that maybe dropped down once the legs were open would help me feel better about the stability.Still it's a small gripe.Again we just got it so I'll try to update this in a month or 2 if anything changes.Here's my summaryPROS:Easy to assemble.Easy to use.She sleeps right away in it.Feels safe so far.Lots of options for fine tuning (with the exception of speed).Plug's in!(Starlight Model)Mobile and lights hold her interest.Cute.CONS:Speed dial seems worthless.Swing has one speed.Motor may not have enough "oomph" for larger babies (unsure about this one).Cushion is one piece, not as easy to wash as it could be.Click may be annoying for some light sleepers.Could use a cross bar between the legs for added stability when moving the unit around.My son did love this swing and I loved the fact that it plugged into the wall.All the other features work: lights, music.I would have used it with my son, but it was pink.This Swing is a must for any parent of a new baby!Me and my wife are new parents of a baby boy and sometimes he just wants all the attention.At a month old we put him in this swing and it is incredible how quiet he stays watching the little bear and 2 stars circle around while listening to the music.This swing is SUPER easy to install.It is very cute, but most important of all, it has an AC adapter!!Just plug it to the wall, adjust the settings and that's it!she smiles and coos at it and can see herself in the mirror underneath the mobile also.the seat cover is very plush and all of the fabric removes for easy washing.the motor on the swing is pretty quiet.legs on the swing are sturdy and it is very stable while in motion.my one complaint is that the music only plays for 7 minutes before having to press the reset button so it will start up again.this is not really a big deal, but it would be nice to be able to set it for 20 minutes and forget about it.while this item may seem a little pricey, it's totally worth it!Bought this swing in May and it has been great.I was only going to give it 4 stars because of the "known" motor issue, however, the great customer service from Fisher Price makes up for the defect.It switches to the three positions really well.The light show is cool, but not really worth the extra money.This is a very cute swing with nice music, but even on the lowest speed, it is way too fast for a newborn baby.Also, they should really make an option to plug it in and perhaps making the colors of the mobile more vibrant.However, don't expect too much in terms of quality.I don't think this would last through multiple children or work for larger, older babies.We bought the Starlight Papasan cradle swing in a moment of desperation when our son was a week old.(Thank you Amazon for one day delivery!)Honestly, the color is well-chosen to fit for either a girl or a boy.Though adjustable, the baby is always reclining more than about 45degrees.He's a large baby at just under 17lbs now.There is play in the bolt that holds the seat in place.It's still secure and safe; but I don't like seeing the seat wiggle or tilt.Fisher Price could have had a better design or higher precision machining.Second, the wiggling of the frame during operation is easily noticeable; the top translates 5-10mm during swinging.Sure enough, our baby never took to it even though she loved for me to put her in a swinging motion in my arms.So we splurged for this swing based on the excellent reviews and are very pleased with it:Pros-1.Seems to be very comfortable for her.3.Pretty good selection of sounds and music, hasn't gotten on our nerves yet.5.Volume for sounds and music is adjustable!Motor does make a bit of noise, but I think it is actually somewhat soothing.Cons-1.At least make an AC adapter an option, I'd have happily paid and extra $10 or $15 for one.2.The music and mobile are on a non-adjustable timer.Called the 800 number in the directions, and had to navigate a bit of a maze of prompts, but then was immediately greeted by a live, friendly (non-outsourced) human.So we went about a week without music until it arrived, but overall I'm very pleased with Fisher-Price's customer service.Much better than I've grown accustomed to lately.For the first month or so I'll admit that our son (now 2 1/2 months old) wasn't a huge fan of this swing- he didn't dislike it but it wasn't anything special either.However, over the past 2 weeks he has been LOVING it.i don't like to review an item right away because i don't know if it's really good or not.it is sooo soft and plush and the music is so calming, my son almost can't sleep unless it's on!:) it swings great and the different speed settings are great!So quality is definitely a bonus here.Why risk $100+ dollars on something that is probably going to break?The sounds are nice, the stars are really sweet (when it's dark), and the swing is really plush.Also, in the pictures the fabric looks more blue than purple, but it is VERY purple.My son hated this swing until he was 3 months old.Now, he loves it when we turn out the lights so he can see the stars reflect off of the mesh netting.What a great deal for $99.I love that there are 6 speeds and that you can adjust the volume and can choose whether or not to have the top mobile part move or not.It was great for our baby girl.So we decided to purchase this version, since it plugs into the wall.We used it for four solid months, and then suddenly it started going slower and slower, the music and mobile stopped working, etc.I called Fisher-Price, assuming we would be out of luck, but they were SUPER.It is truly a lifesaver and as far as I'm concerned, Fisher-Price's customer service cannot be beat!My husband says that he found in his research that all the other swings are powered in pretty much the same way.Everywhere else, he wakes up every 10 minutes.My only complaint is that you can't remove the head support.Great price for this item!I was very pleased when I received it and so was my 26 month old daughter!Highly recommend!It's not worth returning it and paying for shipping, so I ended up throwing this out.The calendar was given to me as a gift.Because you have to fill in the dates, Sunday isn't always on the left where a traditional calendar would place it.The stickers are an adorable feature, but it's for those mom's to be who are looking for a more medical pregnancy labor and delivery.It perfectly matches our Kalani espresso crib.Like other people said, it DOES scratch real easily, indeed.In the end, it is rock solid.DaVinci is a Million Dollar Baby brand, excellent customer service.Better instructions + parts need to be labeled.2.This piece arrived in excellent condition.I worked on the drawers and my husband put the frame together.It looks fantastic in our nursery.Baby won't be here for a few more months, but it seems very sturdy and I know I will love having the extra drawer space!The mattress pad that comes with it is so-so.Should do the job just fine!My five month old LOVES "Mr G Raff" - he loves to suck on the face and the legs and he delights in the squeak!It is easy to wash and easy to reach for and hold - deserves all of the hype!My son adores his Sophie.He is constantly chewing on her.She was a perfect toy for our son to hold before he was able to grip very well because she is very light.After watching my little niece interact with Sophie I couldn't wait to buy one for my son.He loves biting on her, he loves squeaking her and he loves holding her legs.Was definitely a great buy, if you haven't already bought a Sophie for your little one - please do!She is great!!As soon as I showed it to him it went in his mouth and he has happily played with it every since.He loves chewing on all parts of it!I bought it because of its great review however my 6 month old son doesn't care for this item at all.He chew on everything but this giraffe.This giraffe come in a box that is very nice, and has its birth certificate or something like that.It is able to stand too.I am not sure why my son doesn't like it.The second time, the giraffe's pointy ear poke his eye.He tried the leg, but it seems like he can choke on it, so I suggest parents keep an eye on their babies while using this item.He loves to squeak her and chew on her legs.Sophie is the perfect size for teething babies to grab and munch on, without worrying about the possibility of choking.Whenever she visits, Sophie is her best buddy.I would definitely recommend Sophie to any parent of a teething baby, and even babies who aren't.She's just about the perfect baby toy!I got this as a gift.My baby loves chewing on Sophie's ears.I do like it that it's natural and painted with food paint.But now she loves munching on Sophie's hooves.The baby still loves it at 9 months.I think a lot of people are exaggerating when they say that they've found their kids "turning blue" from choking on a leg.I stumbled across Sophie online and saw that it received a TON of reviews and they were all 4 and 5 stars.I read that it was great for teething babies and decided that my little chewer may like it as well.I thought the price was a bit high when we bought it, but believe me, it was totally worth it and I would recommend every mother of a teething baby to buy it!She smiles when I squeak her.Wonderful toy, worth the price.Baby girl just loves Sophie!It was the first toy she actually started engaging with (~3.5mo), being able to grasp and suck on it - highly recommend it.Sophie comes with a great story as well.Sophie is easy to hold, everywhere.Her spots really grabs babies attention & she's lightweight and easy for little ones to squeak.She's also a huge hit for teething.I even purchased a second as a gift for a friends baby who loves her now as well.Gentle smelling.Its really light & texture smooth & soft.Easy to grasps for small hands.But its beyond words how funny it looks when my bb tries to strangle Sophie for a passionate kiss haha!I attended a mom's group meeting when my son was about 3 1/2 months old and was just starting to get his first teeth.The legs are great for him to soothe his gums in the back of his mouth.It smells a little funny when you first open it up (it's natural rubber) but the smell goes away within a couple of days.My son is now almost 9 months old and still likes to chew on it.She loved Sophie instantly and even at 17 months she still plays with it.All in all we loved getting this as it was something we would not have likely purchased on our own but have since gotten it for others for shower gifts.It was excellent for teething.Of course my baby loves her easy to grab giraffe with spots (that do rub off after continued teeth action and after some detergents get onto it).I decided to order this after seeing this was the #1 most popular baby item on Amazon and #1 on new moms' wish lists on Amazon...wanted to see what the Sophie-hype was all about.My son loves Sophie!My son will be turning 7 months old next week and just wants to chew on anything he can get his hands on.Very easy for my son to chew on, and he loves her little squeak!Gets a smile out of him every time!I don't really notice a rubbery smell to Sophie as other reviewers have mentioned.If anything, it is very, very faint.Our 7-month old loves this teether.It's also great for teething w/o looking like a teether.Yes, some of the FOOD GRADE (so no worries, parents, it's safe) paint came off on the ears and hooves where she chewed it, but that was expected.I will be getting Sophies as gifts for any baby showers I attend.I also love that she comes with a little story and everything.We love Sophie!I inspect it regularly and it is nice and solid.My baby started playing with it at 2 mos, he is now almost 5 and still loves her.She is sturdy and I appreciate the fact she is safe for baby.It is soft, flexible, great for teething baby.My grandson loves it!He started teething at an early age.My daughter loves chewing on this.Sophie has become a bug part of our family.She sleeps with my baby, travels to different countries with the family and entertains our little man for hours.I would highly recommend this simple toy to any parents and baby.I love this!My son started teething @ 3 months old & didn't want anything to chew on but his fist (which didn't get the job done).Then my mom bought this giraffe for him and he loved it!When I hand it to him his face just lights up, even if he's playing with something else.It's so easy for him to hold, pass from hand to hand, and he likes chewing on different parts of Sophie.My 4 months old has been chewing happily on Sophie for a month now.Soft, easy to hold and my son LOVES to chew,suck,hold this giraffe.WELL WORTH the price!We stepped out of the room to change a diaper and the dog, who normally shadows us, was nowhere to be seen.LOL... every chance he gets!Anyway, we can legitimately say that the WHOLE family loves this toy!Great quality, I highly recommend it for your teething child.He loves this giraffe!Sophie has been a life saver for our son.She is cute, she makes noise, she is soft, and all natural.We had a selection of about 8 different teethers for our son starting out - hard, soft, ones you freeze or chill, cloth, etc, but none of them appealed to him.However, Sophie has been great.This has been one item I would not do without and would recommend to any parent.My son is 7 months old and Sophie goes EVERYWHERE with us!My son laughs and laughs every time she squeaks.I highly recommend her!My baby girl loves her sophie.Its fun to watch them figure out how to make her make a noise and her legs and neck makes it easy for little hands to grip her.This is a great teether if your child is not allergic to Latex.My son has loved this toy since he was about 4 months (currently 6mo).It doesn't look like much but it has all kinds of perfect surfaces for chewing.Seriously, he loves it!Makes it a great treat to buy for baby showers/new baby gifts.I bought this for when I flew for the first time with my 5 month old daughter.To say I was a little wary about spending almost $20 on a teething toy is an understatement, but I liked that it is made of natural rubber and food paint and had an established history.Right away my baby loved Sophie.It was very easy for him to hold and as he was moving the feet up and down on his gums about 1 minute after my giving it to him, I felt so relieved that he might be getting some relief during his teething.It was well worth the money.ALso, the dishwasher leaves strange dark bruises on it.For the cost and reviews I had high expectations for Sophie!My daughter likes the Sophie but is not in love with the Sophie like I had hoped.Perfect for little baby-grasp.The ears and snout are my baby's favorite to chew on, though she does occasionally take to a hoof or the butt.My daughter took a while to warm up to Sophie -- maybe three months and a bit?But now (4 mo)... oh boy... now her face just LIGHTS UP when she sees Sophie.She reaches out, grabs her rubber giraffe, and stuffs that little french creature straight in her gummy, drooly, slobbery mouth.She's a HUGE hit in our house.Definitely one of the baby's absolute favorites.We just got this in today and my son loves it!It's easy for him to hold, he loves to look at it, and also likes the squeaky noises it makes.He loves holding it upside down and chewing on its feet and legs!I liked that Sophie was 100% natural rubber and safe for my twins to chew.Last night when the baby was crying my older son specifically hunted out Sophie and brought her to the baby saying "Here you go, this always makes you happy!"I can't speak for the baby on this one as she isn't born yet, so I don't know how satisfactory this product is as a teether but as a parent, I really like its shape, color contrast and simplicity.And the giraffe's spots seem like an easy contrast for a baby to recognize.The packaging suggests wiping with a warm rag and not rinsing or sanitizing heavily, which I'm not sure how I feel about yet.**UPDATE** 8/15/2012My daughter is no longer teething but when she did, this was an excellent teether for her!Her chubby hands were able to grab onto it because Sophie is so long, its flexible so my daughter couldn't poke herself in the eye with one of Sophie's horns or legs and she loved making Sophie squeak!I've bought and recommended this teether for all of my friends who've gotten pregnant after me and its been a big hit!I knew I wanted to get this teether before my baby was even born.My now 7 month old daughter loves knawing on this.She loves the legs the best.My son loves this and he can easily grip it himself.I never leave home without it as it too keeps him occupied in the dreaded carseat.There are a few things my baby and I use everyday, and would be a little lost without.).The squeaker stops working if you get it wet.She smells like natural rubber.Some children are not interested in her.Sometimes the spots can start to wear off.She is not cheap.This toy has been on the market for over 50 years and is considered safe, so that addresses the possible choking hazard issue, and the other complaints are open to individual interpretation.Despite the price tag we decided to give Sophie a chance.So now here is the love letter part.Dear Sophie,We love you, you french vixen!), I found that you were constructed better than expected.SAFE!!!Your spots and large eyes were very attractive!I actually liked it(the smell has faded)and my son seems to like it too.The rest is history.You Sophie however, are light weight, flexible, and have a nice shape making you easy to hold on to.What's not to love?You are easy to clean(a wet cloth or wipe is all it takes), durable, and highly entertaining.On more than one occasion in public(several restaurants, 2 holidays at the in-laws, a movie theater, the Borders Cafe last night, ect., ect., ect.)Thanks for being so great Sophie, and looking forward to many more adventures together.&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3My son LOVES his Sophie.He carries her everywhere, and is constantly chewing on her.The most important thing is that it is a french hand made, so no china here :)Ok, to be honest I thought I had lost my mind to order this.especially for something I KNOW the baby will be chewing on.What I did not expect was it to get rave reviews in my house already.Texture??I do not know, but he is just entranced with it at 2??Needless to say, I now have 2 $25 teethers and am happy with both of them.My daughter just started teething and doesn't seem very interested in the teething rings.Seems to do it's job!That's what my husband said when I got this.But, Sophie has become a beloved member of the household.Even though I squeezed it out, I'm sure there was still some moisture left and I wonder if it resulted in mold or mildew inside Sophie.I love how easy it is for a baby to hold, how soft the giraffe is, the cute face, etc.My son wasn't too interested in Sophie at first.Everytime he sees her he gets this huge smile on his face.I am very happy with my purchase, and want to point out to give it some time if he's not interested at first.My 6 month old loves this!Why?-The texture is perfect for massaging the sore gums that are producing teeth.-It has multiple areas on which to chew: four separate legs, two ears and a nose.-The neck is the perfect size to allow infants to grasp the giraffe steadily and to manipulate it in the mouth easily.-The squeaker is harsh, and not necessary for the purpose of the teether, but might offer some "cause and effect" benefit.-It is not gender specific.-It wipes off easily (except newspaper print).-It is the perfect size to throw in the diaper bag or purse.Because Sophie has become an invaluable asset, we have found a way to attach a "link-a-doos" between the front legs and over the body so Sophie can be connected to the car seat, stroller or diaper bag.Now it just sits collecting dust.I should also note there are a couple of undesirable features that you should be aware of with regards to this product.First, be very careful when you wash this thing.Of all the things i like about sophie, is the fact that its not made in china and i know my neice is safe when she puts it in her mouth.It makes a great gift.It is a great toy for babies to chew on, soft and firm with just enough give to relieve their need to chew.My son started showing an interest in Sophie at around 4 months, but not before that.Once he could grasp it, he loved it (an easy toy for little hands to hold)!I thought this would be a nice teether for my three-month-old, since her mouth is too small for most teething aids.I would recommend this to the owner of a small dog, but not to a parent.He is six months old now and it seems to sooth him when he chews on it.I also feel comfortable about the material it is made of, but that could just be marketing.It is soft and pliable, easy to chew.I seriously don't know what all the fuss is about this thing.My son is just starting to teeth and this is the one thing that he will chew on and suck on for relief.He reaches for, holds on to it and seems to really enjoy it.The giraffe is safe, easy to clean, simple to travel with and perfect!Highly recommend it.The price is worth it- other teething items do not compare.Plus, my son actually uses this!This teether is cute and my son seems to like it.He wasn't interested in chewing on it until AFTER his teeth came in, but my dog was interested from day one when she heard the giraffe squeaking.The teether is cute, easy to clean, and easy to find due to its larger size.I got this when my son was 20 months old b/c he was getting his back teeth and kept sticking his hand way down his mouth to knaw on them.So I thought this one would be great for him.I still think it would have been great for him, but he wouldn't give it the time of day.He was already happy to just knaw on his hand.We're expecting another baby now and I'll give this to him at a much younger age and see if maybe he'll take it better :)He LOVES Sophie.He can easily hold her by the legs or by the neck, can grab her with both hands, and loves to chew on her face or any part of her body.Great for little hands and teething.It's fairly easy for him to grab and hold and then he chews on either the head or the legs.Nice texture and look.Well worth the price.It is in the same great condition as when we got it.My daughter loves her Sophie- she can not have enough of her!Great quality teether.I think she likes the contrasting color, it's light enough for a four month old to handle, the legs fit perfectly in the mouth to soothe the front teeth.This is a really great teether.My first child love it, but then we lost it.The monkey backpack has always been a happy/fun thing so my girls are more than happy to put it on in public.These have come in SO handy on many different occasions.It is really big on Madison, she is tiny for her age, below the 5th% but it still works just fine.The backpack is really only big enough for some small snacks or pacifier.Obviously you can't use these everywhere as it just would not be safe.Anywhere that is really crowded, most people aren't looking for a tiny toddler.I did like the color and the actual netted seat that the bath came with.Our three month old can grasp it easily and get it to her mouth.This item is a 2-pack of manual diaphrams with the stem that works on the manual Avent Isis pumps.Good job Amazon for having them in stock!Although difficult to attach to the faucet, the Sassy did fit onto the 20 year old fixture and did not leak.The spray was not forceful which was a positive as her son got used to being bathed in the big tub.Unfortunately, that tub in which the Sassy was being used was the one in the guest bathroom.My son has the giraffe and this sheep, and the sheep is definitely best for him.The giraffe only has one sound that my son likes when he goes to bed, versus the sheep, which offers four sounds that my son loves.It's super soft and a great thing for my son to hold tight when he goes to bed.His favorite sound is the ocean noise, which I have to say, is my favorite as well.It features the sounds of a gentle stream, rain, ocean waves and whales, all of which put him to sleep fairly easily and actually help my husband and I relax after a busy day as well.A great buy overall and I would definitely recommend it to any parent!I had a baby boy on 10/21/09.The white noise player is tucked into a pocket in the back of an adorable little plush sheep.The reason to get the "On the Go" versus the regular Sheep is simple: portability.I literally would just put the Sheep on, strap it around my wrist, and then carry my son around the house (swaddled up) when he started crying.We used it daily for about 8 weeks, and we still use it intermittently now that my son is 4 months old.We used this religiously for almost three whole months attached to our daughter's bassinet.Unfortunately, the inside component went dead and we thought oh well we got three months out of it and moved on.About three months later I realized that I could probably email the company and ask them if there was a way to get a replacement part.I would have contacted them sooner, but I'm sure you understand that with a new baby it's not the top priority.My 5-week old loves his sleep sheep!If he wakes up & I have to settle him back down...I just turn it back on.-The volume control is great!I turn it up in noisier environments or if mounted farther away from his ears.-Super soft & cuddly!Pretty cute too!-Easily attaches anywhere!If I had seen this one before I bought my original size one...I would have just purchase 2 of these & saved the cost difference (paid $5 more for the full size).Every mom should have one!We used our sleep sheep constantly when our son was first born.It helped soothe him everywhere from his bassinet to his carseat to his stroller.As my son got older he was awakened from his sleep on more than one occasion by this feature.3) There are no womb sounds or mothers heartbeat, which should be a MUST on any infant sound machine.I received this item as a gift and have been using it for about two months.It's a wonderfully soft stuffed animal... totally cuddleable.It fits nicely on my Uppababy Vista 2010.The size is large and useful.Huge, sturdy and does not move on the stroller.Incredible invention.I find the mechanism safe and easy to operate as well.After purchasing a less than quality glider and having to return it, I decided to spend the extra money and go for the one I really wanted.I am so happy that I did.This glider is so comfortable and really nice quality.I love how it reclines and locks into 6 different positions, that was a must for me.The color in the picture is accurate as well.My husband is 5'7" and 160 and he fits really well also.It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition.We bought this chair right before our first son was born.Early on (say the first 3 months of his life) I spent nearly 7 to 8 hours a day in this chair because my son loved to be rocked and it was the perfect chair to nurse him in.The arms are a perfect height to rest the Boppy on and feed him comfortably.This simple little strap works great.Nice to have.My husband and I where looking for something easy to take our infant around the Airport.We do a lot of traveling and I couldn't imagine having to carry my son through the airport.We saw a few other Items that cost $100 and i couldn't spend that much.I found this and thought I would just try it out.WE LOVED IT!So easy to take off and put on.It makes our trips effortless.I think this mobile is very neat looking, and sturdy.The rain forest sounds are a little quiet but that's okay because they are mostly crickets anyway.Our baby LOVED his wind-up mobile, but the music didn't last long enough for us to get anything done or for him to stay happy!We don't usually turn the actual unit off, so it can be operated by the remote control any time.Overall we really like it for its length of operation, its design and its ability to entertain baby.The second is the music.Maybe he's just sensitive though...Overall it was a great purchase for the price and we use it very often.this thing is awesome!!my 3 month old son adores the mobile and the music is very soothing!!!love the remote too!My three month old loves this mobile!It was easy to assemble and the remote feature is awesome!My son loves looking at this and I can do some things around the house while he plays quietly in his crib.Great mobile!It is amazing.That way when we moved him from his bassinet to the crib, the transition was smooth.I had already bought one for his crib and it was well worth it.I wish there had been some way to tell before ordering, but this mobile will not fit your crib if your top rail is any bigger than about 3 and 3/4 inches tall.I have the Babyletto Mercer crib, and the top rail is just about 1/4" too tall for the mobile.It is too bad because it is a wonderful mobile - I loved the bright colors, adorable animals, leaf movement, and musical choices (though the rainforest one was especially quiet).We originally bought this mobile in 2007 for our now 3yr old daughter, she LOVED it so much that we left it up until she could unscrew it from the crib (about 15mths).The music is perfect for soothing very soft & slow and the motion is engaging enough to grab their attention but subtle enough to lull them to sleep.Even after being in use that long it was still in great condition so we took it out for our son (2 months old) but he does not appear to be a fan.Possibly he'll like it as he gets older but for now even the soft music & motion is too stimulating for him and gets him worked up rather then soothed.This mobile works great.Both the music and the bright colorful animals get and hold our son's attention and he still enjoys it after 9 months.My baby enjoyed this mobile.But after about 3 months of not-too-heavy use, the motor started making a whirring noise, and would struggle to turn.We didn't put this on the crib until my son was about 2 months old.The lights, movement & sounds all help calm & put my son to sleep.I love when he does that since it gives us an extra bit of time to get up & get a bottle ready for him.The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think it could be improved upon a little.This is a wonderful item to have in your nursery.This is a great gift idea for a baby shower.Calm sounds, gentle motions and easy colors soothe baby and lull him to sleep.Cute scenery, nice music, and not too bright lights.Its nice that it has different settings so you can adjust the music, lights, and sound to change it up.I received this as a gift for my baby shower.The blue light is great since it gives just enough light to see what I'm doing but not too much that it will wake up daddy.The music it plays is great as well since it puts my son right too sleep.This toy puts my son into a trance and calms him down when he's fusy at bed time.I love it as wellI bought this as a crib toy, since that is how it is advertised.However, I found it to be much too bright when I used it as such.He loves to play with it, turns it on and sways to the music, watches the monkey swing and really seems to enjoy it, but it doesn't work as intended.This is a fantastic little crib distraction, I can leave my son in his crib now for almost 10 minutes!I just wish it lasted longer, I think it is a great device, however if it could last about 15-20 minutes, that would be amazing!fun bubbles, and moving objects inside, with fun up beat music, not for sleeping!definitely for an awake babay as the light inside is pretty bright too.My 1,5 year old turns on this soother herself when I forget to.Great music and sounds, very well made, lots to look at so very entertaining for a child.The quality is good, although after a while the fish stopped moving :) You can choose from different settings for music, light and volume.You can choose to play music or sounds without any light on.I bought this as a Valentine's present for my 4-month old daughter.You can't tell online but there are nice details to the doll, like smooth satin ribbon hair (2 locks on top) and other satin textures on the outfit for baby to feel.I waited a long time to buy this because while cute, I didn't think it was "anything special" but it truly is adorable and has nice details ... definitely high quality and worth the money.Although I have not given it to her yet, I can tell you I am in LOVE with it!Very soft material, bright colors.ADORABLE!This would be a perfect baby shower gift.I'm sure my friend's little girl will love it.I bought this doll when my daughter was a year old and she liked it!I rated it four stars just because it's not her favorite toy, but the quality is excellent.I loved this doll, I bought this for my daughter for christmas who was a little over 4 months.I knew she wouldn't play with it for a while.She is now 8 months and still hasn't touched it.It doesn't make noise or anything so it doesn't catch her attention.I used it on her diaper cake for her baby shower and it really added to the fun of it.We nicknamed out son "peanut" since he was so small when he was born and I hit the jackpot with this toy!Like the other reviewer said- I don't understand why this isn't popular either!It is adorable!!!Very soft, very "huggable", love the taggies for the hair and the satin pieces on the clothing for a tactile difference.My son loves him too!The Peanut Doll is primary colors- perfect for a boy.Dolls are great toys for young children (and babies) since it aids emotional development and this toy is perfect for that job!This seat was on sale and we thought it was nice to have something that had some fancy features- the music is great, it becomes a stool too, and it has a lid we can put down just for cleanliness (which also made it look more like the adult potty too!).All this distracts him from going to the bathroom and he's already pinched his privates too.I tried to teach him to push down the guard and his weewee, but let's just say that touching himself was also distracting (TMI?- boys will be boys!).My big boy about had the wire frame of his bouncy seat bent all the way back at 6 weeks but was still far too young for more upright chairs.I was so happy when I found this.I also like all the positions I can put him in with it, I know it will continue to be a good piece of baby furniture for us into the future.I really like the toy bar on this too.No kidding, my baby absolutely loves this rocker/chair.because she sleeps very comfortable in it.I also love the colors, they are bright and fun!!It's so comfortable for my 5 month old.I found this rocker to be very helpful to put my son to sleep when he was a newborn, the rocking motion was comforting and strapping him in there and letting him sleep on it was a life saver.The vibrating motion I felt was not helpful, you do not want to get your kid used to that, or you're in trouble at bed time... in my opinion anyway.The straps on the back of it to make it more upright are a great idea, however I wish it would have had more fabric to make it lean back back more.I'd also would have loved it if the rocker when fully extended was a bit higher of the ground and adjustable with some type of a locking feature so the extentions did not stick out.Minor issues I still love this rocker and I am definitely keeping it for the next one.My grandson loved this teether when he first got it but doesn't use it much anymore.Well, it didn't work on my tv stand.Unlike the picture, the inside piece needs to be pushed back a couple of inches in order for the door to close all the way.These are great.These also help keep our cabinets closed as some of the original catches aren't fully functional anymore.Also, these only work face up and they don't fit shallower drawers so they won't work on everything but they are still great.OK, so my wife and I went nuts with these and bought 19 packages (76 locks).Anyway, after installing this many locks, I know all of the pros and cons.With that positioning, our son can pull the door open just far enough to pinch fingers and hands, even though the door is locked on top.It would be nice if the lock could be positioned somewhere other than the top, but this is not how it is designed.2.Unforgiving Adhesive: You must have a steady hand when working with the adhesive on these locks.I dropped one of the locks when installing it with the adhesive exposed.I have serious doubts as to whether the lock will stand up to his pulling.The adhesive may be easier and quicker than using screws for installation, but the integrity of the hold is definitely compromised.If you plan to try these locks, I would recommend purchasing just 1 package (4 locks).Then, try them out on a variety of cabinets before you go hog wild like we did.You may find, as we did, that they are not all that great.Works well as advertised and relatively easy to install.I just love this locks!!I have a 1 year old and he opens ALL the cabinets.. we bought this magnet lock and they are SOO good!!Not that easy to put on because you really have to measure exactly each end so it fits perfect!I hope some of you come back and read this because this is by far the BEST cup I have tried with my baby.Okay so for you who do not know, there are 3 main parts to this cup.YAY!Okay, I hope this helps some of you.Most importantly, it keeps my 14 month old our of the cabinets and drawers.I have an aggressive little one so it always locks when pulled.They are such a great price (compared to most of the other options that I saw 5 months ago).You just have to get it precise.A millimeter or two off and it won't work smoothly.I got these locks when my daughter was about a year old.She was able to open three of the other locks I tried, but not these!!They work great at keeping her out, she tried almost every day to figure them out with no luck yet and she is almost two now :-)There are a cpl things that I don't like about these locks... My husband still doesn't understand how they work!!!I read the reviews on all of the drawer locks and finally decided upon this one.Yes, I knew it said the drawer would remain open a bit if pulled to prevent little fingers from getting pinched...but I didn't realize it would be open as much as it is.I do like the fact that he can't pinch his fingers, but he can still reach in the drawer and get little things out once he has it partially opened because it locks into that position.They were not easy to install either.I couldn't use the extra piece that allows you to use the disable feature, so they are always on and always being a pain.One in my pack was cracked also, so I only got to use 5 versus all 6 (this wasn't factored into my 3 stars).Overall, an OK lock...but I'm looking for a different one already.I can't stand how the drawers lock being open 2"-3" allowing my little one to dig in and get things out...what is the point??They are still firmly attached to the doors and work well.My now 4.5 year old can open these easily but they are still great for keeping my almost 2 year old contained.It is funny, they seem to be adult-proof, though.Most adults who visit us struggle to figure these out!It comes out of the dishwasher with white crust that won't come off.I started using these for my 7 month old.The new bowls have an attached suction bottom, and I just love them!The lids go on and click audibly so you know they've closed, and they are easily opened by an adult.They are instantly removable by our son (14 mo.)and unsuction without his help after about a minute of not being touched.The suction doesn't seem to work that great though.We bought them specifically for use on our coffee table and my son seems to get them off with hardly any effort at all.Trust me, I have bought them all!We got these when my daughter was learning to use a spoon/fork and she was having issues with her plate/bowl moving around on her.I love that the suction cup is wide and stable, even if it's not suctioned down.The small and medium are great, perfect.It's nice and soft but unfortunately, didn't fit the pad I bought for the changing table.I have the Summer Infant contoured changing pad, and it fits perfectly -- EXCEPT for the straps.If you do plan on using straps and don't mind your baby having to lay down on part of the strap, no issues.If you want the straps to fit snugly across your baby, you'll have issues once your baby is more than 6" wide.UPDATE: We've been using this for almost 9 months now, with frequent washings, and it's still just as soft and plush as when I first bought it.The American Baby Company's Heavenly Soft Chenille Contoured Changing Table Cover is perfectly soft for baby's skin.It is fitted and fits perfectly on the Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad.It makes for a great all day/ travel bag, It's comfortable to carry and easy to find your things.At this point, my only cons are that it is a bit bulky to carry for quick trips where you'd rather have something smaller that "looks" like a purse.I bought this bag on the premise that I wanted my hubs to be comfortable enough to carry it (unisex) but I would rather have something more "girly" since I'm more likely to use it than the hubs.Very pleased with this backpack diaper bag.You can actually stay organized and not have to dig down to the bottom.We recieved this back pack today, and we LOVE IT.i have 1.5 year old and 3.5 year old and all their stuff fits there, pluss most of our stuff.I love having the wipes built in and easy accessable.My husband loves it too.Nice quality and the color is great.I purchased this because my baby jogger summit XC doesn't come with a parent tray.It fits perfectly on the handlebars and doesn't interfere with the hand brake.It is a little difficult to find a water bottle that fits in the cup holder (a regular one, like poland springs, fits fine, but I had to try a couple reusable ones before I found one that fit).I love the middle storage space.I originally used it for key, wallet and cell phone, but then figured out it fits my son's handled sippy cup perfectly.Now I put my stuff in the front pocket and his sippy cup in the holder.This does the job, without looking cheep.It's velcrow is very sturdy, and I walk A LOT, and it's never even budged.Happy I bought it:)I love this since the Phil and Teds did not have a cup holder.This is a good one and has lots of space.I prefer it over the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy, because it has 2 more straps, so its more secure, and a covered, zippered compartment, instead of an open one.Quality seems good, but I've only had it a month.The cup holders are not large enough to fit larger coffee cups or even larger water bottles.I bought this for my Phil&Ted;'s Dash stroller.This pillow is fantastic.It does help with that, but even more so, it is so comfortable!I read some reviews that the pillow case was scratchy, but I have no problem with it (and I have sensitive skin).I put this over the body pillow where my head is, so that I just have to wash that, not the whole giant pillow case.Our only complaint is that it's a bit loud and you do need quite a bit of bubbles in it for it to work, but once you get enough bubbles in there....watch out.It creates a TON of bubbles!It's so fun to watch!I bought this for my 9 month old son because he really likes bubbles.We hated it.This is a great space saver and dries fast.Seems comfortable for baby.Love the colorful lids and containers - fun for kids and nice to look at.They are easy to mix and match.The size is not too big and not too small - just right!They stack neatly in the fridge and stores nicely.easy to clean, adjust straps and seems comfortable enough for my baby eventhough it has little padding.I like the design of this brush as far as how well it cleans large bottles and that it has a seperate nipple brush.The price is also very reasonable.I thought this might be the case with just one brush, but it happened to all the ones that I bought.Awesome step stool.Kudos Nuby.I love this item my little one use it all the time.But I recommend this step stool, very sturdy.It doesn't matter which way my daughter picks it up, she's able to chew on any and every part of this teether.I think that when your baby has enough teeth it could be possible to chew off a piece.This teether is the only one that my four-month old son will chew on for any length of time.The berry, however, is great because he can fit it in his mouth and keep it there a bit, and he is also able to hold it by the stem by himself.It's easy for me to keep in his mouth when he is really cranky, too.Some people have commented that it is too big for their baby's mouth, but my son is a big boy and he never had a problem fitting it in there.When my first child wouldn't take a pacifier, and seemed to turn up his nose at traditional teethers I was desperate.The size was perfect (started around three months), and I think the nubby texture felt nice on his gums (he had his first tooth at four months).Sometimes I even stuck this in the fridge for a little while and he had something nice and cool to chew on.This and the Mam teethers were mainstays for us throughout the teething process.I personally prefer this one until baby has a better grip-it's easier for parent or child to hold onto, and even goes on those little loops  to keep pacifiers safe.The only negative is the handle-not quite as sturdy as the est of the pacifier, and on one it did pull apart.I bought this for my 6 month old who is teething horribly.He absolutely loves it.The trick is keeping it away from my 19 month old who is working on her 2 year molars.She loves it just as much as he does.Definitely worth the purchase!***UPDATE 12/19/2010***Well I bit the bullet and had to purchase more of these awesome teethers.I love this teether.Instructions did not state.The berry part is very big and barely fits in my 5 month old's mouth.she just kept trying to suck on it and would get frustrated when she couldnt.We have three so my son (5 months) can always have one with him.he just love this teether.the texture is very nice and easy for him to chew.It's so easy for him to hold too.make it easy for me because I don't have to keep picking the teether up from the floor.Great teether that really soothes.He can carry it around in his mouth (chewing on it while he moves) and can get the teether back to his molars, unlike most other teethers.The texture of it seems to really massage and comfort his gums.This is the ONE teether must-have that I will get for all my babies to come!!Not sure if it is just my baby girl but she wants nothing to do with this teether.It is actually a cool little teether and seems like it would have been a hit with all teething babes but she actually prefers to chew and gnaw on her toys rather than take a binkie or pacifier/teether.However, the teether is only a couple of bucks so it may be worth trying.I thought it would be a nice texture for my daughter to chomp on during her teething but she really could care less for it.I think the problem is that the raspberry part is too big/fat and it doesn't fit comfortably in her mouth.She actually chews more on the ring/handle and leaves than she does the actual raspberry!this thing is awesome.plus, it's adorable.This is great for young babies who can't quite manipulate the bigger teethers yet.I was wrong, she really enjoys pulling it in and out of her mouth and chewing on the leaves!I love this Teether!Bought it for my son when he was 2 months old (he started teething very early) and he didn't like it too much...he chewed on it for a little bit but I had to hold it since he couldn't yet.Then around 3 months old when he could hold objects himself and bring them to his mouth he LOVED it!If your baby doesn't love it at first, try try try again ( =And since I bought two I gave one to my puppy (for her birthday lol)...she loves it too and it is still in great shape, even with a DOG chewing on it for 2+ months now!Still totally intact.My son loved this!He loves it!The teether was a bit large for his mouth when we first got it, but he chewed all the other parts happily.I bought this for my 3 1/2 month old that started teething early.I read all the reviews before I started shopping for teething items and it's true, this one will be your favorite.She would gnaw and chew on it all the time, the loop, the sides of it, she loved chewing on the whole thing.I guess she was attached to that particular one because I bought another one, exactly the same, and she won't use it!My son loves his razberry.I love it too cause he doesn't bite everything in sight when he has it.HE LOVES IT!!For the reviews that state that this is too big for baby's mouth, well this is not a regular pacifier... this is a TEETHER with a pacifier shape =) so size really doesn't matter.This is the best teething relief I've found for him (I didn't want to use medecine all the time)I ordered 3 more =)Our infant will not take a pacifier, but loves to chew on these while teething.So adorable too!The RaZ-berry teethers are chunky enough for babies to grasp and manipulate easily.The "fruit" is bumpy enough to feel good on sore gums, but not too rough to cause pain.Both the handle and the "leaves" also have raised sections that our baby loves to chew on.When refrigerated, they maintain their softness/pliability.The bonus: it is shaped like a pacifier, so babies can suck on it and it fits comfortably in their mouths.I completely recommend the light blue, considering that is the one I bought for my baby boy.It is a very nice color, just as shown in the picture, and it is only about fifty cents more than the original "raZ-berry teether".So, if you really want the contrast in colors, you can take the risk with one of the dual-color raz-berry teethers; Many people have been more than happy with the those and never had a problem with it coming apart.My son likes this teether.This is my son's favorite teether.And it doesn't matter if he doesn't get the raspberry part in, the "leaves" are just as good for chewing on as far as he is concerned!She keeps wanting to suck the teether like a pacifier rather than chew on it for her gums.It keeps them organized and in order.This organizer is much larger than I thought, I'm glad we have a large fridge because it takes up quite a bit of room!But I love it.I haven't tried the first years bags, but the lanisoh ones fit perfectly!It's all I wanted, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's bulkier than the other options we've come up with since purchasing this.We can't devote an entire freezer to breastmilk, and after filling this container very quickly, we took the lid off and filled the lid (worked nicely, dual duty).I love this organizer.There's even a panel inside as well to keep between frozen and fresh milk so you don't risk partially thawing your frozen supply.And I love that I can flip the lid upside down and use it for extra storage.NOTE: I've found that the First Years bags are actually a teeny bit wider than the organizer.Its soo easy to use our 3 year old opens it for me so I can dispose of the diapers.We use their True Fit carseat and LOVE it.So, it does its job in that way....What fan?It is far too top-heavy to stay standing while the lid is flipped open.With respect to the lid being loud - it is only loud if you snap it shut with force.If you simply push the lid down gently, it barely makes a sound; the same goes for opening it.The disposal filter system works great.It is very easy to use and VERY QUIET.I have had friends and family with babies of their own admire my disposal over the genies that they have.I never heard a fan sound or anything like that.These really do a great job of keeping the wipes warm and moist.I don't use these Ever-Fresh Pillows inside thePrince Lionheart Premium Wipe Warmeranymore.Instead, I wet one of the square wipes that came with the Lionheart Warmer and use it as a makeshift moistening pillow by placing it on the bottom of the warmer, where the pillow should go.When I go through a round of wipes, I replace the "moistening wipe" on the bottom of the warmer, too--which, by that point, usually has a bit of brown crust, but not too much--with a clean wipe.They worked great, keeping my cloth wipes moist and warm between diaper changes.However, my family recently moved to the Midwest, and I have had to stop using the pillows.For some reason, after about a day in the wipe warmer, these pillows become hard, and a brown crust (which looks like rust) starts forming on the side of the pillow closest to the warmer.I have tried everything I can think of to prevent that crust from forming, but nothing has worked.I finally started just not using the pillow at all, and things have been fine.I don't know what is in the pillow or what is in my water (gross), but something is reacting with something else to form some serious nastiness.I had alot of issues with my cloth wipes getting dried out, and it turns out the pad was absorbing all the moisture.Our wipes warmer is still working great.I also have friends that you use cloth diapers and wipes and the wipe warmer and refills work well for the cloth wipes too.I am very pleased with the wipes warmer and the replacement pillows!We love our warmer - the pads last about a month or two, depending on if we remember to re-wet them each week!The wipes have never dried out in this warmer.I love the wipe warmer but it has some issues.I would not have any counter space at all if I did not have this!fits on all counter tops!i have used this for almost 2 years and love it so much!i give it as a baby shower gift to other parents to be.good bottle brush.sturdy bristles.flexible enough to fit into most bottles.And it was really easy to put together.For those, it works wonderfully well.You can keep a steady stream of dry bottles coming off as you replace them with freshly washed ones--there is plenty of storage for a large number of bottles, components, and nipples.My wife especially likes that the rack keeps everything organized without taking up too much room on our kitchen counter.Pros:Easy to set-upWell organizedInexpensiveLarge number of storage optionsCons:Doesn't work for glass bottlesConclusions:Recommended for anyone using plastic bottles.I got this as a gift and I never would have registered for it but now I can't live without it, especially since I'm a chronic sterilizer.This keeps bottles and tiny parts separate from everything else in the kitchen...I only wish it looked a little neater.But it works great w/ plastic bottles and all the tiny parts to go with my breastpump.Great price too!I have 2 month old twins boys.I have had this dryer rack for about 4 months now and use it daily.Most of the time the bottles end up stored on it on the kitchen counter.I am giving it 4 stars because it is exactly what i needed, reasonably priced and it can store A TON of pacifiers, bottles, nipples, food jars, caps etc.I would have liked it to be a little more sturdy, but overall works well and met my expectations.The turning is a nice feature to access space.I didn't try it with any other bottles but only with the "First Years" bottles!!I liked having a separate rack because it was easy to get to all the bottle parts.It also did not take up a lot of space.Once he was done with the bottles, I continued to use it to dry sippy cups.Now I have a second child on the way and will continue to use this rack.Didn't give it a five star because I find that some of the pegs don't fit in tightly.However, I have not had it fallen off once an item is already on there.Not a big deal to me.The top moves fine.Highly recommended.Love it!I use it for over a month and love it!This drying rack has great drying capacity and does not take a lot of counter space.The top layer spins just fine.I cannot believe this has been rated so well.It's really really really not worth the purchase.I use this item daily to dry my bottles, but that's about it.Also, the "spin" part of it, well, I just don't really call that spinning.It's easier just to pick it up and turn it IMPO.This is one of the few items I will probably toss out after my son is out of bottle and just get something better next child.the knobs, although advertised as fitting most ranges (which could very well be true) do not fit my oven knobs.We bought this for my daughter to use on a road trip and it works very well.It lays on my son's legs and he fusses and tries to push it off -- he fights with it until I eventually give up and take it off.It's now laying around collecting dust, and I'm hoping to try again when my son is older so I get my money's worth.To be honest, it is way overpriced!We're happy with this changing table.It was easy to assemble and did not have any defects.This changer is great.It is very sturdy, safety is of first concern.Secondly it is beautiful.At 5'7" it is at the perfect height for me to change my daughter.This product gets my thumbs up because:1.will hold more stuff than you think2.keeps stuff wicked cool3.great straps for clicking to stroller or hooking to diaper bag4.Perfect for the afternoon outing.Probably not a day trip kind of bag.6.Would work GREAT for keeping personal medical supplies cold for the day.*does not fit standard size Dr. Browns bottles.This is the best bottle for my 1 year old.Of course it's not as leak proof as a sippy cup though.I highly recommend these!My three month old loves looking at these pictures.I've tried them in his crib and alongside the changing table and he seems mesmerized by the contrasting pictures.They are a little noisy and do leave some marks on my son's legs, but he never seemed to be bothered or uncomfortable.I agree with others that you should wash these by hand to help them last.All in all, they are great for the price.My son just used pull-ups like diapers and was not having potty success, he was almost 3.My mother told me how she used rubber pants to potty train us.I have a changing table with a smaller space and this worked perfectly.Love this changing pad and the Summer Infant Naturally Yours Changing Table Cover (sold on Amazon) fits perfectly!I highly recommend this cover to go with this pad; I tried others that were suggested and had to send them back b/c they were too small (b/c of the length created by the sides at either end -- the Summer Infant cover is 37 in.The pad is great -- high quality and fits my antique dresser just as I had hoped.It's as advertised.It holds my squirming active baby.I do not use it with a changing table though, I just place it on my bathroom counter.I am using a dresser top as a changing table and have not been able to find a changing pad to fit it till I found this one, which fits perfectly!It seems very soft and safe for the baby with the round contouring all the way around the pad, and not just on the 2 sides.I am not sure how a regular changing pad cover will fit yet, but I am sure it won't be anything bad enough to change my mind about how awesome it is.I've been using this changing pad for 14 months now and after 12 months it got a tear at one end most likely from kicking baby feet.I'm not too surprised because it gets so much use.I never used the strap because it sits secure without it.I haven't used it for a changing pad yet.I use it for the counter space next to the sink to wash my LO's hair.This pad fits perfectly on our dresser.We had to get this one based on size because our dresser is smaller than the other changing pads.The pad is constructed well and the cover we bought for it fits perfect.With her tummy still relatively large and will remain so for the next few weeks, our son rests on the inside edge of the Boppy pillow.This can be rather painful when he falls out of position, which is very often.Our pediatrician recommended MyBrestFriend pillow to us.We've used that for a few days now, and that one is much better for us because of the square edge vs the round edge on Boppy.I initially bought this to use while nursing my baby and while it's a nice pillow it just was not useful for me while breastfeeding.I tried to use it many times while nursing but my son would just roll off the rounded edges of the pillow and end up between my stomach and the pillow.I love this pillow for the fact that it's so comfortable for my daughter!It's so easy to use and wonderful to put her down in when we're hanging out in the living room.Such a space saver!My back was killing me from breastfeeding, and after asking around, most of my friends suggested I buy the Boppy pillow.I only wish I has bought is sooner.My back no longer aches.But after having one for my second baby, I absolutely HAD to have one with my third.It really makes nursing more comfortable, especially when you have a newborn doing "marathon" nursing sessions.It makes holding a baby so much easier.I had to have an emergency C-Section and the boppy made it very simple for me to hold our new son while my abdomen healed from the surgery.I don't think I could have made it through the first 6 weeks of healing if it weren't for this pillow.i used this pillow from day 1 at the hospital to feed my son.i'm sure it will be even more helpful once my son gets heavier.(well, I wouldn't have wanted to anyway) Now that the baby and I are more experienced at breastfeeding, I don't NEED my boppy, but I definitely prefer to have it.I use it constantly to breastfeed and to lay my son in when he wants to watch tv.We ended up getting the Natural Boost Adjustable Nursing Pillow by Leachco, which was FANTASTIC!My son is now 2yrs old and we STILL can use it for so many things!It has a bolster pillow that is also velcro'd on and you can flip it to either side, or move it under you or you can take it off.I wash it 1X a week and for 2yrs there is no rips, tears or anything.I just wish they came in more colors!Leachco Natural Boost - Adjustable Nursing Pillow - DenimThis is probably the one item that I used EVERY single day- multiple times a day.But that's ok- because it's comfortable as a neck pillow too!We love this and will never use any other nursing pillow.But it has many other valuable uses.My son hated tummy time on the floor and his head was getting flat, so we laid him belly down in our laps on the boppy, which he loved.I love our boppy!!I can see people loving this for nursing.However, if you are like me, don't despair if you have a boppy and are not using it.On your baby registry is a perfect way to get this pillow with out feeling guilty for dropping coin on something you may or may not use.When I opened the package, the cheap quality was apparent.I think it maybe uncomfortable for my baby's delicate mouth.For the cheap price, if you are looking for a nice sippy cup, these are definately worth trying.If you have any questions, let me know and I'll try to help you out : )I would go with the NUK beginner sippy cups.I love this.It's so great to have your stroller out of the way.I purchased this for my 7 month old grand baby after purchasing a couple other items similar.This is great, and it has the lights that I was hoping for on the top.I really liked the concept of this toy so I bought it for my son for xmas last year, he was only 4 months at the time and has really only recently been playing with it now at 13 months old.blue + red makes purple).Already the "purple" doesnt work, it doesnt say the colour, light up or sing.. nothing.I was not very happy about this since it was purchased less than a year ago.I like that fact that it is not very stuffed and it is the softest material I have ever felt.It is definetly cuddly lovie material.Bought this for my 10 month old, wish I would have gotten at 5 months!I like that the clip part doesn't seem to overly obstruct his mouth when he's sleeping.Oh my, it was working instantly!She now prefers a big blanket, not a blankie.She loves it too!All three of my kids have Bunnies By the Bay lovies and they are fantastic.My son loves it!Perfect for a little boy!However, I'm giving 2 stars as I expected to receive various design of Winnie the Pooh like the photo shown but ending up getting one design for all 50 counts.I LOVE these placemats.We go out to eat frequently and these are a lifesaver in a restaurant.I bought it for the non-diaper baggy design and the decidedly androgynous color scheme.I have also used it while hiking so as not to ruin my nicer, more expensive bags.Pros:-The colors!It's waterproof, wipe-able, compact, the handle is a great length, it folds out to a decent sized changing pad, and it has a little zipper pocket that holds a sanitizing hand wipe packet, my license, and some cash perfectly.-It's nicely sized for a day bag.-The zipper is smooth.-Lots of useful pockets.Cons:-There is a round magnet that holds the front cover closed, and it kind of shows through the fabric.Sorry, it's true.The narrow Evenflo bottles are a bit loose and the wider Playtex Drop-Ins are very tight.The changing pad thing is awesome and well worth the money if you can buy it separately.I bought this bag after a friend told me that the reviews must be crazy because she thought it was awesome.The compartments are nice, but I feel like the changing pad doesn't fit well in its designated pocket once filled with diapers (which is how it's designed to work).We have been going out with the twins for over 3 months now.I think any twin's parent would enjoy using it and the price is certainly right.It is long natuarally because it inhibits twins.We have been using this stroller for 5 months with our twins and we love it.We just got a double Maclaren umbrella stroller for the next stage, and it doesn't fold up as easily as this one.We'll miss it when the twins outgrow their car seats.Key positives:--extremely easy to open and close; takes hardly any time and you can do it with just one hand--light, folds down very compactly--good storage space beneath--steering/turning is very smooth--two cup holders--durable frameI also highly recommend getting a "mommy hook" to go with this stroller.At last count I had purchased 23 different kinds of sippy cup for my child before finding one he likes.This type is *our* favorite.My son is breastfed and had no interest in a bottle and so we're weaning directly to a cup.Primarily this cup.Also, if the lid isn't on perfectly this cup drips.The second one we bought did the same.I was rapt to see these online because they looked identical to one I had already.However, these straws seem to need my 1 year old to compress (i.e.My 13 month old loves drinking from cups with straws so I thought these looked perfect.PROS: When I tried to switch my son to bottles, it took a few months of frustration before I found these.Months of this went by, making zero progress, and then I bought him a cup with a straw to try out.He loved it.I use a bottle brush for the bottom part and lid.The bottle brush cleans out the bottle just fine, but the lid is full of nooks and crannies.The straw will discolor when dark juice is used (even though I water it down a great deal) and so the straw is stained.You just have to twist it through, and give it a little tug.When it was new it didn't, but the valve inside the straw cracks a little right away, and so it leaks if the cup is left on its side (or upside down in the diaper bag).If you have the lid closed the leaking isn't really an issue.I wasn't aware that it was any kind of choking hazard (like it says on the page).My son is pretty destructive and has had it since he was about 9 months old (he is over a year old now), and it hasn't ever been an issue.The cups have been dropped many (many, many) times and one of them did break when it hit the floor, and the cup had only been used a few times.Adult finger fits inside nipple, so you can gently encourage baby to start sucking to lull themselves to sleep.My baby loves these pacifiers.That was until a friend told us they had a similar dilema and bought us a pack to try out.She absolutely loves them!They are perfect hold overs for until she really wants to eat.These pacifiers are one piece and without the plastic guard.These are NEWBORN PACIFIERS as stated on the package.If your child is sucking her thumb(or mittens, sleeves, blankie, what have you) then she/he is  either hungry or wants comfort.A pacifier is a great way to comfort or help increase her appetite(we used these to increase her appetite and get her in the habit of sucking so she would eat more) but should not be used simply as a distraction so you don't have to deal with them.Lastly, people say these are ugly as sin.may not be the cutest looking but does a great job.My lactation consultant recommends this pacifier because, as she says, "It's round."I'm having a LOT of nipple issues in my breastfeeding, so when my daughter started wanting to suck for soothing, I decided to go with my lactation consultant's recommendation and use the soothie.I had some of the same falling-out issues that other parents are reporting, but I got around them with a few days of practicing the following:1) Tickle her nose to get her to open up wide for a latch2) Hold the pacifier in place until she really latches on well3) Once she's got a good grip, tug gently and steadily on the pacifier to get her to suck harder and fight your pull.)It really does roll into far-off places when it falls on the floor.It takes a bit of investment.It's not the easiest pacifier out there.On the other hand, if it helps her to keep her tongue down and treat my poor, cracked, sore nipples gently, then I'm all for it.This is the only pacifier that has a "natural" shaped nipple.Babies who are breastfeed are typically not going to like pacifiers that do not feel like the mother's breast.This pacifier is HUGE and the top of the pacifier constantly hits her nose.I don't know how big of a mouth the previous reviewer's baby has but there is NO possible way my baby at 5 months could get this pacifier into her mouth.I think their experience was rare and not the norm!The search continues but this one definitely is not the one.The softer soothies work like a charm though.When I was prego I bought EVERY kind of ortho pacifiers for my soon to be baby boy.As soon as we lost one or couldn't give one to my son when he needed it, the world literally would end.This was a peace offering to calm a very tyrannical baby.If your baby has a hard time drinking out of them (or just wouldn't latch (like my son did - avent, maam, medela, gerber, nuk) then get their bottles.Same nipple shape and comes in 2 different sizes.TEETH:My son is almost 2 now and I was scared that because these were ortho pacis, that he'd have buck teeth or just out of line.I bought these because so many babies love them but my son hates these.Not to mention that they are huge on his little face.I get around it by turning it on while my son sleeps in my arms and then laying him down in it.It offers a classical mix or nature sounds.That being said, I probably would purchase this swing again because I like how deep the seat is.It's like a secure little bowl...I never strap him in and have no worries about him falling out.Obviously, I use this primarily for naptime.Had this for 3 months now, my baby lives in it she loves it so much.I registered for this and received it as a gift because I thought I just needed a playard with a bassinet.It's great and easy to put together and take apart.It'll be great for travel and it's pretty compact when folded up.I just wished I registered for a pack 'n play with a changer now though!!!They have so many different pack 'n plays in all sorts of designs and colors!I ordered this playyard in lively dots because it was such a great price.Great for a boy or a girl.It appears to be sturdy, it is a nice size and was an absolute breeze to set up (super-duper easy).This is also extremely easy to fold up and is quite compact which will make it useful when traveling.It is great, and I'm so happy with our purchase.The price is sweet too!**update 8 months later**Our baby slept in this bassinet for the first 4 months of her life.She loved it and so did we.It was great having her so close by and the bassinet isn't so huge that it takes up a ton of room.How many of you have gotten ouchies from a pack `n play ?This was the bassinet that I chose after reading many many many many MANY reviews on all kinds of bassinets and their pros and cons and whatnot.. and the price, simplicity, and the positive reviews appealed to me so I purchased it.Well first of all it was a nice gender neutral color and the design and pictures on it were absolutely adorable and not offensive at all.and the set up was quick and easy and folding up for storage was do-able.I set it up in the room with even a canopy hanging over it to create the new baby atmosphere and also to protect my coming baby from flying insects and stuff..I speak in past tense because a few months later while getting my car transported it was stolen out of my trunk.Well I ended up never using it from the beginning.It pretty much held diapers and other stuff I wanted for immediate access since it was propped right up next to my bed.. and it was GREAT for that.When one of the sides became permanently locked and one of the bars on the changing table broke, we knew it was time to shop around.A friend had loaned us a fancier Graco model and I was able to set it up by myself in about 8-10 minutes (including all of the accessory pieces).So we decided to go with this model b/c of it's simplicity and I thought the pattern was super cute.It is super simple to use, the mattress fits very snugly into the frame, and our baby sleeps as comfortably in this as she does her own crib at home.I highly recommend this PnP!Love it.We used this in our room as a "bassinet" because we figured, someday, we'd need this when we traveled.It's lightweight, easy to put together, and sturdy.We love it so much we bought one on Amazon and sent it to my parent's house, since we will be visiting often.It's cheaper than bringing this one and checking it in multiple times - that $25 checked bag fee is spendy!I bought this for my parents house in case baby would like to sleep when we go over there...It is very easy to assemble and move all around the house because of the wheels.Also, it seems very sturdy and my baby sleeps like a baby when he's inside... great price too!My only regret, that I did not get one for our first son.I believe that the basic model is all you need.This is the 4th stroller I have owned, now being on my third child and I love this stroller.It is lightweight for a double stroller, easy to maneuver, slender, and fits easily into my Nissan Pathfinder.I also own a Graco Quattro Tour, a Chico umbrella stroller, a Peg Perego Pliko.PROS:- Lightweight - This stroller weighs as much as the Graco Quattro Tour single stroller, which I also own.As a result, the DuoGlider is easy to push and easy to lift into the back of my SUV without assistance.- Ample Room for Both Kids - The DuoGlider is actually longer than many other double strollers, giving each child ample room.I have seen other stroller models that give the child in the back seat almost no leg room.- Good View for Both Kids - I purchased this stroller for an 18-month-old and a newborn, and I like the fact that either child can ride in either seat.I would highly recommend.The only aspect I don't like is the tray.I bought mine from diapers.com and was very happy.If you use the code BAIL2798 you can get 20% off your whole purchase from all their sites.Amazon also has good deals sometimes.Rather than just a "U" or bowl shape, it has a rim all around and then another raised part, so when you dump the contents, you then have to deal with what has been splattered all over this ledge.The size is fine for us, but as I said, our daughter is 11 months.It then proceeds to smell, and that's especially if you try to wash it since it soaks up the yucky stuff with the water you're washing it with.2) The opening of the potty and the way it's designed make it so that my son can't poop in it without getting poop on the back of the seat.It's making him hesitant to poop at all and he's currently holding it when he has to go.Very frustrating.3) The pee guard works well, but again because of the size and positioning of the seat, it rubs up against my son's "stuff" and I'm sure that can't be too comfortable.Before we actually started potty training and were using this as a step stool, it was great.My son is 13 months old, and I bought him the "3-in-1" potty just to have it around until he was ready to use it (the box says 18 months).The seat is much too small, and I believe the other reviewers who said it soaks up urine.It doesn't happen every time I wash them, but I've already lost 3.Perfect to feed a small baby.Highly recommend!My daughter likes the colors and at 6 months was wanting to feed herself with them.they flip out of them.These spoons are soft and in playful colors.baby has not used them yet but we've used them a few times and they work great.good grip.My little man has been using these for the last 2 months and they seem to work great.They are small enough to where you can't put too much food on them.I am able to put them into the dishwasher and they wash up nicely.I wish they had these when I had my first child, these spoons are wonderful.It has a nice scoop to it, it is the perfect spoon.My 4 month old eats out of them perfectly.Great value for the price, as well.Just started to feed our infant solids.They are also soft and feels very pliable - perfect for little mouths just starting to learn how to put their lips over the spoons.It is the perfect depth to get the right amount of baby food for baby.I love the bright colors.I had to order a second set (see below), and they've held up well through daily use with a teething baby who likes to try to chew on them.My first impression was that the spoon was too deep to get the food out.They were the first spoons that I used when starting my 4 month old son on cereal and vegetables.At first I was concerned that they wouldn't be soft enough and that I should have gone with the classic, thickly coated spoons but these were wonderful!He doesn't have any complaints, they hold plenty of food, and the colors are cute!Everything about these are perfect!Perfect for first foods.They'd get a higher rating from me but you just don't use these small spoons for too long a period of time before moving on to a spoon with a wider tip.Nevertheless you can't start out with the wider tipped spoons you need to go gradually so these really are necessary, good thing they're cheap.Although they are not the colors pictured, I like the bright colors of the spoons and so does my son.They catch his attention easily.The size holds just the right amount of food and the shape helps it stay in without spilling.If the point was just rounded a bit more, I believe that these spoons would be better balanced, and, in my opinion, it would make these the ideal baby/toddler spoons.These hold more food, but since they are deeper, he can't always get all the food off of them.I've been very happy with both, depending on my mood and the type of food.-Deep enough to hold very runny first foods compared to the shallow Gerber spoons.-The lip is rounded enough that it doesn't scratch baby's chin/face when wiping dribbles off, but not too rounded that it just smears the food around.-Chunky handles perfect for adults AND baby to hold.-Hasn't scratched or discolored after months of usage.-Excellent price for a pack of 6-FINALLY something that does not have gender specific colors!Easy to use to feed baby.They are easy on their tender little gums and the colors are cute.I got these spoons because my son was starting cereal at 4 months and it was recommended to me get get soft-tip spoons.These spoons were to deep for my son because he doesn't know when starting to eat that you should close your mouth over the spoon.We use the 2 pack Gerber baby foods that come in the plastic square packages.I love the soft tip for my toothless baby.I've washed these a million times over the past 6 months and they're still in great shape.My baby loves the colors too.Only complaint is that it will sometimes tip & flip over if you try to rest it somewhere.They have a nice deep well that can hold various amounts of food.The width and size of the well itself is just right for her tiny mouth.The length is perfect and comfortable for me to feed her, they are fun and a great price as well.Great for first foods containing a lot of liquid.As soon as you leave this spoon in a baby food jar or in a small bowl it tips over and the food is on the table, on your lap, on the baby, on the floor....They are soft, have the perfect size for babies mouth and are easy to clean.These are perfect for starting solids.The size and shape work well and the bright colors are attractive.They are long, so you're not getting yourself all messy when trying to get the food out of the container.And they are colorful and interesting for baby to look at.It fit well if you push it on and then don't touch it, but our son of course wanted to touch Mr. Froggie and ended up pulling it off.It would be nice if the plastic was a little bit more flexible and it could be pushed onto the faucet more tightly.My older son loved this thing, which was great because I needed him upright to keep pressure off of his head since he had plagiocephaly.My second son is now using this.He was really happy in there and it was nice to get my hands free knowing he was having fun.I love that the seat spins around so he can decide what he's in the mood to play with.I can't tell you how many pictures we have of our son in this toy with a big grin on his face!First off, I love how the music plays for 5 minutes, and it is easy for my baby to make enough motion to get the music to kick back on.We've been using this jumper since before my daughter was 3 months old (she was holding her head up steady since she was a month old and was perfectly capable of sitting in the seat - granted she sunk in a bit at first and didnt yet have the motor skills to reach & touch the toys).I purchased this jumperoo used from craiglist and it is wonderful.I only paid $25, but now I know how great it is, I would have paid 3x as much!My 6 1/2 month old twins both love this jumperoo.She has loved it and I love that we're still using it 5 months later.I was recommended to get a walker or doorway jumper by friends, whose babies had loved them.But I loved the idea of a toy that encouraged physical activity.I came across jumperoos while searching on amazon.I found a used rainforest jumperoo for half price with only the motion sensing toy still attached.I love that it keeps her occupied for a bit while I do things that don't allow me to hold her, like cooking on the stove.The music it plays is nice.The first is "Froggy Went A-Courtin'" and the third is "The Itsy-Bitsy Spider", but I don't know the other two.My husband bought this when our baby was just over 3 months old.I thought he'd be too small or too young, but when we got it he was able to sit propped in it quite nicely (15 lbs and 23").We put our Wii fit stand underneath since his legs didn't touch the ground, and he bounced away laughing the whole time.It's not the most portable of all equipment, but we have a dedicated spot for it.It is sturdy, easy to put together and looks cute.It's so nice to be able to have him in a safe spot while I cook dinner or attend to something else for a few minutes.Our daughter loved the rainforest playmat so we decided to buy the jumperoo for her when she was big enough for it.this is known as the sanity keeper in our house.My 7 month old loves it.He even bounces when he's not in it now :-)After much debate on what jumparoo we were going to purchase to replace the old Deluxe jumparoo that wasnt working anymore we choose this one.It is the most stable one on the market beside the baby Einstein one but that isnt motion activated.My son 4 months LOVE this one.It has alot of interacting toys and very enjoyable lights & sounds.Seat moves easil for him.This jumper does sit a bit higher than the old deluxe one, we have to use a pillow under it and we didnt have to with the other one.The motion activation isnt working properly so I contacted Fisher price & there sending a new toy unit.My gripes about this unit are that the screws on the rainbow face the baby (??)I have twin 5 month old girls and they have been using this for a month now.Neither of them stay occupied in it for too long and they prefer their exersaucer to this.I was a bit skeptical about purchasing this item as it was so expensive to me.She loves it and it instantly freed up tons of time for me as I could get things done as she happily bounced away.Baby--six months old--loves this.It's just fantastic.this thing is awesome.and he absolutely loves this thing!only thing is it takes a lot of space...but its soooo worth it!Overall I found the quality to be great and very stable (I was a little worried) and would definatly recommend this jumperoo to other parents.I bought this after a coworker recommended it to me, and I would definitely recommend this to others over a doorway jumper.The pictures on the box show it standing straight up like it is held up by a wire or spring, but in reality it's just attached by a piece of rubber and just flops over.I was so happy when I found this as Amazon for much less than at Babies r us.My husband had it put together is about 30 minutes- and I heard no cussing, so I assume it wasnt that difficult to put together.My 7-month old daughter loves this jumperoo.Wish I'd gotten it sooner.This is definitely a wonderful toy.Our baby loved it!Although, he still did great whenever in the jumperoo.We then discontinued use of the jumperoo for a few days and saw remarkable improvement.He now loves to be calm and play with a toy.My grandson LOVES this activity - even when he's cranky, he keeps jumping.... the games keep him interested, and the bouncing never stops.He's on the second level now and is having more fun than ever.The three posts shake and create lots of noise.Although they are a "safe" place to put child, while older kids are in room or have to run to the bathroom.I like the "exersaucer" style better.I could tell my son was a mover and a shaker from early on.When he was young certain ones really appealed to him and others did not.He would get in and have the time of his life bouncing around and laughing.), but she loves jumping on our laps so much I couldn't resist.It was simple to assemble and my daughter loves it!The music and lights are especially fun.We received this as a shower gift, and it was one of the best items that gets a lot of use now!I am keeping this for all my kiddies that is for sure.My son is a big guy and loves alot of active play.COME THE 3-4 months and he loves it!Once in the morning while I make him some food, and once in the evening a bit before bedtime to ware him out.This has the best blend of everything!Definitely a top baby item.We got this for our 4 month old baby girl.The colors are vibrant and fun and the toys keep her entertained.My husband and read so many other reviews on other jumpers but this one was clearly the best.I bought it when he was only 3 months old, thinking we'd use it a little later on.The next day there was a shoebox underneath him!:)  Needless to say, he wasn't ready for bouncing, but he loved the colors and lights at first.He's been bouncing ever since and absolutely loves it!We got this for son when he was five months old.His toes didn't quite touch the ground so we put a pillow underneath him.The music and sound effects (like the elephant trumpeting) are really cute although I think my husband is a little sick of hearing them!But if you have the space, this is definitely the jumper to purchase.Your baby will love it and you will love watching your baby have so much fun!My 7-month-old daughter LOVES her Jumperoo!Her aunt, who babysits her during the day, bought one for her house.The baby liked it so much, we bought one for our house as well.We had to raise the seat a bit because she was practically bottoming out from bouncing so enthusiastically.My husband and I sit there and crack up just watching her, it is so entertaining!This toy has been a lifesaver for us.It's a safe place to put the baby while I'm cooking, etc.I cant wait to see how much better she likes it when she understands it more!!!But after a few times, he started understanding and now he LOVES it.I love how the music plays when he's jumping.The jumper seems very safe and I don't ever feel like he'll tip over.The base is wide, and has a large footprint, but I'd rather it be large and safe than not.But the seat is very supportive and I appreciate the support behind the head.It was SLIGHTLY too big for her, but we just fold a blanket underneath.I absolutely love this.It has so many cute and engaging activities for babies.This is a very unique idea, and my daughter really loves it.She loves all of the toys and as she walks around she seems surprised to find something new at each station.I love that the seat is detachable and she will be able to use it as when she is standing/walking as well.VERY NICE WAY TO TAKE BABYS TEMP...EVEN THE NURSE AT THE HOSPITAL USED IT ON THE BABY WHEN I SHOWED IT TO HER....BABY LOVES IT LIKE A TOY AND IT READS HIS TEMP WELLThese work well so far.I think it's a great value for the price and it helps protect the seats from kid's messy shoes.Great purchase!In my pregnancy induced happy haze, I disregarded people's complaints about some of the item in the kit.I'd never had a baby before, I figured that someone had figured out what I needed for me and put it in this kit.This is partially true.In the first few months, you will need a digital thermometer, a bulb syringe/aspirator, nail clippers or file, and hair brush or comb.So, out of 17 items, I've used 5 or 6.The other 11-12 have not been touched.Of the items, I've used, I didn't like most of them.The nail clipper have been okay, I still use it, but I bet there are better ones you can buy separately- I've been meaning to get some.But I would like any brush and comb, I'm sure.I've ended up buying a new thermometer (that I love) and a new aspirator (that I also love).If you are an expectant parent and trying to plan for your first baby, just get a good rectal thermometer (I have a Vicks that I like) some good nail clippers or a tiny nail file,  and maybe a little brush for baby's hair.This kit will most likely disappoint.I was very pleased with this kit.LOL  The lock does work when you screw it on but it is very bulky.I did a lot of research before deciding to order this pillow, and I am satisfied with my purchase.Since I started using this pillow my pain has all but vanished!This pillow is amazing!No more tossing and turning.I will even continue to use this pillow after my pregnancy.Many pregnant women that I've spoken with constantly complain about how hot they are so I would think that a company that designs pregnancy pillows would take this into consideration and perhaps create pillow contents and coverings that would keep pregnant women cool or at least not overly warm.I was great after that, but my husband was freezing.Since conventional medical wisdom is pretty much telling women to lay on their left sides for proper blood flow to the child, you really don't have too many options of sleeping in any other position unless you accidentally end up that way in the middle of the night.Size - this pillow is huge.I have a queen sized bed which is pretty average for most couples in America and this pillow takes up more than half of it.The very first night I used it it helped me so much in getting a good nights rest.Now I am 34.5 weeks with twins and get back pain when I try laying down without this pillow.I have had an extremely easy twins pregnancy, and this pillow helped with that.Now I don't always get a good nights rest, but this pillow really has helped me.I have to flip over about 4 times during the night when my lower arm starts to go numb etc.This pillow could likely also be used a nursing pillow, but having twins I wanted a more sturdy twins nursing pillow.My hubbie loves this pillow to, and has stolen from me on occasion!The cover is very comfortable.I don't find that to be really true.My right hip hurts me and the pain is aggrevated when I turn inside this huge pillow.I normally wake up surrounded by pillow softness, and the support (especially for my back and belly) has been amazing!!We have a queen sized bed, and it fits fine.I get very warm at night, so I wash the pillow cover on a regular basis.It's not the softest material, but once I go to bed, I don't notice it at all.Totally worth the price to sleep better from now until my baby is born.She uses it for everything, and we use it even t encurage her to eat, by distracting her enough for her to open her mouth!It is def the one to go to when she is throwing a fit, she settles down right away and just dazes right into it lovenly.So set aside from the heaviness part, this is areally incredible teether/rattler in one.If they made it a little lighter, this would def be a 5 star item!We love anything with monkeys so we definitely had to have this for our son.Its not a chewy teether toy but my son still plays with it and tries to eat it.We bought this rattle for our son a couple of weeks ago.He loves it.It really is a bargain.People obviously have babies with different preferences, so for those who disliked the swing system, my experience with my infant son was vastly better.as advertised -- i like it (however it does not fit the Baby Bjorn portable crib)Love the Miro design)I love the KeyFit 30!It is not exceptionally heavy, I love the bright red color (Fuego), and the latch mechanism for securing the shoulder straps in front of the baby's chest works wonderfully.The detachable base allow for easy installation (you don't have to work around the seat) and it can connect with either a standard seat-belt or the LATCH system, which most newer vehicles have.The bubble level makes it easy to get level correctly, and install instructions are on the side and center of the base as well.The strap adjustment is pretty easy to do, so you can easily loosen the straps, slide the kiddo in, and then pull the adjuster tight to get a snug fit, no matter what outfit your infant is in.Another nice feature is the newborn insert to fit around the really tiny ones in the early days.One thing to make sure of is to read the manual.If you're looking at it for that combo, it works great.Summary:It really is a great car seat, and I'm very happy we went with it.If you're on the edge, try and find a shop you can do a test fit in, and play with it compared to other models you have in mind.Yes it is safe and good quality, but I should have baught the Britax!That way, we keep the base in my car, and my husband can use the seat in his car without the hassle of moving the base.It fits perfectly and feels plenty secure to me - I just suspect that Chicco didn't want to pay the licensing fee to BOB to be a 'compatible carrier' - but of course, you are your own parent and use your best judgment as to this modification's safety.it's got just about everything to make getting baby in and our safe.the inserts for newborns are wonderful and kept my baby from juggling around.Its so easy to install, and its really easy to get my son in and out.I also like that the seat has a head rest that is separate from the infant insert.It is super easy to install, get him in and out and adjust the harnass.I also love the color options.I am recommending this seat to everyone!!!We also bought an additional base so we could use the carseat in either my car or my husband's.My daughter is big for her age and she still fits in this at six months.We use it in combination with the Snap and GoBaby Trend Snap N Go-Single Strollerwhich is an inexpensive and practical solution for transporting baby almost anywhere.We love it!!We bought the Chicco Keyfit 30 car seat because it is the most compact car seat we found that had top rated safety features.After a 5-day drive cross-country and several plane trips, it still looks new.True that's not the safest spot for the car seat but it'd be nice to let parents choose.-- It is heavy-- The base is frequently out of stock so take care to get the spare well before you need itMy only complaint about this car seat is that my son sweats like crazy in it.We live at 7,000ft so not in a warm climate by any means - houses where we live don't even have AC.I could not imagine how much he'd sweat in a warm or humid climate.Going to look at other options for our next baby as our son loves his car seat and going for rides until he is soaking in sweat.We bought this car seat three years ago and have used it with two babies now and it's of such amazing quality that we'll use it with our third baby.It honestly still looks as new.It installs easily, looks great, can be cleaned easily and most of all is sturdy and of good quality.I think most reviews have established this as a wonderful travel system - it really is.For me, that's a trade off I'm willing to make.My only issue with this set was the powerful odor it came with.I purchased this item after reading the Recommendation given by Consumer Reports on it.After using it for a month now, I can tell you that it is very user friendly, very well constructed and looks very safe (I hope I never have to find out if it ACTUALLY is safe, that is why I trust CR).They have many colors available and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.I had to deal with Chicco for a problem I had with a playard I bought, and their Customer Service is very good and helped me out fast.This is the whole package right here: Best Buy by Consumer Reports, good customer service, great experience as an owner for me...that means I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.We got this stroller after much research.My husband is VERY tall, 6'8", and not just any stroller would work.Another difference is that the covered section on the parent tray is slightly smaller on the newer (post 2007) models.Read the manual for how to use this correctly.*The stroller is great and rides very smoothly.The fabric is of nice quality.*The basket is very large and easily accessible.*The parent tray is very nice and handy.*The child seat is large & roomy.*It reclines fully and the footrest encloses the space to create a sort of bassinet.*The wheels are nice and lockable in the front and back.*The canopy isn't super large, but it can be tilted forward, so you can still shield baby's eyes, depending on where the sun is.I recommend RayShade UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams BlackRayShade which you can easily attach to any stroller and move from one to another for far superior sun protection.Chicco now makes a double stroller, which accepts this car seat, so you can use it for a 2nd child as well.In fact, many double strollers accept various car seats, and this is one of the most popular, and has the best safety ratings.Hope this review helped you make your decision.We have been so happy with our Chicco Cortina travel system!Everything about it is practically perfect.My favorite features include:- 4 cup holders & a small item case, plus a basket underneath for more storage- easy to remove car seat cover & pads to wash- I can remove it from my trunk & unfold it all with one hand- canopy rotates down to cover my baby's face when facing the sunlight- adjustable handle bar- the carseat base is SO nice & easy to use- the color schemes & fabric are very stylish, easy to clean, and durable- carseat snaps in SO easily to both the stroller & the base, it's very easy to use- unlike other strollers we've both used & tested, none of the adjusting mechanisms have EVER jammed or given us trouble.We tested out ALL of the strollers we could find, and this one both rides & folds/unfolds better than them ALL.and honestly, as a parent with a million baby products, that is very rare.I really have no major complaints about this system, having had a Graco travel system with my oldest child I definitely prefer this system to the Graco one.After the newborn stage I really don't like lugging around an infant seat at all, no matter what brand/style.I have only two minor complaints.I had read the manual while pregnant but honestly didn't read much having to do with the stroller because I figured it was just a stroller, what could be so hard.The straps adjust pretty easily too.I just love how the base works with the latch system so easily too, hook it up, press a button and the base is in the car nice and tight.After using it for 5+ months I know why the rated it higher.That being said...I bought this in "Miro" to go with the Chicco Keyfit 30 Carseat.I did a lot of research before picking this stroller, and now I wish I had done more.CONS:-Wheels have a mind of their own.The wheels, even when you're trying to push forward, don't always face that way.Also doesn't attach well, as it's constantly falling out of position.It was very easy to put together.There's a basket underneath, but you can't get to it when the stroller is reclined.The sunshade is nice and it has a window where you can see through to the child.I wish it would have been clear rather than tinted.There's a small pouch on the back of the sunshade that's a decent size.It's REALLY a pain when the seat is reclined too.But it works for small amounts of things.I like that it's a 5 point harness, but I wish there were a way to detach the top two points when you weren't using it.They lay under her and get tangled with the waist harness when it's not in use.The snack tray part is ok, but the cup holders aren't very deep.Often her cup will fall over when I'm pushing her and they're not very wide either.When you do try to move it, it still obstructs the path to the seat.The sunshade doesn't pop off as much when I fold the stroller, like it used to.It's worked well for us.I do like the way the seat back attaches to the frame.It's hard to explain, but if you're standing in front, looking at the seat, you can't see through any spaces.That space above the seat back, where there's extra material, has become a second basket for me.This is a great playard.My baby is 2 months old, and I have been changing him on the attached changing table, and laying him in the bassinet to play, since he was born.Both the bassinet and changing table surface are well-padded.Overall, it feels very safe.When I put my baby on the changing table (he is still under 15 lbs), I feel very confident that with the depth of the sides, he is very, very safe lying there.Also, that attached pockets for storing diapers, etc, are very handy.To be upfront, my husband and I haven't actually used this as a playard yet, just as a bassinet and as a changing table.This pack and play is extremely easy to use for both.PROS: The nightlight and music are great.The diaper changing area has enough little pockets for everything.It is very sturdy.I can't believe how this huge thing can fold up so small!You can't use the pack and play as a changing table and a bassinet at the same time - meaning you have to take off the changing table apparatus to use the bassinet.However, while a bit of a con, the changing table fits neatly into the side of the pNp and is also very sturdy and well made.We purchased this playard to match the stroller/car seat we bought for our daughter.The material and finish is excellent.When just using one, the suction was perfect.The noise level is fine for me, but I don't care if people can tell I'm pumping.It's reliable, easy to use, and powerful without doing damage.And the best part is how easy it is to clean.Don't be overwhelmed by all the various parts; it's not as complicated as it looks at first.If you have the extra accessories, you can also convert it to be a manual pump, according to the manual.This set does its job, although it is not as efficient as the baby of course.The suction cups on the flanges sometimes lose their grip, and I have to fiddle with it to get it back in place.I bought it in March 2008.My son was born in June 2008 and I really started using it in August when I went back to work.This gave me a bunch of spare parts and bottles.I had to manually express after each pumping session.I don't feel comfortable going back to work with this one, so I'm having to purchase a 3rd pump, which will come with all of the extra parts & accessories.Luckily, I live in a well populated area where they are easy to come by on Craigslist (Atlanta).I tried various things: replacing the white valves (this tends to help because they wear out), increasing the suction, replacing the tubing, purchasing horns in different sizes, but I kept expressing less and less milk while the process grew more and more uncomfortable.I found that it not only allows me to pump hands-free without having to struggle with an ill-fitting bustier, but it also somehow allows me to comfortably express 50-100% more milk per session than I was able to with the Ameda.I bought this back in 2007, its been really useful for my wife, and now we're using it for kid#2.Has an extra timer so you can track last time you fed the baby medicine or whatever.I like that you can press a button for backlight, but sometimes I have to press the button several times before it works (that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5), but it's only $20, so it's well worth the money!ETA: It's now March 2014 and I used this again with baby #2 after storing it for 3 years.It never worked correctly for my daughter & son in law.I love that you have the option of an alarm or just a flashing light.I also love that it has a locking feature because it keeps my older son from resetting it.The size is great for traveling with too!In the middle of the night when you haven't slept in weeks, no more do you have to ponder whether you fed the baby, thought about feeding the baby or just dreamed about feeding the baby.Also, you hit the button so you don't have to worry about what time it was, FINALLY!There is also a lock on it so you can't accidentally hit a button and throw your whole game off.The best part about the Itzbeen for me is:1.Because of the ItzBeen, I knew what was probably bothering him since I could assess what had or hadn't been addressed with some serious accuracy.3.Simple, straightforward, and amazing.I put this on my registry and received it as a gift.It was one of our most used items in the first 8 weeks.Maybe because baby is in a growth spurt and I am just feeding constantly lately.Feed Indicator: I really really wanted this after the birth of my son so I could remember when the last time I fed him was.When I remembered to have it next to me it was great to be able to push the bottle button when I would start to nurse him and then I would have something to reference later.Easy.Change the baby.3.Now, that my son is 4 months old, I may have a use for this function, but by now none of the other buttons are of any use to me.4.With all this said, I don't blame you if you think it is cool and want it anyway.It would be great if it had a counter for each wet and soiled diapers instead of the timer.An added bonus was the tiny LED flashlight that allowed me to check in on her in the middle of the night without disturbing her or my husband with lamps.By week three I found myself using it less and less and by week five it's sitting on the dresser collecting dust, but I am glad I had my Itzbeen for those first critical weeks and I recommend it to any new parents.It made any outting so much smoother and enjoyable because you aren't constantly looking for a clock to know how much time you have to get something done.I love the itzbeen!It works well for us.Somedays we have two or three family members watching the baby and this makes for a smooth transition and helps us keep him on schedule.The nurses don't always come with them unless you ask, and if you look at your timer, you can tell if you are ready to receive them.My baby and I had a bad blood interaction and his bilirubin went thru the roof, and the timer helped me realize he was really being sleepy even when I would use all the tricks to wake him up.I keep the timer in my pocket of my "brestfriend" nursing pillow or hooked onto my waist.I LOVE THIS THING.My first one was defective, and I emailed the company and they sent me a crand new one that works BETTER with no questions asked.They were FABULOUS.I hated the days I lived wihtout it.highly recommended!I used this for the first 2 months to help me remember when I fed my daughter last.I love it.It's a great item, and I don't know how I would have survived without it.The best additional feature is of course the clock.It kept me sane when I was exhausted.I've dropped it a ton of times on hardwood flooring and it's had no issues!This is the item I will include in all my gifts to friends at their baby showers for sure!I highly recommend it!While I don't use ALL the functions, the ones I use are indispensable.If we are out on the town, the timer reminds me to get someplace for a feeding.The sleep button is just for fun at my house.This button helped me stay on track.The timer helps not have to remember when we changed the diaper or fed the baby last time in the daze that surrounds the parents of a newborn.Love this thing - highly recommend.My only wish is for a larger display as it's hard to see the time from a distance.It certainly helped me maintain my sanity for the first 6 months of my son's life.I just got this a few weeks ago and while my son hasn't started fully using it, I love the quality.Pretty sure a monkey could defeat them.He'll stand there and play with it for ages.Also, it is a bit on the large size so it works only with the really big juice boxes.I bought this for my 23 month old.They aren't too lose or too tight!It's a perfect fit.I wish you could choose a color.They were easy to apply and so far have stood up to my son chewing on them with no issues.We have a mix of surfaces in our living room.So, off to the store to get babyproofing as our 6 month old started pulling herself up precariously using the table, couch, etc.We have a raised slate hearth that runs the length of our living room (the edge is about 22 inches off the ground).My son likes to chew on the edge (yuck) and uses it to cruise but because the edge is so sharp and so hard I wanted something to protect him should he slip.It went on easily and and completely blends in.The adhesive tape also came off pretty easily and we were able to get any residual stickiness off with a little goo gone and an old toothbrush.easy to install and can cut to any size.Well worth it, even if they do need to be remounted with better adhesive.This is the only brand edge guard that comes in black which is necessary for dark wood furniture.I ran out of tape before I ran out of material.They should supply the same amount of tape as they do bumper, because if you don't tape every inch, that is the piece that will come off, and that is where baby will get hurt (I know from experience).But, alas, it is still the only brand that comes in black, so I borrow the tape I need from the other Lionheart box.The concept is nice, but as other reviewers pointed out, it closes AS it hits something, not before.If he were to hit something with it in his mouth, he could probably get really hurt, so we just don't use this because of that.Purchased this to try, since I thought it was an interesting concept, but found that it made me nervous, because it would pinch shut while on my son's mouth.We have an 80# black lab/great pyrenees and an agile 10# calico cat that we were wanting to keep from entering our 5 month old's and our bedroom in order to have some fur-free areas of the house.I must say that this gate has done a great job of keeping what needs to be kept in, in and what needs to be kept out, out.:) Since then, she's not expressed any interested in jumping it.We have had an issue with a spring coming apart from the latch but that was because our cleaning lady didn't know how to operate the latch and inadvertently forced it open.I haven't installed it yet but they told me it was easy to replace.So.. My wife and i had tried out the Summer Extra Tall gate and were underwhelmed by the limitations and i was disappointed by the narrowness of the walkthru part of the gate.With that said, we opted to try the Kidco Extra Tall (extra tall so cats cant jump over)..Numerous great reviews prompted us to give it a try.Value: Well, $90 + $25 for an extension makes this by FAR the most expensive baby gate option for us.Installation: It lacked REAL detailed pictures for step by step walkthru.. (i figured it out on my own, but there is no way my wife would have understood this)Use: After it was installed, we began testing and QUICKLY learned after about 15 minutes this was not the gate for us.The part you walk thru was the nicest feature about it.It was 22'' wide.It doesnt flow smoothly to pull up and over.At the bottom, there is a 'bracket' that extends down about 1 inch.This bracket ensures the door is aligned to the frame.Just a thought for those who care for similar mental stimulation but not attached to the idea of a puzzle.I bought this seat for my 2 year old son who is just beginning to potty train.Because of the high pee guard on the front, he has to be lifted up onto the seat.If you want your child to be able to use the seat by himself, this one probably won't work.Now that my son has more confidence on the potty we are using the Baby Bjorn again...it's a much better seat and well worth the extra money!FYI:  This seat WILL NOT work on a ROUND toilet bowl.It has to be an ELONGATED bowl.I didn't like this seat and we don't use it anymore.At first they seemed okay but then they started to leak.At first I thought the actual bottle was leaking but now I believe it is the seal between the screw on part, vent, and bottle and I do make sure everything is tight.I got one of these bottles as a gift and decided to use it when my Avent bottles were all in the dishwasher.These bottles are great and I just bought some more.I don't mind the extra parts at all.My baby was breast fed and she transitioned easily to them.LOVE EM!We went through EVERY bottle system before settling on this one.I didn't completely understand the different stages of the nipples.The stage 3 works perfectly for getting the formula/rice mix out at the same rate as the Stage 2 did for formula.Ah yes, it is only a light bottle filled with a few oz.The theory being that we could use our current bottle system and go from these to the green nipple to make full sippy cups.Yes, I bought the training cups and not the drinking cups.I have correctly fitted all parts together and these cups still leak!I must be looking for an elusive cup that doesn't seem to exist.I hated them.We bought this for our 4 month old in hopes that she would drink breast milk from this cup since she is now refusing an occasional bottle.I tried simply not using the vent, but then the bottles seemed to leak.SO, because I've used Born Free for some time now, I thought I'd give the born free sippy cup trainer a try.I double checked to make sure everything was screwed on tightly, tried again, and the thing still leaks.I was going to give this bottle 2 stars, to be nice & because I've used the bottles for so long, but... ARGH!Ok so sippy cups are not rocket science, but this cup has a few too many parts to put together.It's a lot to separate, clean and keep from getting lost in the cabinet.It also leaks a bit more than the others.Mine certainly can't.This cup uses an entirely different method.First off, the spout is soft, which is great because my son chews on everything.We used the stage 1 nipples for the first three months.We then moved up to the stage 2 and solved all the problems.Nicely constructed, easy to use.But doesn't work in my tub because we have a shower curtain and it won't close with this in the way.It also handily blocks access to the faucet and all the enticing knobs on that end of the tub.Our bathtub would surely be a much messier place without it.I like this bath caddy much better than the normal kid ones( like the turtle that suctions to the wall).I also dont have to worry about suction cups letting go of the wall because we have textured walls in our shower.Cute and practical!I love that it's anti-microbial and reusable, my snack-sized Ziploc bag pacifier storage days are over, and I have even more peace of mind about cleanliness.So there is never a problem with detachment or locating the pocket, from personal experience.This thing is really easy to set up and take apart if you read the instructions first.I finally got fed up, fetched the manual and we were done shortly after.It was actually pretty funny and not a big deal since we knew how easy it was to set up.The changing table is awesome, although I wish there was more storage room around that little diaper stacker.But I love that it detaches for easy transition to the crib or for a roadtrip or something.This pack n play is great.It fits our decor perfectly.It was easy to assemble and it is very sturdy.The changing table folds out of the way which is nice.And the height of the changing table is perfect for me and my husband.It is held on with tape so we ended up using super glue.Well the stool didn't do all the work for the potty training, but it did make it easy for my daughter to get herself up and down safely to the adult potty in our house.This sturdy wider, taller base and easy to remove side arms give her the stability to go alone.Needless to say, I quickly purchased a different brush and discarded this one.I recommend the Munchkin brand bottle brush.The brush is great.I don't see, though, why it would be better than any other brush out there.brush actually works great, but i see chunks of sponge coming off almost daily after use.I used to use this as our primary bottle brush but now use it as a back-up, for traveling, etc.It does the job okay, but the sponge has started to break apart.I much prefer our First Years brush, complete with the tiny little nipple scrubber that folds out.It's held up a lot better too.The First Years Bottle Nipple BrushI love this bottle brush and am surprised at the low ratings that others are giving it.I have had this brush for 3 months now and I have no rust issues, the metal wire part has not bent and I use this brush at least 2-3 times per day everyday.Good for many brands, not just Dr. Browns.These are the best brushes to use for the Dr. Brown bottles.I bought several of these throughout the washing of bottles for 15 months.Also, the nipple part isn't the best.I kept the nipple cleaner part of one brush for that purpose.Also, the suction didn't work very good.Overall, I bought this style brush because it cleaned my bottles the best and I was willing to overlook the other very small flaws.We like the Fisher Price Link-a-Doos better but these links are fun and good for deep teething too.Perfect for attached toys to kicknplays... carseats... etc.My son loves these!My daughter loves these.My son is 11 months old and still loves them!My 7 month old loves these, especially banging them against his crib rails.He's been using them since he was about 4 months old and I they are nice and easy to grip.Great to chew on too!i purchased this for my daughter and being that she's nine months, she is a bit too young for them.All the kids in daycare loved it as well.The moby wrap is great!The Pacific color is gorgeous!The Moby wrap is great!I love being able to keep him tucked in close to me....but it just didn't happen.I tried so many different ways but the baby never felt secure in it.The material is a really thick, high-quality jersey, but I found myself overheating every time I wore it, even when it was winter- and don't even get me started on how hot this thing was in the summer.Pros:-Really soft, available in tons of nice colors and some patterns.-Machine washable, and it washes nicely.-ummmm... that's it, really.Cons:-Hard to use.-Doesn't feel secure.-Really hot.I ended up selling mine for about half what I paid for it, and the girl who bought it ended up loving it for her very small baby, so I really do think that for this carrier is great for some people, just not for me.I ended up with a few different woven (non-stretchy) wraps and I like those much better.Tying the Moby is an art not a science.Like all arts, it has to be perfected.We still flub it up on occasion but we expect that.So we bought a Moby Wrap (in slate--a beautiful color) to use until she can comfortably use the Ergo.Unfortunately, we didn't have the Moby Wrap for our son (our first child).I used this everyday when I was off work after I had my little one.Very comfortable.There is a lot of research indicating baby wearing is beneifical for both baby and parent.It is a great way for her to explore your world with out breaking your back and arm.P.S.My little one would get very hot against my skin and would sweat...then we would both get hot.While putting on the Moby can be a daunting task, I loved using it once I got it right.My newborn was nice, warm and secure.This was one of my favorite baby carriers when my son was a newborn.I bought it when he was around 3 weeks old and REFUSING to be put down for even a second.I had entered into motherhood with the expectation that I could use one baby carrier for all applications.Actual physical help is invaluable.My favorite things about the Moby:-Very comfortable to wear- no straps digging in my back or shoulders.I also wash it with everything else- if it shrank I never noticed.).-Once my son was about 5 or so months old, I think the Moby stopped being so great and the Ergo started to seem better.I applaud those moms who love their Moby for older kids, especially for back carry etc... it just seemed like too much work for me.-I don't know that I would have paid full price for a Moby, honestly.I was hesitant to try it out even though it was highly reccomeded by my midwife because it just seemed too complicated.After a little looking, I found mine on Craigslist for around $20, which seemed worth the risk.Of course, I would happily pay full price now, knowing how useful it was.My son is happy in it, but in the summer it's a bitch!I don't know about other women, but having sweat streaming down my face and back and front is not my idea of fun or comfortable!It was awesome when he was a newborn in the winter months, but at 5 months in anything above 85 I'd prefer something more breathable.~It's easy to set up.I have a front pack, but it makes my back ache.My back is pain free.~More freedom for baby.i just LOVE my Moby.My son also HATED being swaddled after his first year of life so I was concerned he would feel too restricted in the Moby.Now that he is almost five months, I can put him facing outward or inward, depending on our moods.He loves it and so do I!I only wish I had two so one could be in the wash...I bought this on the passionate recommendations I received from friends who are new moms and my doula.my baby fights me when i try to put her in and it's too tight.my point is, it's tricky to get it consistent, so it takes time for me to get it right often having to take the baby out to adjust.my baby consistently overheats when she is in the moby.we have used it mostly in a cool indoor setting, and she still overheats.I recently bought this item thinking it would be ideal for my 2 month old daughter.My daughter was okay with being in it but certainly didn't love it.I wish I'd never bought one.It is a little warm for Arizona but I have a feeling that no matter what you use in AZ, it will always be warm.It is easy to use.If I could give this item over 5 stars, I would!!It's fabulous!I hear no complaints from him once he is tucked in there, he's usually asleep within 20 minutes and it has saved my back!I have Bjorn Air and Bjorn Active carriers and this wrap is definitely more comfortable for me.My husband won't use the Moby though.It takes some practice tying the wrap so don't give up after the first try.4 stars for comfort and versatility.It's very easy to put on (read the directions once and had it down).My baby LOVES it.Great for walks and getting stuff done around the house.Highly recommended!!i absolutely love my moby wrap!i'm even registering for another one, not for necessity, but purely because it'd be more fun to have another color!I own aBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Black, an Ergo Baby Sport Baby Carrier (withERGO Baby Carrier Infant Insert - Camel), and aHotslings Everyday Collection Baby Carrier Tokyo size 3, and the Mobywrap is by far my favorite baby carrier.It is the only carrier I own comfortable enough to be practical.It is truly comfortable to wear my baby (now ~14 lbs) in this carrier.Biggest Con:It's really, really not easy or obvious to put on when you first do it.Better yet, find a baby-carrier group in your area and go to their meetings to get help with it.Not as good as having a friend to show you, but better than trying to follow written instructions.Unfortunately, my baby doesn't love the mobywrap.Some babies just love to be carried, and if yours is one, then I highly recommend a wrap like this one.It will make you freer and more comfortable than you were before.I've never tried to nurse in my moby.I started using this wrap when my son and I came home from the hospital.Here's what I have to say after four months of use:Pros:-Great instruction book-Wonderful selection of colors and prints-Excellent Customer Service-Well-made-Easy to wash-Durable(hasn't stained,frayed, or faded)-versatile-comfy for mama and baby-cost-effectiveCons:-Hard to wrap in dirty situations without help to keep the ends from dragging the ground-Takes a little practice to get it wrapped just right-Stretches out during walking/hiking, requiring a re-wrap every 1-1.5 hours-Hard to make sure baby and mama are at a comfortable temperature.I love the moby.It is quite easy to put on, just read the instructions, practice once and you'll have it down.And- super easy to wash.What I don't like:It is a bit toasty on warm days.Overall:Buy it, you'll like it.This is why we use it for our twins.I have a very tall frame, as does my husband, so we found this one to have a little extra length to double-knot at the end of wrapping.The Moby D Wrap comes in some gorgeous colors and styles.We have the red and black silk one - seriously, SO beautiful that I used it in a formal setting.The cotton ends still are made of the comfortable jersey-like material, but the large middle panel is more tightly woven (like the silk) and so it doesn't tend to "loosen" as easily as the Moby D can (though if you take the time to tie it correctly, you shouldn't have any problems).I can get mine out and on my body with the twins snuggled inside within 2 minutes.It is worth is for how comfortable this wrap is.They love it, always fall asleep in it, and I'm able to keep curious strangers' hands away from their faces!All five of my children have LOVED this wrap as much as I do.This is  life saver!I am able to get it on and off very easily now.Baby loves it, I love the flexibility of it.I can nurse easily and discreetly in it too.I love the *idea* of the Mobi, but the complex and error-fraught process of putting it on makes it a logistical fail for me.This wrap is very comfortable and versatile.I have washed the wrap already and it washes nice.I just had my 4th child and have used numerous baby slings/carriers and this is by far the best I have ever found.It seems overwhelming because it is such a long piece of fabric, but with a little practice you can put it on in just a few minutes and it feels like a T-Shirt.It's useful in the house, but not practical for anything else.Very easy to wrap, most holds are used with one wrap method and this is a huge plus in my book.My little girl is 8 months now and we still love our Moby.I may not have been able to use it much recently since it is winter, but I carry her when I'm outside with my other kids.I've received many compliments on it!Very easy to wash when it needs it!Baby carriers aren't for everyone, but if you want something simple and comfortable, this really is it!She moves a lot in general and she also likes to look out into the world not at my chest so with that in mind this isn't ideal for her.Not like the picture at all where she actually looks stylish.I think I will try the Sleepy Baby Wrap which is stretchier.My baby really liked his Bumbo starting at 3 mos, but now that he's closer to 5 he is starting to get bored in it.***Edit***So I snapped the two parts of the tray together.You have to tip the seat to get the bottom flange underneath, which doesn't seem very safe, nor is it easy (my baby is 17lbs).It fits snugly on the bumbo seat.I don't like how you have to take it off and on to get your baby out, taking the tray on and off with an infant still in the seat is not the easiest.Easy to pop on and off -- makes the Bumbo even more wonderful!(Now 3 months old)Now knowing what the others have stated: that they have said their children can rip the tray off the base, I can see how that would be possible.She really enjoys it, since she has started reaching for things and pulling them to her mouth.This tray is awesome.The waterproof lining separates from the nylon and began to rip apart after a few months of use.I love these and they are very heavy duty.Other than that, these are great.I have the Petunia and it works perfectly.I love it.Very comfortable.These are absolutely adorable, but they don't stay in place between baby's wiggling legs.I was nervous getting this one since it's so much bigger than the XL but it fits perfectly!I don't know what I would have done if I hadn't found this shield!Shipping was super fast.Some suggest that the bigger the better, so I got this size.I am a D cup with nursing and a C before.It works better, but I'll have to get a smaller size.The Bugaboo cup holder was a great, and much needed addition to our Chameleon stroller.Assembly was easy and all parts are included for each type of stroller in the Bugaboo line.i bought 2 of these for the Bee (one for child and one for parent).it's nice for him to have his cup at-the-ready while strolling around.although somewhat pricey for its simple function, it would have been nice if the attachment clamp were universal as opposed to having 3 of them in the box for the correct size.I really like the shade and got a lot of compliments on it.I returned it for the full size version because the sun was still getting to my little one.-Easy to install-Easy to put away-I could still keep it on when I folded my stoller although I would not recommend storing it that way.-Because of the angle of the sun in the evening, we needed a little more protection for my baby's fair skin and light eyes.-Pay attention to the trim color on your stoller.When I purchased the full size version I opted for black.This works great for a Mclaren Triumph.Amazon had the best price, fast and easy shipping, and I couldn't be happier.This works perfect!It was well worth the m oney!It fits perfectly on our Chicco Cortina.If they made an even bigger one, or a UV protective bubble (just kidding), I'd buy the biggie.What drew me to this changing table was the style.I like the open part above the 3 drawers and the side cupboard.It seems sturdy enough to change a baby and store things, but don't try standing on it or anything out of the norm and I wouldn't try to move it around a lot.Love having baby face me.Love the colors and look.I got black one with blue color inside though I wish I got a pink one.Great item for the paranoid mom who does not want baby to touch any dirty space.After I bought this item, I saw it at walmart for a dollar cheaper.Inside I have just what I need for baby, diapers and wipes.I don't always bring the changing pad so it is nice that it is removable.Only things I wish were different: The changing pad really has no cushion.The wipes container doesn't hold a ton of wipes, if you have a BIG diaper change you really don't have much extra after you clean up (although, I do tend to use a lot of wipes so this may not apply to everyone).I originally purchased this for a cross country trip to use on the airplane, it worked great!!I didn't want to have to carry my whole diaper bag to the tiny airplane bathroom.I was looking for a replacement changing pad and came across the First Years Deluxe Fold & Go Diapering Kit and the Munchkin Travel Diaper Kit.They cost about the same as a changing pad, but boasted the additional feature of being a diaper kit (meaning they contain the pad, diapers, and wipes).Both had similar features, though the Munchkin Kit cost twice as much as the Deluxe Fold & Go Kit.Both of them would be cumbersome to carry by hand or have dangling from your stroller.Changing pad: Winner - Deluxe Fold & GoThe measured size of the changing pads for both kits is the same.The Munchkin Kit's pad is removable (it is attached by velcro), which is a really nice feature.It allows you to use the pad w/o having the diapers/wipes right by the baby's head for easier access.Also, the more oval shape of the Fold & Go Kit's pad covers more area than the rectangular wings of the Munchkin Kit.Mesh pockets: Winner - Munchkin Travel Kit (by alot)Mesh pockets are really important because that is what makes these items "diapering kits" vs. just a changing pad.Both kits feature two mesh pockets, one to hold the included wipes case, and the other to hold diapers.Because it is actually larger, the Munchkin Kit's mesh pockets are also larger.The wipes cases fit fine in both kits in their dedicated mesh pocket, but 4 newborn diapers are squished in 2nd pocket of the Fold & Go Kit, while the 2nd pocket of the Munchkin Kit not only holds the 4 newborn diapers, it is gusseted to put more bulkier/larger diapers inside.The Munchkin Kit's mesh pockets are attached to the same rip stop material as the rest of the kit, while the Fold & Go Kit's mesh pockets are mesh on both sides.The wipes mesh pocket opens along the inside of the Munchkin Kit, and there is Velcro securing the contents of the other mesh pocket.The Fold & Go Kit's mesh pockets both open sideways.Lastly, the openings of the Munchkin Kit's mesh pockets are elastic on one side, which makes reaching into them very easy.The Deluxe Fold & Go Kit looks like a pencil case gone bad, while the Munchkin Kit looks like a nice day planner.Exterior zippered pocket: Winner - Munchkin Travel KitThe zippered pocket on the Munchkin Kit is considerably larger and its contents are easier to access.The Munchkin Kit features a carrying strap along its top, which is a very nice feature because it makes the kit easier to pick up and carry.The  Deluxe Fold & Go Kit doesn't have a carrying strap at all.Overall fit and finish: Winner - Munchkin Travel KitThe Munchkin Kit is an overall nicer kit - nicer to hold, construction seems more sturdy with rip stop fabric and double stitching throughout.The trim on the Munchkin Kit seems solid, like what a good backpack is constructed with, while the Fold & Go Kit features more vinyl, probably better vinyl than the body, but not nearly the quality that the Munchkin Kit features.Price: Winner - Deluxe Fold & GoUnless you beat this product up or use it as your primary diapering travel system, I don't see how the Munchkin Kit is worth twice as much as the Deluxe Fold & Go Kit.The mesh pockets are better on the Munchkin Kit, but twice as good?Sure, you can carry these items in other ways, but then it shows that these kits really can't replace a typical diaper bag.They tell me the food is nice and hot/warm when it is time for her to eat.I was always asking for hot water at restaurants to warm my daughters bottles.I ordered this and it was wonderful.The Medela bottle fit perfectly inside and I could warm her milk anywhere at any time.But why else would you use a jar to keep your food hot?I heated spaghetti to 160 degrees.I preheated the jar with boiling water as some reviewers recommended and then placed the spaghetti in the jar, sealing it tightly.My daugthter loves this sippy.Seems to work very well.I can't get it together anymore.Oh, and it's hard to screw it together so it won't leak.but on the positive side, it's awesome that it's bpa free & it has a super wide mouth (there's no narrowing of the mouth at the top) so it cleans up spotlessly in the dishwasher.We have used this sippy cup for over a year now and had been moderately pleased with it until some recent discoveries...- The cup was never what I would call "leak proof", but I felt the leak was not too bad.If you don't screw the lid on VERY tightly, it will leak a lot.We had one that started leaking profusely (just during regular use, not holding it upside down), even though it was assembled just right.You would not believe the amount of black GOOP that we wiped and scraped out of there after discovering this.I got this when my first son was born (4yrs ago) as a gift and took it everywhere I went ... held onto it for my 2nd child and continue to use it daily.They are great quality.They fit our Serta Nightstar Extra Firm Crib Mattress perfectly!!A perfect compliment to the minky dot cradle bedding in Ecru.Shipped promptly and surpassed expectations.I love these!They've been washed a few times are so far are holding up perfectly.It fits our bassinet perfectly, and is super cozy, soft, and warm.Holds up perfectly in the wash, didn't shrink or pill at all!I bought two of these to go with my bassinet.I'm extremely happy with them.We've been using them for 4 months now and expect to use them for a few more months, hopefully.They wash and dry extremely well and are just as soft as they ever were.I found their crib sheets to be overpriced, so I went with the same type of sheet, but by Carter's instead, and I'm equally happy with that.It fits our Graco pack and play perfectly.We put a little matress pad underneath it to make the bed a little more comfortable.This definitely makes it more comfortable.I have 2 of these and bought 1 for my sister to use for my nephew.I didn't give this 5 stars for two reasons: (1) I got two covers in the celery color to try to somewhat match my bright sage nursery, but the pad is really pale and looks to me to be a lot lighter color than the picture online; and (2) although it says it fits a 35L x 17 pad, I found it only fit okay on my 34.5 x 17.5 pad.Fortunately, I just ordered a replacement pad that's 34 x 17, and I think that extra inch on the length will make it a better fit.But overall, I am very pleased with the quality and the price.Which is why I bought it.I have the Baby Bjorn Travel sheet as well but this works perfectly fine and its much cheaper.Happy with this purchase!It's soft, well made, and our son seems to like it.We're pleased, and would recommend it to anyone who wants a nice sheet for a reasonable price.We travel with our baby frequently and I was looking for a couple of soft sheets to go over the mattress pad and mattress to make the PnP more comfortable for baby.These sheets are perfect!It IS a very snug fit.It fits very snugly over the mattress and is very smooth.We bought two of these in white and they're super soft and our baby loves them and is just as comfortable in her PnP when traveling as she is at home in her crib.I also highly recommend the American Baby Company porta-crib mattress pad to go with this item!I think these are great little liners, and for the price, are fantastic.It is big enough to hold absolutely everything I need it to hold and then some without being the size of a suitcase like most other diaper bags.The adjustable strap does not adjust to be long enough to carry messenger-style and I would like it to be a little more gender neutral.The navy, blue, and red looks very boyish and I have a little girl.I will post some pictures so you can see for yourself.Unlike a lot of other reviews, our spots almost completely disappear when exposed to any type of warmth, even little hands.(I thought that was so cool!My son loves dogs and he loves baths, so I thought they'd be great.My son seems to really like them but he never plays with them in the tub.Nowhere in the description of these 'cloth' diapers does it mention that they are 100% synthetic.Am selling the ones I bought.I wash them on average twice a week and with each passing month they are circulating more slowly (as my baby's bowels function more regularly and effeceintly).They are holding up very well so far.I have asked visitors and no one even knew I was cloth diapering due to a dirty diaper smell.Until the baby begins on solids, soiled diapers can go right from the wetbag to the wash- just add a presoak and extra rinse as you follow the washing instructions.Here we summarize the general categories of modern cloth diapers and give you the pros and cons of using each type:The "Wrap with Prefolds" diaper:Bummis Whisper WrapThe closest thing to traditional cloth diapering of all the modern diapers.The Wrap (also called a "Cover") is waterproof, typically PUL (Polyester Urethane Laminate) fabric with elastic edges.Cotton and hemp are popular.Several manufacturers make fitted diapers in cotton, bamboo, and other natural fiber blends.The absorbent fitted diaper may have Velcro or snaps to close, and the wrap goes over it to form a moisture barrier.Pros: Better absorbency and comfort than "Wrap with Prefolds".Cons: Sort of like putting 2 diapers on, need to buy more sizes, longer drying times than flats.Examples: Fitteds: Kissaluvs, Swaddlebees, Baby Beehinds, ThirstiesWraps: see aboveThe "Pocket" Diaper:Bum Genius Pocket DiaperPocket diapers are made with an outer PUL waterproof layer, inside wicking layer, and "stuffed" with washable absorbent pads (called soakers, doublers, boosters) from an opening in (usually the back edge of) the diaper.There is typically a soft interior material, which gives the baby healthier skin and a dryer feel.Adjustability - fits a wide variety of infants.Some fleece insides may stain.Outer layer is waterproof and typically PUL polyester or nylon fabric and the inside usually includes a multi-layer microfiber (also called microterry) or cotton soaker for absorbency.A soaker may be a completely separate piece that is either laid or snapped into the diaper, or it can be partially or fully attached.Soakers usually have multiple layers stitched together to form a long pad shape (can be rectangular or contoured).It "doubles" the absorbency of the original soaker, hence the name.Booster: Like a doubler (above), but lighter-duty.Boosters "boost" the absorbency of a soaker, hence the name.Liner: This is a super-thin (paper-like) layer that some moms like to put on top, inside their cloth diapers.Snappis are not needed for Pocket or All-in-One/Two diaper styles.One-size vs. Sized/Fitted: Some diapers have adjustability built-in, others come in sizes.Usually you sacrifice some comfort at the high and low end of the size range for "One-size" diapers.Wet Bags come in a variety of sizes and large ones are nice to have near your changing area to hold the day's diaper laundry.Fabrics:PUL: Polyester Urethane Laminate (PUL) is used as a waterproof outer (or layer) fabric for many Wraps, Pocket, and All-in-One/Two diapers.Note: we have heard both P.U.L.and "pull" as pronociations.Microfiber/Microterry: Microterry fiber is a low-lint, soft fiber that is ideal for use as a cloth diaper soaker, doubler or booster.It is the most common fabric used for Pocket diaper soakers.Good quality microfiber has a velvety feel and typically contains 80% polyester and 20% polyamide fibers.Microfiber is 3-4 times as absorbent as cotton for the same bulk and will dry faster.Suedecloth: Used as a lining in many pocket and All-in-One/Two diapers, suedecloth is typically 100% polyester woven material that has a soft feel.It resists staining and wicks away moisture to the inside of the diaper.The fabric will not hold moisture making cleanup a breeze and keeping baby's skin drier than cotton.Microfleece / Microchamois: Thin, soft fleece is used as a lining in some pocket diapers.Microfleece and microchamois (pronounced micro-shammy) have a soft feel against the skin and pull moisture in to the soaking layers.Organic cotton is grown without chemical pesticides, which costs more, but is kinder to the environment.Hemp on its own is not soft enough for baby's skin, so most hemp fabrics are 55% hemp with 45% cotton.Hemp also carries natural antibacterial properties.It is a naturally antibacterial fiber that will not lose its softness after countless washes.Along with hemp, bamboo is kind to the environment due to it being easily renewable and bug-resistant.However, if you are really dedicated to using natural fibers, this is the only one with built-in moisture resisting qualities.What do you do with the poop?Modern diapers do NOT get soaked in an icky pail of wet stuff!Thank goodness!!Most cloth diapers will have the instruction: "shake off solids" and then wash in hot water with 1/3 the normal amount of liquid detergent.You can wash every 1-3 days, depending on preference, and how many diapers you have.Want to try it out?Lots of cloth diapering moms (myself included) started out just wanting to cut down on trash & expenses and were willing to "test drive" cloth for part-time use.Simply take a quick photo, post your items for sale on Diaper Swappers or eBay, and make your graceful exit from cloth.Note: If you have a cloth diaper retailer near you, DO go to a specialty shop.They're my favorite pocket diaper.I love them.I love these!!I bought the Organic AIO one sizes and use those during the day and these during the night.I have a 2 mo old girl and have been using these for a month now.I must say that I was letting the skeptics get me nervous about cloth diapers, but I have to say that I am more than pleased with my experience.When you take into account the cost, reliability and ease of use, these diapers produce.I have the BumGenius 3.0 AIO (one size) and Bumgenius Organic AIO (one size) and both work great.I am still happy with my decision to use these and will continue to recommend them.Excellent diapers.So easy to use.They wash great and come out like new.We bought 24 for our daughter, who has been our only baby to have cloth diapers.:-(What I love:Super absorbent: We tried these on our 2.5 year old just before he potty trained.He used to destroy Pampers, Huggies, and Luvs overnight, so that was very impressive for us.I think he had some light wicking maybe once, but just enough for a seam in his pajamas to be damp.Easy to Clean: The layer of fabric that sits against the baby's skin is very easy to clean.We've been using these for a year and all the insides of our diapers are almost perfectly white.We've never bleached the diapers themselves, so I am impressed with the ability of the liner to stay white!Daddy / Daycare Friendly: Because of the pocket design, I could take these out of the dryer and prepare them all again.Our boys were potty trained at 30 months, and 40 months, so 2 years would be amazing for our daughter.I dried them slightly warmer to encourage the hooks to curl back up as BumGenius recommended, but it didn't change anything.The edges of the seams where the velcro tabs and the velcro strip are sewn onto the diaper are getting raggedy or as with one diaper, unravelling completely.They are soft, well made, and have a great color selection.I have a little boy, and this is wonderful for putting extra absorbancy where needed.They are easy to use, easy to clean and they still look great 11 months on.I don't know how to fold a cloth diaper and since these are already in the diaper format, it's just like using a regular diaper.We use them with flushable diaper liners which makes it really easy to flush solids.I've been pleasantly surprised with just how well these diapers have held up wash after wash.  At first I used to spend time at night assembling the diapers (i.e.We use regular perfume and dye free detergent to wash them.When they begin to smell a little, I just put a capful of bleach in the first wash and they come out smelling and looking new (and the colors are still vibrant on the outer cloth - but don't do this too often as it can wear out the diapers).I highly recommend them.Our baby is 8 months old, and our BG 3.0's are still going strong.The velcro is starting to lose its stickiness around the edges, but we haven't had any problems with the tabs coming off.Great for nights as it comes with 2 sized soaker inserts too.Keeps both girls dry.Can't complain here.I bought this coz its flexible and can be folded to be stuffed into my diaper bag.i could not possibly bring my babybjorn bib.Its great to use in restaurants and has good coverage.I did so much research before my purchase and I am very happy with this gate.A good looking, sturdy gate!I feel confident that my new walker is safe.I used this toy along with Kids Preferred "Amazing Baby Developmental Light-Up Musical", and placed them on a wall above the changing pad, so every time I want to change my baby diaper I pull down one of them then in one second my baby will stop crying and became mesmerized to the light and sound of the toy, It Lights up and flashes as the music plays for 30-40 second.I love this!I have it hanging near my son's changing table and he has loved it since he was a newborn!I play it everytime I change his diaper and he looks at the little red lights and coos and smiles.It was so easy to sit down and just shop through Amazon for the "perfect" items I have been looking for, and have difficulty finding in the stores for prices that are reasonable and affordable.I ordered three of these just in different colors and they do the job and have lasted a few washes already without any color fading.Hope they are just as soft and comfortable.I was afraid they would fall apart after the first wash due to the price of them, but they are nice, soft and wash good.I wash them using baby laundry soap and gentle cycle.The price is reasonable too.I have just done one wash with it so my only hope is that it holds up over time.If you are just looking for extra crib sheets, these are fine.However, if you are wanting the nautical print as pictured- don't count on it.The print I received is sports themed with little blue footballs and baseballs, still primarily white with blue design.Having a child that is now two years old and another one on the way, I  consider myself a mom that is in the know about lots of products for babies to toddlers on the market.I'll be reviewing the Tummy Tub today, a product I would have loved to know about and owned back when my daughter Melody was born.First and foremost, bath experiences for your baby should not be upsetting or traumatizing in any way.I was not happy with that at all and neither was she as you can tell from the photo on the right.My second child hasn't been born quite yet and with that being said, I have only been able to test and review the Tummy Tub with my two year old daughter.I will note the more I have used this tub, the more comfortable I have gotten using it.I highly recommend the Tummy Tub to all mothers.This tub costs more than a standard baby tub, but it is completely worth it.He loved to splash in the water and was happy sitting in his tub for as long as I would leave him in there.It was especially useful once my son started teething at 3 months.My son started trying to stand up in his tub by 5 months.The only downside is the size.My son outgrew the tub at 6 months.He was a large six month old (22 lbs), but it would be great if they offered a larger size for bigger babies.The Tummy Tub is a unique baby bath.It looks a little like a bucket but its deeper and taller.Your baby is held in an upright position, even if they can't sit up yet.Plus it will remind your little one of their time in the womb.It is really one of the coolest baby tubs I have come across to date.I wish it had when Willow was a newborn, but even now at seven months, she enjoyed her bath more than she ever had before.The birthing class I took was held at a store that sold these and after reading the label on the bucket I was interested.Seeing how happy and cozy the babies were sold me!Sure enough my 4wk old LOVES bath time!She actually fusses when I take her out of the tub.I have the sparkly blue tub and blue base.She sits in it like a little frog, legs tucked beneath her and her arms just floating.Super cute, super easy, and the base converts to a stool when baby outgrows the tub.We own both the BOB Ironman stroller and BOB Revolution stroller.By the time I was ready to run, my baby was mature/big enough to go in the BOB stroller in the laying down position (without his carseat adapter).I did use some extra blankets around my son and was running on very smooth, flat surfaces but I felt completely comfortable with him in both strollers at 2 months old.Bottom line is that this is a great product, but I only used it for less than 2 months.At 2 months, my baby was ready to be in the regular stroller part.I bought this car seat adaptor for my Bob not knowing if my car seat would fit.However, the combi car seat fits perfect with the adaptor.Makes the Bob worthwhile as an infant stroller and negates the need to buy two strollers, one infant and then one child, so...there you go.I bought these for the top of our stairs; we needed 2 since we have banisters on both sides of our stairs.I thought that the kits were easy enough to install.You need to play around with the positioning a little to ensure that your gate hardware is secured into the correct places.However, overall, I thought that it was easy to work with.I researched a ton of double strollers, sit and stands and tandems before I chose to purchase this particular stroller.It was really hard to find a stroller that can accommodate 2 kids that is reasonably priced, lightweight, and had the nice parent trays, etc.I belive this stroller has most of those qualities.Pros:  I love the parent organizer.The color of this stroller is very bright, but I like it because it's easily spotted in a crowd of strollers, which makes it easy to find.It doesn't make very tight turns so be careful with that.Also, I'm not sure how it will work when my son is a little taller (he's currently 33" tall).Also, it seems like if he were taller, his head might hit the umbrella?The parent organizer is in front of his face when he's sitting.It's only a problem now, but when they're a little older, they wouldn't be messing with the items in the parent tray.This stroller is wonderful!It's compact and lightweight.Both babies can fit in it and it works perfectly with the chicco keyfit 30 carseat.Would highly recommend.I lasted a whole year-- I would wear my daughter in a wrap, and usually bring our Maclaren Quest out on long trips so my older son could ride in it instead of complaining that he wanted to be carried, too.My son was now 3 1/2, but also very attached to *his* stroller and didn't want to share.I LOVE it.The only complaint is that my older kid has to get out of the back seat if I need to completely remove the diaper bag, but it's not terrible.The parent organizer is also really nice to have.I find myself bringing the stroller even when I don't expect my kids to ride in it for long because I can also fit things in the seats.I've managed small grocery trips where I put the small basket in the back seat.Other features-- The stroller has a 3 position recline, which I've only used a couple times.The seat belts are easy for me to fasten and unfasten, and it's nice having the seat belt for the back seat, too.It's only a 3-point harness in the back, but it definitely works to restrain my 3 1/2 year old, though unless he's fighting to get out of the stroller (hooray tantrums!The size of the collapsed stroller isn't tiny, but it definitely fits with no issue in our minivan (along with an extra stroller, our bike and tricycle, plus all the other miscellaneous items we keep in our trunk).You can also strap in an infant carseat to the front of the stroller, but since I didn't get the stroller until my daughter was over a year, I haven't needed to use that option.I highly recommend this stroller to anyone who has two kids and is looking for an option that isn't a big clunky double stroller.I bought my daughter her first WubbaNub, the frog, before she was even born because I had read such wonderful things about them and I was very happy I did as she LOVES her Wubbas!with the frog) or the head and keep it in her mouth MUCH easier than a regular paci and like other parents have said they're WAY easier to find.Everywhere we go everyone wants to know where we got the adorable pacifiers.My son likes the Soothie pacifiers and I came across the Wubbanub when I was searching for a pacifier clip.I love the Wubbanub.I bought the frog and the lion.My son will sometimes just hold the Wubbanub even if he is not sucking on the pacifier part.I love that it is sewn to the pacifier.We have 4 children who have LOVED their wabbanubs.By far, he's our favorite for our boys and girls.Excellent purchase.My daughter just loves it.Maybe you will feel differently.* The size of the horse is perfect!!!Not too big and not to small.* The weight is perfect.No loose seams, and well constructed.* The size Soothie attached is 3month.I bought these for the bi-fold doors on my sons closet.these don't fit our doors perfectly (with the inner "adjustment" piece, it's too tight & w/out, it's too loose).I read about some not-so-good locks online, but I decided to try these based on the positive reviews.I bought four of these locks to keep our two, 2-door closets secured.They slide easily for adult access, but our daughter cannot get to anything in the closet.Buckle is cheap.pros: Has non-skid pads on bottom, easy to wipe clean, straps are long to accommodate growthI use this pump every day and it takes just a few minutes to express a full bottle for my daughter.This pump will be a gift I give to every nursing mother.It is soo small and portable.It has good suction and works well.Comes with spare parts.It did not disappoint.Easy to clean and maintain, and very compact.I love it so far.It doesn't hurt.It's easy to use and effective.It comes with extra parts.It's wonderful, it really is!It's also great for traveling.I keep it and a spare bottle in a reusable lunch sack in the refrigerator at work and nobody even notices.it's simple to use & does the work efficiently.i bought two of these lansinoh manual pumps so i don't have to wait for it to dry up when i wash itThen one day I accidentally used it without the comfort seal piece.I think it may be because I have fairly large nipples.I suggest you try it with and without and see which way works best for you.They have beed used daily for 3 months and are still going strong.I got these just in case, but the original ones are still perfect.Recommended for the price!So I was hopeful after reading these reviews, that if I called Medela I could get the tubing for free.I told her the tubing connector part came off the tube, which it did, and I need to order replacements.She took all my info, then told me it would be $10 plus the cost of s&h!!She was stunned.I said, so, no need to process the order then.not sure if i got an unhelpful customer service rep of if their policies changed, but they did not give me free tube so i bought it from them for $10+shipping+tax.My replacement tubing arrived yesterday.I just told them I accidently melted them in the microwave, which is true.I must say, thank you Amazon for leaving these posts and letting me find out about getting them for free.It comes with a changing pad, bottle bag, zipper bag, and stroller straps.I still like the color but not what I expected.This is a great bag for a cloth-diapered baby or multiples.It is very large with many pockets on both sides of the main compartment.The inside is lined in a lighter colored fabric so it makes it easy to find what I'm looking for even in low-light.I got this as a gift from some very sweet friends.It's roomy, has lots of pockets, and I love the additions it came with - the bottle bag, zippered internal bag and changing pad.It also has straps on both ends, so you can securely attach it to your stroller.Even though there are many complaints about it being too thin or bunching up I would suggest velcro-ing it or adding a thin strip of of something heavier along the underside of the edges.This changing pad has the most surface area of any changing pad that I have seen.My baby isn't here yet... but my sister highly recommended this product to me.I think that it was worth it & that it's a cute item even still!I washed it on delicate & hung to dry & it came out just fine.I really don't see where people think it has a purple hue????It makes our little girls room so princess like.lol  Plus the price is very reasonable.This thing is solid - once it's in place, it's in place.The auto close (unless you open the gate all the way) is a useful feature as well.This is a great pressure gate and very easy to install.Bought this to keep my 9 month old in our family room.The gate will also hold open when you don't need to have it shut.I purchased another baby gate brand and now wish I would have just bought this one.This is a great pressure-mounted gate.It's super easy to open and has an automatic close feature, all you have to do is give it a little swing.It feels SLIGHTLY more sturdy, but overall I am very happy with this purchase.We hung it over the changing table (suspended from a thick string tied to a wall anchor in the ceiling), and she has been transfixed on it during every diaper change since she was three weeks old.I believe you will be very happy with this, I plan on giving them as baby gifts -- really awesome!!I bought five of these to give as 1st birthday gifts.I love that they can hold so many photos.The plastic sleeves were great and I like that you insert the photos near the binding rather than the outside edges.Less of a chance of photos falling out or kids pulling them out.And why does it have to be white?It's slightly difficult to pull the ends open and shake the pieces out the middle, but it doesn't bother me because that way my daughter can't open it herself and put the pieces back in without finding the appropriate shape.I've been pleased with it and would highly recommend it to others.Okay, every child needs to have this item, hours, and hours, and hours of great fun for the child at the same time education.It was tricky getting my baby in the tub as a newborn.It was a 2 person job to get his legs in correctly and make sure his head didn't bump on the way in.Once in, he was very happy.My baby is a very fast growing boy and he stopped fitting in it at 2 months.I think the price is good on this and the design is a little better than some of the other "bucket" tubs.He loved it, and had no problems adjusting to the water.The base is sturdy and never seemed to be 'tippy.'The handles also made it much more comfortable/easy to move around.My husband and I used this very consistently for a few months, and then just started bringing him in the bathroom tub while one of us was in the bath.I will say that this tub was very critical to us gaining confidence around the water with our baby.We certainly would not have been brave/experienced enough parents to bring a baby in the adult tub, but now that we've done it and are 'old hands' at it, it would be no problem.This tub was an invaluable set of bath time training wheels, and I'm happy we purchased it.And I think the baby loves baths/showers so much now b/c he had a gentle/in utero-esque introduction to bath time.This tub functions just as I would want it to and can't find any difference from all the advertised features of all the other tubs that are twice the price.It's sturdy and there's no fear of tilting.No separate stand needs to be purchased.Now we tried it at 3 months and she seems so uncomfortable in it.She was slouching and gruning and her mouth was getting dangerously close to swallowing water.She loves her big pink infant/toddler tub.Wish I could return the washpod!I bought it before my son was born and guess what...didn't use it.We can use a little plate to break up food and then just place it on the mat for him to pick up and eat.Great for babies just eating finger foods, or a toddler.Size is of a regular placemat that seemed more than enough for my son, but if you have one that reaches all over use 2 at a time!These are great to use with my son.He still eats off the "table/tray" and when I go to a resturant I get grossed out to think of what kind of stuff is still on that table.These are a must for anyone who has a child that doesn't eat off a plate!My daughter has problems swallowing and we have to go with specific instructions from the occupational therapist and have been working to get her able to consistently swallow without aspirating.So we cannot afford to have the wrong nipple.So if you have more than one speed, its best to mark the bags and keep them seperate that way.Dont mix them up.I ended up having to remove the cover to wash it, which is exactly the hassle I was trying to avoid in the first place.The straps had been cutting into the twins' necks.These are just as good as gerber, and I've had them a year now, and they still work great and I run them through the dishwasher frequently.The bottle holders are kind of nice 4-8" tall stalks you can put the bottle on, but the stalks aren't much use for nipples.It might be more helpful for those who use Tri-Flow bottles, since they are also made by Munchkin.Another popular option, the First Years Rack, holds most bottles/accessories in the front, but didn't hold them very well in some cases.The back area holds a scrubbing brush (which we liked - keeps it vertical and dry), but wasn't very good at holding nipples or bottle lids (from Playtex Naturalatch Bottles, in this case).I use glass bottles, and can put 6 easily on this rack.When I put 4 on a row, it will bend, but not fall over.Like that it is small and easily stored.This drying rack does its job perfectly.It folds for easy storage and is lightweight.I like the blue tips for keeping everything in place.I have two, and they fit nice and compactly on my countertop.This drying rack is nice in that it's small size and hold a decent amount of bottles.It is also very difficult to assemble the suction part to the plate.So you need to assemble the plate before placing food on it, and then be very careful that you don't dislodge the suction base.And once you get everything in place perfectly, your baby will promptly and easily lift the plate from their tray anyways!It's called "Lil Trainer" because its never to early to start training your baby to become a savvy consumer!!!The suction base is really a pain to put on, especially if you've already filled the plate with food and can't flip the plate over.The rim is way too easy to get off and my son figured out how to do it pretty quickly.The fork, although safe, isn't that functional since it's nearly impossible to stab pieces of food unless they are really billowy and thick.This does not fit the bill since the suction base keeps coming off with the gentlest nudge.The suction base is next to impossible to slip back on to the bowl, the suction base is not dishwasher or m/w safe.So you do have to take it off all the time for wash up.Even the space agey lip around the bowl keeps coming off with a nudge of their fork or spoon while they are eating providing distraction and taking away from mealtime.Love these bowls.I got these bowls not realizing that they are intended for old babies where as my son was 4 months when i started using them.I love themThe lid is clear and snaps on nice and tight, and the bowls are the perfect size for starting solids with my little guy.And I know they'll come in handy for years to come....they're perfect for cheerios and goldfish on the go down the road.I make most of my own baby food.Highly recommend.Update:  After a few months these bowls continue to hold up well after being dropped many times by my 13mo old and washed many time in the dishwasher (upper rack.)Great value!I've found another small container that I like better for packing and freezer storage.They are smaller than these bowls, but I usually don't need an 8 oz size.The Sure Lid containers have attached lids - which are awesome.They are truly leakproof and are great for tons of uses.Great job at cleaning the bottles fast and thoroughly but I am one my 3 brush and my son is only 8 months old.I would have given perfect review if they were a little sturdier.Only brush I have used but I like it a lot.The sponge is a little fragile, mine already has some tears (only a couple of weeks old) and some bristles are bent.Brush is okay, but the nipple brush is too rough to use.Nipple brush rough and not dense, thus hard to thoroughly clean a nipple.I love this bottle brush.I prefer the sponge tip it gives you the squeaky clean sound while your cleaning and cleans perfectly!The tiny brush inside the bottom part is good  as well.The size, shape and design are great for cleaning bottles/parts.Unfortunately, after only a few easy uses, the bristles on my brush started to fall out.I always buy this type of bottle brush to wash our bottles.Since brushes should only be kept for a month or so before they start growing bacteria and spreading germs, you don't want to spend a lot of money on something you're only going to keep around for 30 days, maybe 60 if you are very careful about keeping it upright and untouched while it dries.This brush fits in small medela bottles, on up to larger sippy cups that we use now.And the little handy nipple brush is also versatile from bottles to sippy cup lids.To the mothers that say theirs rust or wear out after a while, I say read the package.I LOVE this design!!The sponge at the top gets into the bottom of larger bottles and cleans wonderfully!I wash bottles by hand 2 times a day and use this every time.The only down side is that I have had to replace it 2X already because the sponge breaks apart and the 4 parts of the X it creates break off.The brush we had for cups and other dishes didn't fit in the bottles we had, so I bought this.It works.I've been using it for the better part of a year, and haven't had any issues.I've seen brushes with a base, and that would probably work out better, but this one is just fine.It's a great deal for the combo pack, as with most other dispensers, you only get the one dispenser and not a bonus one.These are so easy to use and very practical.It is nice to have premeasured amounts to make a bottle on the go!Love this dispenser.This set is great quality.These are great!Of course they're a little hard to open, because if they were easy there might be a chance they'd open when you didn't want them to.Love that this is a combo pack, too.I've used the little one with the short trips to visit the neighbor.Colors are bright and pretty.These dispensers are wonderful!Also since there are 3 separate compartments, you can put different amounts in each one, so that if your baby isn't as hungry, you can opt to give  him a specific amount, rather than dump a whole individual to-go formula packet in.Being able to measure out formula before you need it, and then just dump it in and add the water.. brilliant!These are good quality.I haven't 'used' them yet as my little guy won't be here for a few more months, but my friends with kids saw these and thought it was an awesome idea :) Great price too!These will be perfect for "on the go" when we're away from home..The cap fits tightly, but isn't overly difficult to remove.Although you can't pick your color and may end up with pink for you boy... it's a great item and is better than any others i have used with my 4 kidsSwitch a Roos would make my now crawling 8 month old so much more containable!I have 5 month old twins and they both enjoy chewing on "Chewy Fish"..Sometimes they enjoy the crinkly fins and sometimes they like the chewy fish nose.Great purchase.It looks like our baby would have enjoyed it if it had.We use these cups for water.they can't go under it because humans don't twist that way (even them who can climb on anything) so my 2 year old son tries to climb over it if I don't get to him quick enough & it gives me a heart attack each time I catch him trying that b/che'll fall & hit his head one of these days if I don't grab him quick enough.This is a must have for the Bob.It makes walks easy with our 2 year old and newborn.Otherwise, no complaints from us!The reviews stating that it dosnt fit most sippy cups are true but thats what the cup holders on the inside of the seat are for, and yes the trays are high and wont be good for 12m old, but my 31lb 3 year old can reach them just fine and they are just below chin level practically!I think I bought every other spoon and fork out there until I found these.These are the best for ages 12-24 months.They're not too big for little mouths, but still with a decent size scoop.I tried multiple spoons when my son was learning to eat.He loved feeding himself yogurt, but none of the spoons I tried were deep enough to keep the yogurt in the spoon.They're easy to grip and deep enough to hold food.My now 3 year old son still uses them and my 19 month old does too.These have been helpful in moving our 15 month old daughter into a spoon/fork mindset.She is still working on using the fork, which will be the case for the next several months, but seems to enjoy them.You get 2 sets when you order, so that was nice.I bought this set when my grandchild came to visit and she enjoyed being fed with them.The shape make it very comfortable to feed her and I am sure she will enjoy them as she starts feeding herself.Well worth their cost.Nice feel and grip for my son, slant of spoon is helpful (compared to others) for his learning to self-feed.Cute colors.It would be nice to see these in a flexible design but I'm not aware of any.I love Evenflo glass bottles!A month ago, he was refusing his favorite bottles, so I tried one of these again.It is sturdy and easy to clean.I haven't ever dropped one or subjected one to rapid temperature change.These are a good price and my only wish is that they were the wide neck bottles so it wouldn't be so hard to get the powder in the bottle!We have loved this dishwasher basket for various uses over the past 5+ years since our daughter (and then son) were born.It is great for bottle nipples, bottle parts, small spoons, sippy cup valves, and just about anything.Positives?Easy to use, holds all manner of items including bottle nipples, bottle parts, small spoons, forks knives, sippy cup valves and lids, and other small non-baby itemsComplaints?I ended up not using it for straws.It's capacity is limited, so in a two working parent household with two kids, we needed 2-3 of these for each daily load.I would have happily purchased a larger version.All in all - highly recommended!The basket fit nicely in the top rack of my dishwasher.I decided to buy this on online to have it shipped across the country when I was traveling with my baby.That said, it doesn't quite get five stars because 1) as others said, if you use bigger nipples, they have to be placed every-other and 2) the top can't fit bigger straw cup tops.This was definitely worth the purchase.Good size basket, fits stuff for at least 5 of my born bottles.you might as well just hand wash your child's dishes and bottles.This works great for us.It fits in the dishwasher perfectly(a GE Profile) and it fits the nipples in the top as it says it should.My only complaint for this product is that doesn't fit as many wide mouth nipples as it shows in the picture (such as The First Year Breastflow or Dr. Brown's wide mouth).Other than that it works great and I'd highly recommend it.I purchased this because a friend recommended it to me.Very practical, and it fits the bigger bottle nipples.I really like that it keeps small items from falling into the bottom of the dishwaser which is really gross.After i bought this item (not thinking) i'm not sure if i can use it.But will try and put the niples inside and see what happens but other then that it's worth getting!But, like I said, it does the job.I really dig this item because you can just cram in all the little pieces of the bottle accessories and sippy cup accessories and not have to worry about losing any pieces.Functionally I think they are fine, and the pictures are cute.. but it didn't work out for us.Happy they are BPA free.Easy to use.Easy to change.Now, it is all i use...very very easy!No need for a separate mattress pad or a spare sheet bought separately.The piddle pads are also quilted, which is a nice touch.I contacted the company and they said that they don't offer it because the flannel doesn't keep its shape.Well, I ended up sewing a piece of prewashed flannel onto one of the top sheets and it worked just fine.My mother had originally bought me a diaper genie.It seemed like it would work with cloth diapers so we bought it.It fit perfectly, and then the dirty cloth diapers and wipes are simply pushed through the door on top.Maybe it's just in the way that I had last opened the pail - I'm going to check it out further.If it is a design flaw, I'll return it and keep searching for that "perfect cloth diapering pail".I am a first time mother and I was looking for something comfortable and easy to use.The moby wrap was great around the house with my newborn.Hope this helps!Once you read through the instruction booklet, tying the wrap was really easy to do.And after a couple of practice runs getting my little one in there, it turned out to be really easy to use.I heard about this wrap and saw it demoed at my Bradley class.Once I saw how easy it was to wrap the Moby I was interested.I this one and love it!My 4wk old has been in it since 5 days old and she loves it.It keeps her snug against my chest, warm, and covered.My only reget is that I didn't order another one to rotate when it needs a wash!I received this 3 pack as a shower gift and I love them.I am having twins so the more the better.I also got a set from Carter's and they honestly are a bit softer I think which I like.They are super soft, very pretty and do their job of keeping baby warm after bath time.I usually double up with an extra towel to keep my baby extra warm but that's just because most baby towels are on the thinner side.I got the same style of towels through SpaSilk and they are at least 100% thicker & softer.These are great paccifiers.The nipple is sturdy, easy to clean and easy to use ANY binky clip with.It's held up VERY well and there aren't even bite marks on it.Nuk has been around for many years, so they know what they are doing when it comes to pacis and bottles.If you get something that dosent seem sturdy.My son is exclusively breastfed and these paci's were reccommended to me by a lactation consultant.I also use the Nuk bottles now that I'm back at work and pumping because they are the same shape as the paci's.They do collect lint at the base of the nipple as one reviewer said, but it's really not a big deal and you just pick it right out.The one thing I don't like is when you wash them, some soap and water can get inside the nipple if you're not careful, but i've found that to be the case with all paci's that aren't all one molded piece.Our baby loves the Soothies, so we thought this would be a cute attacher.We will continue to try as she gets older, but we prefer the Booginhead attacher or the Wubbanub to keep the paci from slipping away.When it was attached to the pacifier, it was so awkward and heavy that my daughter could not keep her pacifier in her mouth - she used it more as a chewing toy than as a pacifier attacher.When I bought this a couple of years ago, it was the only option I saw in stores for a soothie pacifier clip but thankfully there are other, non-bulky options available now - I recommend going with one of those.It does the job for us, but like previous posters have mentioned, it is large, and somewhat heavy.We've used it in my son's room since he was born.When my son was a baby this mat was a perfect soft spot for tummy time (and easy to clean up drool).Now it's a comfortable place for my husband and I to get on the floor with our son to do puzzles, play with cars, or read books.It's very attractive and a great rug alternative.Now that Europe is banning similar play mats because of the dangerous chemicals used to make them, I'm glad I paid extra for a mat that's been tested to be safe and doesn't contain toxins.I was looking for some kid-friendly flooring for our new baby's room, and this is absolutely perfect!It's nice and soft so its super comfortable to sit on the floor and play with our baby.It will also be really great for when he first starts walking.On top of the great material, I love the colors that the Playspot comes in!Its not too baby-ish and goes with the rest of the decor of the nursery and our house.We also love that its like a puzzle, and we can mix and match the squares and circles!I bought one set of green/brown for my then 6-month old baby.I like them so much I bought a 2nd set to create a bigger space.I didn't connect the 2 sets together but one could do that without purchasing additional connectors.Very solid performer.awesome!!The sound is clear with no interference (we do live in a single family home).The monitor is sturdy, i've dropped it several times.Great you hear everything .even when she breath, no interference what so ever.You can here your wife mumble too.lolThis works really well.It has a good range, and is very sensitive to sounds.There is also some other occasional interference it will pick up.My daughter has received 2 of this doll as gifts and I kept both!My sister in law recommended and sent some of this brand toy after my niece fell in love with them.The doll itself is soft and lovable.The size is good for even smaller babies, but not too small either.It seems sturdy even when fully reclined.I did not have trouble with color as some of the other reviewers.I ordered cherry/fawn and it looks the same as in the photo.The glider arrived in good condition with all parts present.It was easy to put together.The instructions were easy to follow.It is pretty comfortable.The mattress fits perfectly in our Europa Baby Geneva crib.Nice and snug.The little one is not here yet so I can't speak as to how it will hold up but I'm happy with the fit and firmness.Very firm, heavy mattress with a solid feel.Coil count, not mentioned online, is 118. Review the guidlelines for mattresses at Expectant Mother's Guide.com.Fits the bill fabulously with great support, border rods, and multiple laminated covers.Purchased with a toddler bed for a toddler who sleeps comfortably on her parents' super firm Seally Posturpedic.No huge complaints about this, except that it is not what I would call super firm.If you're on the fence and want a very solid, firm mattress; you may want to splurge on another choice!The mattress is easily cleaned.We also measured our crib first and the mattress fit nice and snug.We ordered this for our nursery and we really liked it and thought the price was very reasonable.BUT, when we opened it up, the mattress was ripped in two places.We kept it because the rips were manageable and figured we could just buy another one if we needed-but it was just an annoyance.Fits perfectly in our crib (DaVinci Kalani Convertible Crib in Espresso) and works great!The price is great!It's a nice mattress.Nothing exceptional about it but I like it.It's a very tight fit in my 57.0" wide crib.affordable, relatively firm and fits our Graco cribGraco Victoria Non Drop Side 5 In 1 Convertible Crib Whitealmost too perfectly.This mattress is just what we were looking for - very firm but doesn't seem too uncomfortable.Have already recommended this mattress to a few other parents.Super flexible and attaches anywhere.Baby loves it.I'm surprised it's not a number one registry item..I would always buy this as a baby gift since I loved it so much.I attached this in pretty much everything my son had:  Bassinet, car seat, stroller, bouncer, table, desk, etc etc.Just one of the grip made of rubber/plastic got partially ripped off due to my son pulling on the various toys especially the pinwheel (pull on a ball with a bell inside like a lawnmower and it turns the pinwheel)Anyways due to not being attached correctly and/or due to my son being hyper and strong, pulling it like crazy, the rubber part got ripped a bit but it still attaches and he is still playing with it after 9 months.It was so cute watching him trying figure out cause and effect with the ball and the pin wheel rotating (around 2-3month).few weeks ago I saw my son playing with his bouncer so i attached the arch.Makes a great present.Going to be my new born niece as a present.My baby loves this arch and so do I!!!So I usually pull the little fan part or roll the ball with the beads inside.I just love how you can attach it easily to so many things.He loves this arch!!!I got the Recaro Signo G2 Convertible carseat for my daughter and HATED that there was no toy bar or toy item that could attach to this.My mother in law bought this for my son.he's only 2 months old right now, so he's just now starting to even look at it.the clamps and the way the entire thing can bend different ways is awesome!Not only online but even on the box it came in!But it's still pretty awesome.He loves it!Not only does it keep him entertained in his carseat, it easily attaches to his stroller for walks as well.I highly recommend this toy arch!However, it did break after one summer of use.It is now attached to my kayak by way of duct tape, so it's still somewhat useable, as long as it stays in one spot.So, my son did not like to ride in my husband's car at all.He would often cry and fuss.I bought the tiny love sunny stroll arch and now he no longer cries in the car!!Basically - it's very entertaining for him.I had read some reviews that said they couldn't fasten it - but it fits great on my son's car seat.We also took it to his 2-month well appointment and it helped distract him after he got his vaccines.I bought this toy to attached to my twins car seats.It provides fun while we are traveling as they love all the bright colors, etc...Recently they have learned how to spin the toys attached to the arch so now its like a new toy all over again.My twins love chewing on the attached, crinkle teether.or when I'm trying to feed one baby and need something fun and quick to use with the other.My 4 month old daughter loves this!It's made the time in the carseat much more entertaining for her.Very affordable and fun!And my son absolutely loves playing with it.He especially loves the butterfly since its easiest to catch and hold and loves continually to pull on it.My daughter absolutely loves her musical turtles!She enjoys the music and also seems to be amused by the little turtle on top that winds/moves.I LOVE this diaper caddy!It's so adorable and is very practical.One side PERFECTLY holds a container of wipes, and the other side allows ample space for diapers, lotion, powder, and hand sanitizer.The caddy also comes with a changing mat that folds up easily and fits into it's own pocket of the caddy.The pattern is sooo cute--I don't mind having this item just laying around the house.It looks great with our modern decor and doesn't scream "I have a baby!"when we have company.I bought one set of these burp cloths before our son was born - he is now 10wks old and we have since purchased 3 additional sets!!I don't think I would have bought it if I had to do it over again.I just wish I had paid attention to reviewers who said don't fold your stroller with it on, we bent the rim of the caddy the first time we used it but it bent back and still works great.At first I thought it was great.I bought this to use on my large BabyJogger II-20, which was given to me by a friend w/big kids now.This is at least equal to the BabyJogger brand console (an extra $30 after buying a $220 stroller) on my City Mini, honestly.I have no complaints, especially for the price!this is a great caddy for umbrella strollers.I would give it 5 stars if there was a mechanism that would make it not sway when I'm going over some bumps or onto the sidewalk, but overall, I'm greatly satisfied.We purchased this to go on our City Mini Double stroller for a recent trip to Disney World.The stroller folded up with it still attached, and it was a great spot for drinks, cell phones, maps, baby shoes, etc.He said that his company rented out the same stroller and had the BJ parent accessory, but it was not as substantial.It is perfect and can stay attached even when I collapse the stroller.This works well with my Combi Stroller.It keeps it shape and holds Venti size Starbucks cups just fine.The velcro is quite large so it can adjust nicely.this is the best cup holder/console i have seen out there.it fits perfectly on my baby jogger city mini and valco trimode.I bought this to put on my Graco Ipo umbrella stroller and it fits great.It attached easily with 2 velcros and stays on tight.Made of good quality fabric and holds quite a bit.We added this to our UPPA baby stroller and have been very happy with it.Holds keys, cells, cups, snacks, etc.GREAT purchase!This is great.You can't see it in the picture but there is a small zippered pocket in the center.Easy to use.We use this parent tray with different strollers.We first purchased this to avoid using the 2 lbs Jeep parent tray, which cannot hold cups & sport bottles.I bought this for my Maclaren Techno Stroller and at first I loved it.Over all I would not buy this item again.I have a Munkin Cup holder that I use for my Camelbak water bottle now.I bought this to use with my Baby Jogger City Mini that doesn't have any sort of cup holder or parent compartment.I put this on my Baby Jogger City Mini when it came in, and have removed it several times to use on a Graco Mosaic stroller.The velcro is awesome and I've never worried about it coming off either stroller.I just wrapped it tightly around, and it's snug as can be.Works great and will buy another one if I ever need more than the one I have now.I bought this item a few days ago, and I am very happy with it.I have it attached to the handle of my Baby Jogger City Mini stroller.I can leave it attached all of the time, as it does not impede the fold of the stroller.We took a trip to the zoo yesterday, and I loaded it up with:Smart phone in the small mesh zipper pocket (this would also be a good area for a small wallet).27 oz Klean Kanteen bottle in one of the drink holders.Sunglasses in the other drink holder (another Klean Kanteen bottle would have fit however).Medium size camera, small bag of cookies, and a zoo map in the main compartment...with some room left to spare.The velcro straps are very strong.My only small complaint is that the Sunshine Kids logo is a bit cheesy looking.I might try turning it around so it faces the rear of the stroller and can't be seen.Our City Mini doesn't have any sort of tray or cup holders so this purchase was a must.Great purchase!I bought them for my son 18 months who is walking already, but he falls down a lot on his knees.Also I didin't find the material scratchy as another reviewer mentioned.Overall it is great quality for 5$.This bag fits a 10-oz nissan stainless steel thermos, and the equivalent of a yogurt container, an apple, and a small ziploc bag of nuts or crackers.The bunny model, while adorable, is a bit awkward--it protrudes to make the 3-D face of the bunny, so it is hard to stuff in other bags, and the curved design that tapers toward the top makes it hard to fit containers.And this is unacceptable, considering that in my daycare the staff keeps the bags and opens them for lunchtime--meaning, my toddler has not been playing with the zipper at all.The bag wipes clean easy inside--but I have some concerns about the material.Both brands have given me great durability in backpacks (including the zippers) so I hope to have a better experience with them.And the color is right on with the picture.It is quilted and thick and catches baby drool, I haven't had anything leak through yet.It also stays in place very well, nice tight fit.I love this, it fits the Graco perfect.It fits my old pack n play perfectly.My pack n play is from 2005 and it does it's job.All in all though for the price, it's a great pillow.Also, the shape needs to be contoured better.In the end, I'm still using the pillow but have not reduced my pillow use.I am picky about my pillow, and have one I love.I am 5'3" tall, so I figured it would be long enough.It is great how you can use it several different ways.The quality is good.Since I am a plus sized girl, it fit me a lot better than my Boppy.So this turned out to be a great purchase even though I didn't end up using it for what I had intended.It's ok and we'll use it but it's not my first choice in diapers.Without being able to pull some of the extra padding out it's just too much for my son to be comfortable in.The only complaint I have is it's hard to reshape them when they dry....so many choices!After studying amazon.com, I saw 12 different companies under "washable nursing pads" at the start of this project.I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far, each brand's strengths were as follows:>Kushies absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers,>La Leche League appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras,>Medela was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time,>NuAngel was very affordable.Organic?, Made in USA/Canada?, Fair Trade?, Construction Material?2-second squirt of 3ml absorbed in same 2 seconds.Still fresh white color after 2 months use.Variable speed of absorption.13-40 seconds to absorb 3ml--improved after 2 months use.Excellent outer doubler.95% Cotton/5% Polyester, outer shell 100% cotton, seamless deep contour, 4 pads/pk.MEDELA:Single layer/light  3 starInner doubler  3 starOuter doubler  2 starheavy night solo  1 starRate of absorption  2 star: (3ml in 23 sec), 3ml within 5-10 seconds after couple months of useShirt test  - back of pad damp in 20 minutes, not visible on shirt (3ml)Appearance  3 starAbsorbed 3ml in 23sec, absorption improved thereafter following additional months of use.White & patterns absorb more quickly than natural tone (3ml in 24sec), absorption improved thereafter following additional month of use.Probably best to use white alone or as inner doubler depending on anticipated flow, and natural tone as outer or alone if only slowly dripping.May work especially well for smaller sizes like A or B.I'm still hopeful that the other 2/3 of these brands can provide a more efficient answer.This review goes into more detail at "ecofriendlyreviews.blogspot.com"Both of our babies only munched on the ears and face at the first time.They had no interest in the barking, moving, etc.Later they don't play with it at all.Loved this so much the day care kids asked if he could bring it to day careHe immitates the barking noises it makes.When baby stops paying attention to it, it stops moving.He is 160lbs so I'm sure even a screwed in gate would have come off.I reinstalled using a 5ft level and checked to make sure it was perfectly installed - again.The second time it came off happened when our cat (all 9lbs of his scrawny self) jumped off from the top of it.While trying to measure/screw the tension bolts into place it can be a little unwieldy to line everything up.The gate looks very nice, seems to be made well, and the closing/opening mechanism is smooth.This was super easy to install and works great.I was a little concerned because I live in an old place with narrow doorways (28") but with a little work, it went in just fine.I like the metal construction.The opening is wide, so passing through while carrying the baby or any number of large, baby-related items is no problem.Highly recommend.I checked the fiber content label and it says the waterproof backing is vinyl-coated polyester.Not sure if this vinyl coating is pthalate-free, plus it just stinks, so I'm returning it.This pad is really soft and it contains leaks when they happen which with my son, who loves to pee as soon as I get his diaper off, is a lot.Received this item in the mail today.It is a great size and a great price.I will have to see how it holds up in the wash but if all goes well, I will probably get a couple more for backup.Love it!LOVE this changing pad - use one every time I change diapers on the bed (until baby moves to nursery with changing table).Very soft cloth on one side (waterproof on other), large pad, washes nicely (stains come out easily).Highly recommend!!I also use it to change diapers on top of my bed so I don't have to go upstairs to the nursery everytime.I've washed them many many times and although they ball a tiny bit, they have held up really really well.Highly recommend!My hubby and I got one of these for our diaper bag and loved it so much we bought two more!We use them on top of our changing pad at home as a little extra insurance against leaks.Like what another reviewer said "No gym is going to be absolutely perfect" but this gets the job done and for the amount of time my baby has used it and had fun with it, it is worth the money.Very poor choice of material for this age group which put everything in their mouth.My son started rolling within a day of using this mat.Honestly, my son is 7 mo.I had that on his crib since birth and he loves it.I catch her looking at the mirror, though I wish it were a real mirror and not one of those cheap, distorted mirrors that do not give you an accurate reflection of yourself (it is the kind that stretches the image of your face).She also LOVES the little aqua blue octopus with the rattle ball on the end.She will hit that and smile often.This gym is very bright and colorful, easy to set up and easy to clean.Very nice.Overall I am very happy with it.We bought this for our newborn daughter and she loved it from birth.We loved the price too!This gym is fine for small babies.She laid on it and liked the octopus and the music when she was finally old enough to activate and touch the items herself.Rather we hung other items from links from the hanging tabs that were within her reach or easily viewable.We also put the aquarium on the side attached to the 2 poles and it caused one of the poles to sag slightly.The material does wash pretty well ( the underneath had some pillage) which is good because the mat is made of a slippery material that caused her to sweat profusely- and she used the gym in the winter months.But it just seemed that once it become really age appropriate she outgrew it.My son loves this toy every since he could put his mouth around the leg (around 3 month)the leg fits in his mouth perfectly and sometimes it'll say a color when he's munching on it.There's a particular one that he likes to dance to.I received this item very quickly and I think that this is very soft and perfect for the baby.There are lots of color options to learn and just love this item.I especially love it when she giggles.He is a little smaller than I expected, which is fine.Still great item.Good, not great; it's too sensitive and the music starts way to easy; it's ok but not as fun as I expected.Bummed, since it is a fun and playful toy.My son still likes to play with it though.My son loves this toy and smiles at it all the time.He can make the music start easily.Right now he mostly tries to eat it but eventually I think the colored legs will be neat.It would be nice if it could stay on the floor so my son could look at it when he is on his tummy.The version I bought didn't have the hook on top but I bet that is a nice addition to take along in the stroller.My daughter loves this!I got this at a festival and had is personalized with my daughters name on it!It is incredibly soft and very easy for my lil girl to hold on to.Love it!My 13 month old son loves this blanket.If there were only room for three of us in the life raft, I think I'd be waving to my wife and son and this damn blanket from the sinking ship.My kid doesn't seem to care, but I've heard that some babies are not so easily fooled.Wonderful lovey.Soft and perfect for snuggling.My son loves to suck on the trunk.As soon as we give him Lovey, he gets into "bedtime" mode and calms down and starts snuggling.I bought 3 to rotate after every 2-3 days (it gets grimey after a couple days of "loving") and it's the perfect amount for 2 in the wash and 1 in use.They still look new after over a year.Highly recommend.THe Monkey Angel Dear "lovey" is perfect for night time for my son.This is perfect - big enough for him to cuddle, but small enough that I'm not afraid to have it in the crib with him.The small monkey head is great for grabbing onto - my son loves to "hug" his monkey each night, and looks for it in the crib.I've washed the blanket several dozen times and it is still in good shape and stayed soft and the color stayed vibrant, and the little monkey head remains firm.This gets a lot of wear and tear - chewing, dragging, drooling, and throwing - from my son, and I'm impressed with how well it's lasted.I highly recommend this if you're looking for a lovey for your child.100% Cotton fabrics are highly recommended for they are natural and cool.Being highly absorbent with wet strength, it can withstand frequent washing at high temperature.It's the best fabric for babies and children because they cause less irritation to a baby's delicate skin.I have recommended this to friends.It is of good quality.It is thick enough that I believe that it will protect my leather seats.It also comes up high enough in the back to protect the entire seat from my 2 year old son's carseat.I LOVE this carseat protector!I would love to see these in White!Very good quality.[Updated June 2013]I have been using it for over 4 years now, and I have bought 3 more last few years.The mats and my leather seats are still in excellent condition.I park my car outdoor everyday at work, but I live in southern California and it's not that hot here even in summer.So, depending on where you live, this mat may or may not be a good choice for you.It fits nicely under the car seat and is non-slip so the seat is still really safe.The design for this mirror is good, it's flexible and helps view little ones facing forward in their carseat.It warps along the edges from the get-go and causes a very distorted image.They are very fast and I love that they are washable.I think the quality however is great.Very soft after the first few washes and has held up very well through repeated washings.This rain shield is so easy to use.The air vents are large enough to make me feel confident that he is getting enough air flow, but they do not let a lot of cold air in.Between this and the footmuff he stays really warm and dry.The best part is the opening at the top so I can safely grab the carseat handle!We are Maxi Cosi buyers and decide to give something else a try and it did not work!We bought the infant seat and the Quinny and we are not regretful, besides the colors are great and the side protection is a safety feature that is necessary!Yes, she is growing up...sigh!We loved the looks and size of this seat - thought it would be a great bridge from an infant seat to a booster seat and allow us to keep our daughter rear facing for awhile longer.Went ahead and bought the larger and admittedly uglier Britax marathon - had it installed in 5 minutes.My son loves this chair.We got this chair when my son was 12mo.I loved that it had the option for rear and face forward.My son loves it so I guess I cant complain.I also love how you can put the straps on the side of the chair for easy in and out for child.I thought this was going to be adorable.Quality is fair....but reasonable given the price.It's perfect for my jungle nursery, and I think it can be gender-neutral.The lamp is adorable and made quite well.The only complaint I have is that it is SO loud to turn off and on.I have to turn it off before I put my son to sleep or pulling the on/off cord will wake him up.This is a nice switch plate.It matches the Nojo Jungle Babies items perfectly.My only complaint, if you can call it that, is the colors are a little faint.I used one of these to increase the superyard to 19sqft.Easy to install and well crafted.We bought two of these to configure as a large playpen for our daughter.Each of the hinges can be tightened so that if you configure it as a square, it is still quite sturdy.So far she loves that she has the freedom to move around in this area.Didn't work for us.I think it's much better for their development to create a "do touch" environment.I can pour myself a bowl of cereal every morning, visit the bathroom when I need to, change the laundry over, even take the occasional shower without worrying that my little one will be chewing on lamp chords or tumbling down the basement stairs.My one complaint is that, with only six sides, this is really very small.Take that into consideration when doing a cost comparison.Overall, though, I highly recommend having a pen for your crawling baby.It is a lifesaver for me (figuratively) and for my curious baby (maybe literally).The gate is setup straight across the entry to the room and is anchored into studs in the walls.The gate works well and across this distance it flexes, but is sturdy.It's sturdy and well made.The 30 inch height is perfect for keeping the little ones secured.It has flexible configuration options as each panel can be placed at different angles.This was not clearly advertised in the description, but each panel can be placed at odd angles (not just 10 degree increments like the Kidco, but any angle up to 180 degrees) and locked in place.The wall mounts can be tricky, but there were wall templates included to help mark the spot where screws can be inserted.I would definitely recommend this gate to other parents.These gates are working well thus far.They are nicely made and look nice.My little one is not yet walking but is pulling up so I don't know yet how they will hold up to full blown forces!Pros:Welded metal and nicely madeHave rubber pads and don't scratch floorsExtra long widths to span those "open room" concept gapsConfigurableHas a gateCons:Gate is narrowMounting hardware is plastic (should be made of metal to be stronger)Have to be laid out in a curve shape to provide the necessary strength and not put too much load on the plastic hardware.I use this extender in conjunction with theNorth States 3 in 1 Metal Superyard  - 3 Gates in 1.The Superyard is great in that it is sturdy, neat, safe, and easy to set up.The extension was well worth the extra investment.It's just wonderful to have somewhere to set my daughter while I'm cooking or doing laundry or going to the bathroom.Nice to know she can't go getting stuck under the couch or teething on wires or falling down stairs or whatever other trouble she might get into in 30 seconds while I have my back turned.My only wish is that this extender had a gate piece in it so that I could have easy access to the inside from both ends.No big deal, though.This toy is simple and fun!The set sticks to the wall of the bath and shower, the pieces stick to each other, and they also float.The item IS for ages 3+, and a determined toddler could really chew these up if he or she wanted to, but I watch my son, and we've had no problems!Love the pirate theme, it's different than what most kids have, and works great for a boy or a girl.And she has loved her since she opened her.This princess was slightly bigger than I expected her to be when she arrived, but that's a positive thing.I would highly recommend this princess for other little girls.the black and white pattern is very eye catching for babies underneath the flower petals and it makes them want to grab it.This combines the best of all!Highly recommend!Princess SophieThe recline feature was fantastic when my son was 2-4 months old and I was just looking for a place to safely put him in the kitchen while I cooked dinner.The downsides of this high chair are (1) no crotch bar in the seat -- you cannot strap the baby in one-handed because he'll slip out if he wiggles the tiniest bit before you get him buckled in; (2) the crotch bar is attached to the tray -- my son constantly kicks at it when I'm trying to put the tray on the chair; (3) you need three hands to put the tray on -- the arms of the chair have to be perfectly lined up with the grooves in the tray while you simultaneously depress the button on the center of the front of the tray.Add a squirmy baby into the mix, and it usually takes two people to get the tray onto the chair.Finally, because the crotch bar is attached to the tray itself, you can't take the tray off to put the tray down anywhere if there's any kind of food on it that might roll or drip off.It takes up a lot of floor space (21" x 29") when in use.Not ideal for small rooms.2.These are by far the best seats.Fits my child better and is more comfortable.These seats also look great.Highly recommend.The bib is the perfect size for my son, who is now 11 months old.It's such a cute design, but the best feature of this bib is its slick, wipe down, waterproof surface.In this case, I used a smaller cloth bib underneath the Bumkins as back-up.However, since I make homemade baby food, and my son is old enough to eat thicker textures now, I have no problems with this anymore.This bib is great!Very cute, vibrant colors.Nice waterproof bib that he can't pull off.The pocket is great for catching what he spits out.I bought this thinking it was a Superbib.We have 2 Superbibs and love them.These bibs wash well and are so cute for baby boys.They are the smaller size, so it's perfect for my 7 year old.It's easy to wash.But the neck seems very tight to me.I have the Graco IPO in the "Vegas" pattern.I received it in the summer of 2009 before my son was born.Right out of the box, I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to assemble--no tools needed, good instructions, easy for a wimp like me to assemble alone.I had no trouble keeping the canopy in place or open, and the seat went upright with little effort, staying that way until I pushed the little release mechanism.Once it was together, I popped my 6 month old in it, and fumbled a bit with the straps.Smooth ride, turns easily and one-handed, and ALL the wheels made contact with the ground (unlike some other reviewers' experiences).The seat stayed in an upright position the whole time despite my son's efforts to escape.Overall, this was a great stoller experience.I would highly recommend this to anyone.I ended up throwing these out.The mesh is too stretchy and doesn't hold the items very tightly.I also use them for the things that are too small for the dishwasher that I normally have to wash and dry by hand.I just wish the manufacturers had included instructions on how to get them open.I am sure the people who are having trouble getting them to stay shut are the ones that forcefully "yanked" them open.Just slide the two tabs towards each other and pull gently.It is a little harder than this to get them out of the packaging, but be patient and don't force them.I love the whole set from "The fisrt years" meaning the "Breastflow" concept .I didn't have any colicky issues with my son, what so ever.Anyway, he's six months old now and he still loves them, we are using the second stage of nipples.You have to be careful though because the inner nipple is highly sensitive to heat!Then we bought the fast flow and my daughter hated them because they were too fast (she is 5 months old).We went back to the original slow flow.I decided to give these a try when I was going back to work and I noticed that my baby sucks in a lot more air.So, I went back to using Dr. Browns glass bottles.At first, I thought this might be a frivolous item, but knowing me, I purchased it anyways  - I'm glad I did.My daughter loves laying on it and it's very convenient to move from room to room.It works great.It's SO SO SO soft and a great place for baby to rest and play.It's also a nice soft spot for changing clothes (or diapers if you're daring!)I've always air dried it just to be safe.We love it!It is SUPER soft and the size is perfect.The kitty one is so cute and perfect for our daughter since we have a cat that she adores.I saw the others and they look really sweet as well.The only negative: it seems to shed slightly (our daughter does love to pull on the fur though).I will consider giving this for baby showers in the future!The pillow is very large, and very soft, both brilliant!Our baby loves it, and appears to be comfortable while laying on both the tummy and the back.We did have to wash it when we first got it, as our baby got red bumps on her face after laying on this.It is very easy to wash, and dries fairly quickly.Would recommend as a comfortable place for baby to take a nap under your watchful eye (So he/she doesn't decide to roll off the thing!).It looks great, is super soft, and a very good size (For a 2 month old at least, with plenty space to grow into!)This was given as a gift to our son and we love it!So much that we give it as a gift now!She wanted to lay on it and look at all the pictures.It is a great size and catches all the food, saving our wood floor.I am a big fan and think it is definitely worth the price.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.When my husband and i down sized to a small apartment i purchased this to keep our floor baby food free without a highchair.it is just the right size to catch flying food in what ever direction.i have recommended it to several of my friends who all love it as well.the dinosaur design also went over well with my husband!I just love this mat, sturdy and easy to clean.I recommend this to any parent.Well anyway these are great at holding pee and poop without soaking the floor or things "falling out."If you're going to try the same method of potty training I recommend you spend a little extra money and buy the Gerber training pants.They're awesome!I bought these for my 2yr old and they have been really good.My son is petite so I was glad to find Gerber still selling these in 18mos!They are soft, easy for kids to pull on and off and my son loves them.These aren't quite as thick as Potty Patty undies, which, depending on your needs, may be a plus or minus.A very nice classic training pant.These are great and very soft for my 22 month old.However, these were a good alternative, and very comfortable.These are the best training pants for my son.My son is 23~24 lb and the 18 months size has been perfect.These don't shrink - I wash them with my baby's diapers in hot water and they still fit great.Our daughter is 26 lb, 35 in and she fits in the 18 mo size just fine.Her derriere would be described as petite though since she is slender.My son is now 16 months and the mattress is holding up great!Get this mattress for the chemical-free factor, the organic factor, and the customer service!!Even is it didn't come with a cover I would have bought one to protect it and it would likely not be a safe and high quality as the one that already comes with this mattress.And everything inside is certified safe.This one delivers on all counts so what is all the complaining about?Safe now and safe later in case of accidents.This so called perfect mattress does not exist.If there is not a water and dust mite cover I don't consider that safe at all.Babies were drinking out of BPA-plastic bottles for a long time before BPA was deemed unsafe.My baby girl can easily outrun me so I'd rather be safe than sorry.When we first got it, I let my daughter inspect it, then I put him on so she could see how much fun he is.Within a few hours he became part of her buddy pack (may have something to do with the kissy noises I make for him) and she would ask for me to put him on her.We also do our best to teach our daughter to walk WITH us not ahead of us so I don't have to pull her back.We've had this for a few months and it's really come in handy (especially during the holiday season).This harness really helped me keep her safe and I like that I can remove the leash (I think that's what it's called) part so she can play with just the giraffe if she wants to.There really isn't much storage room in the backpack portion of this so if that's what you need from a harness then this probably wouldn't work for you.It's still a work in progress but be prepared to work with your toddler on this one until they are used to it.Possibly use at home first or a simple trip to the park to get them used to it.It has a pocket, which is so small it's pretty much non-functional.This harness did a good job keeping our child at a good distance for some "freedom".Bought the snack traps because it was hard to give my son snacks in the car, as they would end up everywhere - hence the snack trap.The lid is soft on little hands and my 1 yr old loves it.I highly recommend spending the $ for the extra base.You won't regret it.It is so easy to just click it in and know your child is safe.Love it!It's the safest one out there and incredibly easy to install, especially if you have the latch system!I can still use it on my 6 month old and he seem comfortable in it.It says that X-small will fit a woman size 2 and 4.Not true!!!.I felt like my baby couldn't breath.We love this co-sleeper.We've taken it on trips that are more than one overnight.We have The mini (not convertible) for work and the bottom storage gets a lot of use.We switched to cloth which was great, while my son was strictly breastfed.Now we simply line the diaper with these beforehand and - like magic - when our wee one let's go, we just pull that out, flush and we are, typically, 95% done with a poo filled diaper.It's awesome.They make life better.These liners are awesome...These do their intended purpuse, but they are not very soft at all.Use a piece of fleece if you really don't want the poop on your diapers.I just wash them, unless they have more than pee, and I can use them again.These make cloth diapering a lot more user friendly.My son is very active and I have found that these usually end up giving him a wedgy.They are nice when he poops as they catch most of it and make washing a lot easier.My kid usually only poops once a day, so once he's gone, we risk it and go with out.The issue is how rough and uncomfortable these things feel.They are very strong, wide, and long so when my son's poop becomes more "normal", I think they will work better for him.Very easy to install.I ended up moving the fan to an outlet behind some furniture which would wedge it in and prevent this happening.(The cats regularly unplug the stereo by walking past it.)I would definitely buy these again, and wish I'd bought them sooner.They're easier to use than the multiple plastic outlet plugs I was using before.With this outlet cover it just slides to the side when you want to plug something in, and then when you take the item out the protective cover goes back into place.This is a great item for child proofing your house without feeling like the adults want to pull their hair out.Still, I am sure the baby will enjoy them.It has bright colors to stimulate there interest and makes noise which is a big plus with infants.The keys have no sharp edges making it easy to chew on from any angle.Bought it for my 5 month old that's been teething, he loves it!The seat encompasses them somewhat, and with the additional armrests and footrests offers stability and makes them feel like they are securely seated.My 2yr old still needs a booster seat but wants to keep up with her older siblings and isn't interested in using it.Eventually I decided to just give in and make everyone happy.It's wonderful!And the unexpected bonus is that a Bright Starts plastic stepstool fits perfectly between the legs of the Kaboost.Of course that depends on the size of your chairs, but it works out wonderfully for us.She's not tall enough to climb into the chair with Kaboost's elevated height and they recommend not standing on the frame of it.It makes her completely independent and completely happy.In my case however with a 2 year old, the booster elevated the chair too high, so that my son's legs were right up against the bottom of our kitchen table.For what it's worth, our 2 year old son is about average height, and our dining set was from a large furniture manufacturer: and fairly typical of the dining table and chair set the average household may have.We received these clippers as a gift and they have been really wonderful.The handle is comfortable and I feel I have a better grip when clipping my son's nails.I wish they made grown-up nail clippers with this kind of handle.They lose a star because the magnifying glass is useless, the baby has to be perfectly still for it to be of any use.Our baby's nails can become sharp and scratchy.They grow very slowly and become somewhat ragged along the edges.My wife has trimmed them using a standard adult nail clipper, and that worked fairly well.My wife purchased a First Years Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper.He still remembers the Grandpa incident.In any case, the clipper is of an appropriate size and works well and was inexpensive.I typically just file down our son's nails because I'm not comfortable clipping them.I still was not comfortable clipping them with these.The handle is great and easy to grip and the clippers work as they should.However, I would suggest that if you aren't comfortable cutting tiny nails, these aren't going to make it any easier.I ended up accidentally cutting my baby's skin the first time I used them because the magnifier distorted the view and made it much more difficult to see what I was doing.Luckily with these, you can easily move the magnifier out of the way.It's cheap plastic, gets fogged/scratched easily, and doesn't really magnify much.Also, there is no guard on the clippers to prevent cutting skin or the quick.It is not welded in there or attached in any way - it will definitely fall out after use.Finally, we found NO clippers that work for babies younger than 2 months.After 2 months, we used a variety of clippers (different ones for fingers, toes, thumbs, whether she's asleep or moving around, etc).I also use theFirst Years Red Cross Sure-Grip Nail Clippers.They have a guard & are safer to use.Clipper works great and is perfect size for tiny fingernails!This helps make it effective for the front/back and left/right sides of the mouth.- The little spinner on the end always seems to catch my daughters eye.- It is pretty quietOther things to consider- While it is not a "negative" it is impossible to access the batteries.my baby loves it.I tried the Dr. Brown's bottle brush and this one is definitely superior.It's held up better, and I like the fold out nipple brush.That brush lasted maybe 2 months at best.I started using this one and it's still holding up great after 5 months.The sponge at the end of this brush has a much denser form than Munchkin's and held up nicely when cleaning the inner pipes of the Dr. Brown bottles.I started making my own babyfood and I like these storage units for the food I have made.The tops pop on nicely and seem to be secure.I wouldn't throw these into my purse because I don't trust that they wouldn't open up.I purchased these for homemade baby food.The lids stay on perfectly.There is a tray that comes with it which can be written on with dry erase marker to label your foods but I have never used it.Other than that I am pleased with this item.I was using an icecube tray but a little piece broke off the corner so I bought these because I thought it might be a little more reliable since it's actually made for baby food.We have the Kinderville jars that we've used when we defrost and take food on the go and I think I'll fork over the money for the freezer cubes.Plus the cubes pop out of the silicone without dipping in warm water.2 weeks later:Addition to my last review.One corner shattered into a few sharp little pieces.I tried to pick them all up but one little piece had shot across the room and my daughter just found it and almost put it in her mouth.I was going to deal with the last breakage and blamed it on the dishwasher, opting to hand wash instead.Also, I wasn't happy with the price.My baby is new to eating solids.(They say it is microwave safe, but I would rather use glass if I microwave.)I love it!I have some of the same complaints as the other moms.They are leakproof and have an attached lid.Bought this thinking it would make my life easier.I wish I hadnt bought it.This would be an awesome toy for sand though.I first bought these items as bath toys for my infant.It's easy to use and gets the job done.We just open it and let the steam out and let the items cools before touching.The tongs do not grasp items well and we almost dropped several items trying to use them before we threw them out.We bought several packs of these when my girls were old enought to start having tummy time.These are cheaper at Sams Club, thats where we got ours.The color tile part is textured, non-slip and easy to clean.It doesn't absorb moisture which is great.The color side is not as soft as the solid black side but my girls have fallen and banged their heads on it many times when they were first learning to crawl and they never had any problems.If you think its too hard for your baby you can either use the black side or use a blanket.My parents bought some of the foam tiles that have the removable letters in them several years ago, these are WAY better.The letters DO get lost and also wear out easily, plus it is a huge pain in the butt to have to put all the letters back in when you need to have the solid tiles.My best friend has some solid square tiles similar to mine but they feel cheaper and have several gouges in them(bought same time as we bought these), plus the tiles don't seem to fit perfectly together.My tiles connect together perfectly, there are no gaps what so ever!!My best friend & parents both like our mats better and wish they had these instead...these would make a great baby shower gift, especially if someone has bare floors.We've got laminate flooring in our livingroom and put together 6 pieces to place our girls Jumperoos on.I am now exercising daily while watching TV!!They are so convenient, you can either move them as 1 big piece since they are lightweight and stay together well or you can break them down into individual squares easily...although they stay together well, if you want them to come apart, they do so easily too.What a nice investment, you can use these for your baby and then have them for many other uses for years and years.Oh yea, forgot to mention that the dog & cat like these as well.I bought this bottle tote as a last resort because the Dr. Brown's bottles wouldn't fit in any of the other bottle totes that I tried.I purchased the "lotus" and love the colors and the material( black and red).Over all i think it is pretty light compared to others i have tried and owned.It is comfortable to carry and easy to get baby buckled in.I would recomend this to other parents.I love this carseat.It was super easy to install with the latch system and is very, very safe.I have a base in my car and my husband bought an extra base (only about $35) for his car.I highly recommend!Graco is very reliable, and the Snugride is among the best infant carseats out there.We had one for our son back in 2006, but it was probably the last model that came in a 3pt harness.Of course now they don't even sell them with 3pt harnesses anymore, so I wouldn't even consider reusing his old seat.Anyway, we LOVED the Snugride then, and we love it now.Our little one seems quite comfortable in it.There's no disturbing a sleeping baby and it takes seconds to get situated.Very important when you have other children along!The sun shade is not huge, but it's pretty decently sized.It can be moved forward if necessary to keep the sun out of baby's eyes while you are driving/strolling.And honestly, the fact that it's one of the safest models out there is a huge selling point to me!Now, that said, I do have some minor complaints (again, they are so minor that it wouldn't stop me from buying or using the seat!Before that, an inexpensive infant head support pillow really does the trick.3) I wish all the Snugride models came with harness covers/pads.Ours did not come with them, but we found some nice ones for only a few dollars that match the seat and keep our baby comfortable.4) It's a little inconvenient that the harness adjustment is in the back of the seat and you have to adjust each side one at a time, rather than just pressing a button or pulling a small lever in the front to adjust both at the same time.I'm really not sure why they felt this was an "improvement" but it's really not a big deal at all.All that said, we still love this seat and would not use any other brand or model!The Graco travel systems are so much simpler to use than the other brands as well (so I've seen and heard anyway).There will always be "something" you would like to fix, or have a little different, with every baby item you buy, no one item is totally perfect.But in my opinion and experience, the Graco Snugride is as good as you're going to get!My husband has a very bad back, and I'm pretty petite... we chose this carseat because it's light, but sturdy, and it was a great value.We're very happy with it.We love it!We purchased the Colgate Classica mattress due to is recommendation in the Baby Bargains book.we added a mattress pad which makes it a little better, but not much.other than that, happy with it.did not have any defects as mentioned in a couple of other reviews.lightweight which makes changing the sheets very easy.We purchased this changing pad after doing some research on our own.I also purchased aBasic Comfort Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover - Sage, and this cover fits just fine.If you want all of the eco friendly labels and a little bit cuter sheep print then go to BRUS and buy their organic Serta changing pad, but if it's not a huge deal then just save a $ and get this one instead.Our 4.5 month old LOVES this teething ring.We coated it in the recommended beeswax.This doesn't look like much but our baby LOVES it.Perfect!These window shades are awesome and give great coverage.The only caveat I have is that you cannot choose where you want the suction cups to go and  so if you have an odd shaped window (not a perfect rectangle) it will pucker in places.So I was a bit skeptical about getting another shade but decided to try it out.They stick on really well (sometimes you have to restick the corners but it's not a big deal) and have 4 stickies that twist into place and then a few anchor suction cups.We usually would donate items we don't have a use for, however we had very real safety concerns about this item.It could so easily have just flown off the window and hit the baby if there was a crash or a sudden stop.We love this mobile!The characters are cute and the movement is superb!Now that our daughter is 4 1/2 months old she is very facinated with the aspects of the movement.Whenever we pick her up she wants to be held so she can view it at eye level and reach out and touch the mobile.I think it is helped her develop very good hand - eye coordination.The strings do seem too fragile for her to pull on it though.I highly recommend it.I have been very happy with these bottles so far.They also feel sturdy and well-made in your hand.I received this sterilizer as a gift from my registry.Well, the larger (taller) Dr. Brown bottles are too tall for this sterilizer.Therefore, I am going to try a more universal sterilizer, such as the Munchkin or First Years one.Overall, unless you are strictly using BornFree bottles, I would suggest checking out another sterilizer.(Also the other sterilizers I am considering, the First Years and Munchkin ones, are cheaper.They 0-3 isn't really usable once the child ages because it's too hard to suck.And at the same token the late stage bottle flows too freely for a smaller child.It's a fine bottle.My son had some success with it, after failing miserably with the Breastflow system.But it's worth a try if you don't mind spending the extra money.The round valve at the end of the bottle regulates the air inflow and allows milk to flow into the baby's mouth smoothly.This minimizes the chance that baby would gulp in too much unwanted air.Make sure you read all the instructions on how to assemble the bottle to prevent leakage.We have since graduated to the Stage 2 bottles (blue color).We purchased 4 of these bottles and use them daily.They have held up beautifully to the constant use.We like this so much that we have already purchased the Stage 3 (orange color) ones!You can buy warming caps to put over the bottles so that they can be immersed into warm water or into a bottle warmer.Hi,We like this clock.It is super cute and my son really seems to be understanding the whole "bunny asleep" "bunny awake" thing.A few reviews I read makes it sound like this clock will be the solution to any sleep issues.While it is cute, and I feel that after a month or so of using it my son does seem to stay in bed in the a.m. until the bunny "wakes" up, I don't think it is a miracle worker or anything.If you have a kid who isn't staying in bed, chances are the clock isn't going to change that alone.We don't use that, as I am more than pleased if my son sleeps past when the bunny wakes up!It sounds like birds chirping and actually scared my son the night Dad accidentally set it to go off with the alarm in the morning.The clock is lightweight and doesn't feel like much at all, but so far it has worked well for us.No, this is not a $400 changing table from Pottery Barn.So I didn't want to spend too much on something we'll only use for a year.This table fits the bill.This took me about 40 minutes to unpack and assemble and was easy enough to do by myself.It is a bit wobbly, requiring a tightening of the bolts every once in awhile, which helps.My 10-month-old is wiggle city and flips over and sits/stands up on this while we try to change/dress him (lots of fun, let me tell you) and it holds up.My son is 21 lbs.Ditto the matching crib, bite marks and all.Overall I'm not sorry we purchased this although I was on the fence about getting a changing table (so worth it!)One was on the bottom piece and it isn't very noticable and one was on the side rail.It is awesome for the price, n my opinion they could charge more for it and it would be worth it.WE came very, very close to getting into a $800 or higher crib but at the last minute said forget it, lets give the Graco a try.And it looks great too!I love the design extras on it.Nice extras for a crib.This is a beautiful, sturdy, easy to assemble and true white crib.we love it.We love this crib!It's great quality materials and very sturdy.Anyway my husband and I highly recommend this crib and would buy it again if we had to do over again.I got 2 of these to attach to the sides, and I am organized with all the storage I need.Even on my stroller with a decent size basket I love this side saddle bag for items I need to reach quickly like snacks and first-aid and cleansing cloths.I bought this to use on both my Maclaren Quest and my Maclaren Twin Techno.I only used this on my Maclaren Quest.We have a Combi sport side-by-side stroller and I'd hoped this would be a nice spot to stow sippy cups but it's not a good fit for our stroller.If you were a tosser/turner and then you develope a belly and found you were comfortable on one side of your body, you won't know until that baby starts jutting out.If you stay in one position, does your back hurt?I would say my only complaint is that the section for your head is too full, but I fixed this by undoing some stitching and removing a bunch of fluff and now its pretty much perfect.I am a big fan of this pillow.The top is perfect for cuddling and giving support to my growing belly.But it's still worth it!Unfortunately they are HUGE.This is a beautiful crib.The color on the internet is true to the actual color.I love this bed, it is extremely sturdy and met all of our expectations.Also, we really like that this crib came with the toddler rail because with most cribs you have to purchase this piece separately.The crib is gorgeous and very sturdy.The shelf underneath is not of the same quality, but it will stow away a few sheets or blankets nicely.I wont say its great but it does the job.I don't see this crib making it to a full size bed.Its just not sturdy enough for that.It will easily get dents or scratches.We bought this crib before our son was born and he's now 15 months.The side rail that comes with the crib is great!This changing table looks exactly as it does in the picture and has four storage areas underneath - really useful for storing diapers, wipes, etc!The changing table appears to be quite sturdy and the color is gorgeous.Baby hasn't arrived yet, but once he/she does, I will update my review!It was a little too wide for a small hand to comfortably grip, so my daughter dropped it repeatedly, thus defeating the purpose for the harder to clean shape.Jaden LOVES this cup and can use it all by himself at age 1 with NO leaking and he doesn't pull the top off!It does drip a bit if you turn it upside down.Its not actually a leak, its meant to drip...its not a bottle.First off, my daughter loves holding this.You'll probably love it!I like that this is a sippy cup I can take in the diaper bag and if it gets tipped it doesn't leak very much.I noticed that my son (who uses other sippies and can drink from straws well) was not interested in using this cup, so I tried it and found that I had to suck VERY hard to get a tiny bit to come out.Perhaps we have a defective cup?We bought four other brands of sippy cups before ever trying the Boon Fluid.This is BY FAR the best cup we own.This one has a rubber-ish piece in the top that has a slit in it.I, like others, bought this sippy cup because I thought it had a really neat design.That is about as far as the positives go.The first time we traveled with our son, we took these.I make homemade baby food, and unfortunately, the Boon Spoon does not work well with homemade food.If you make your own food, you know that it's impossible to get the purees completely lump-free (I tried one spoon filled with banana puree, and one with sweet potato puree).I had to keep shaking the food back down to unclog it and squirt more food out with the lumps out of the way.The next three times I traveled with my son, I just decided to bring along store-bought food and had no problems with dispensing (my son just doesn't care for the taste of store-bought food very much).It really is a great product - awesome for traveling, works well, easy to clean, does not leak, and holds a decent amount of food (though having two is better than one).Also, it eliminates all the frustration my hungry baby feels when he has to wait for me to get another spoonful.Second, the flip lid doesn't always stay closed, so if it's rolling around in your bag, it opens somewhat easy and spills items.My 2.5 year-old has been using this set for just over a year.I am much more satisfied (though also bummed at the cost of) the oxo set.We purchased the Blue and White version.The color was a tiny bit darker than the picture shown in the preview.It's very nice looking.Both the spoon and fork are soft and bendable.The grip is not too large for our son (1 year 1 month), and fit around his hand perfectly.Never using any type of utensils to feed himself before, he was able to grab the spoon and swung it around a bit.After a day of "practice" and guiding his hand on what he should be doing, he was able to push the food around.With additional practice, I can see him feeding himself with the spoon, and us not having to worry about him poking his eyes out.The fork tips aren't sharp, so it's very hard to use it to poke food.I don't see him using the fork for anything but scooping food.So, we'll probably skip the fork all together, and just stick with the spoon.As a practice tool, I think it was worth every penny.I bought this for my infant son when he got his first cold.The quiet setting is anything but.You either have to wash the filter every few days or replace the filter every week or so.This is the third winter I'll be using this humidifier in my sons room.It works great.You do have to make sure you get the cap on tight or the water will leak but that only makes sense and it's not difficult to get it on tight.I've never seen a spec of mold on it or the filter - ever.I do change the filter about once a month because of lime scale.I notice a huge difference in my son's skin when we use this humidifier.It does it's job and it's easy to use and clean.This swing has a ton of features and offers a lot of entertainment.With multiple music and sounds effect settings, it goes above and beyond with an additional tray for you to plug in your iPod.This swing will do the trick.I love that it has vibration.I love the cozy head rest area.a great feature-I love the directions it swings-5 point harness!Not something you want to even move from the living room to the kitchen.i'll reattach it when i give it away.Since I can't resell something that doesn't play music.when she was first born she loved the side to side but now she is 4 months old and she likes it back and forth.but it was worth that little hassle.Also the vibration on the seat is great.I don't know that we would have gotten through the first year without this.Fantastic, versatile, and worth every penny.This swing has not been a hit with our son.At no stage has he found this a place of comfort.We bought this swing over others for the interchanging of the seats.I used this chair for close to a year and once my son started nearing 20 pounds the swing struggled to keep moving under his weight (my son was in a larger percentile for height and weight so we hit the 20 pound mark at 10 months old.)This was recommended to me by one of our friends who had a colicky baby.I loved the features, it swings side-to-side and back-to-front.but i've read some reviews and descriptions that say its very quiet....its NOT!.I dont have any major complaints and i can deal with the sound, but take note.all in all...its seems good.The size of the water holder is probably its best feature.We took this with us on our trip to Europe with my 11 month old.Very easily adjustable.Looks like good quality so far (i used it three times daily for a week).It folded up very easily and compactly (2x3x4").Our daughter has been very strong since day one so we got this for her before she was even 4 months old.She absolutely loves it!We have it on a standard size door frame and it's worked out well...no scuff marks anywhere and easy to move.Very sturdy and nicely built.If it is too short, just use some extension ribbon.It is very flexible and covers a wide range of doors frames and kid sizes.If you are on the extreme sizes and happen to bought it, just take 5 min...The one we had before last through 7 kids (until my son took some sissors to it) besides what happened to it, it was still is perfect condition and we are rough with our toys.Great bouncer!My 7 mo daughter loves this!It took her about a month before she actually started bouncing up and down in it, but once she started she doesn't quit.She is full of smiles and super happy in it.It is very sturdy and safe.Highly recommend!As soon as we put our baby in the jumper, we was entranced.But with the jumper, he absolutely loves it!It's absolutely great and I strongly recommend.Info: Our son is 3 months old and 16.5 lbs.My daughter loves jumping in this--it is her favorite!Bouncebouncebounce, for 5 to 20 minutes at a time depending on her mood.Observers wondered if she would fall out.=) Anyway, he was a little small for it so we have to pack him in the seat.If your child is way above the norm in height, you might want to try someone else's first just to be sure.My 7 month old loves this.My baby chews and sucks on everything.I did wash the sun with a towel and a bit of soapy water, and the red color stained the entire thing.This does keep my baby entertained longer than any of her other toys, and I know she is safe (contained) if I need to wash dishes or take a quick shower.I can move her to any room in the house and keep her occupied  for a little while.I also had high hopes for the bilingual nature and the stimulating toys.My dismay started with the instruction manual (which lacked words) and ended with the exceedingly dull "activities" and the few hard to understand sounds.Few toys make noise or move and our baby likes the best her toys that are stimulating on multiple levels.This toy was certainly not the stimulating and engaging activity center I had hoped for.I suggest this may work for a more sedentary or inactive baby but my very active girl likes to bounce and she kept trying to bounce  in this and got nowhere.Nor was she able to move the seat in a circle.She loves it!I bought this before my daughter was born and it sat in storage until she was 3 months.She was able to see the world from a whole new perspective.Highly recommended from a skeptical Mommy.My daughter loves this!We started using it around 4 months (when her back and neck got nice and strong) and now at six months she still loves it and uses it every day.She plays happily in it while I am getting ready in the morning and when I am working in the kitchen in the evening.This one is really great.This activity center is GREAT.I was a little concerned my little one would be too small and not ready for this.However, since he can hold his head up, I thought I may give it a try.I love this monitor.So then we got a second one.Probably not important, I know, but both my husband and I appreciate that.I'm sure there's better monitors out there.My toddler son go a hold of one of the base units and messed up the wire.Also ours will NOT turn off sometimes even when we press the button.I LOVE IT -- the perfect combination of lightweight + recliningit is light -- easy to fold and open -- the one hand open and close option works very well (after you 'figure it out').very durable -- we have taken it on 5-6 trips -- it has been (man)-handled by the baggage handlers at many different airports (in the US and in a few South American countries)the reclining is more than enough to get my baby to sleep comfortably --- the hood is a little small (especially when the seat is reclined), so we used a jacket or blanked to provide additional shade while she was sleeping.it is easy to maneuver in small spaces and on all sorts of surfacesfits easily in a regular sedan trunkThe ride isn't smooth at all and it's rickity.I've seen it on sale for about $100, but it's not worth it at all.First, I love a lot about this seat.It is made of wonderful material that is breathable and every single piece of it comes apart so that you can wash it, which is a huge plus when you have a little one with reflux.I am not a super strong woman, and I would think that me pulling in either direction on the latch should not be enough force to separate it.She is noticeably uncomfortable whenever she is in it, it is ridiculously heavy (My wife never carries it) and the straps always always twist.It has become a hassle taking our daughter out, we have to wait for her to be sleepy so we can strap her in.For the almost $300 I paid for this, I really think it was a let down.We are looking at convertible seats on amazon today.The straps ALWAYS tangle twist and get stuck, ALWAYS!!Here's a quick comparison:The peg perego compared to the graco, looks MUCH safer, more solid, and even more comfortable.I agree with the other reviewer who got the cocoa/natural combination that for whatever reasons, the natural is slightly softer than the cocoa (the dye perhaps?)but it's still soft and we're happy with it.I would have given it 5 stars, except we have fabulous Lands End flannel sheets on our bed so I know that better flannel exists out there at a reasonable price, my only lament is that Lands End doesn't make flannel crib sheets!He seems to be very comfy and warm in his crib with the flannel sheets.They did however shrink a noticeable amount making them an extra snug fit on the mattress.Thicker and softer than the standard receiving blankets out there.My only complaint is that the edges tend to wrinkle in the wash, and I am not really up for ironing baby blankets.I was looking for something to hold cubes of fresh fruits for my (still toothless) infant and these are perfect!The mesh is just large enough for baby to gnaw/gum/mash the fruits and enjoy the sweetness without having to worry about chunks that might choke.It seems to also work as a teether too and we love it!He loves the shapes and colors and the pieces are soft so when he does fall over it's not so painful.I highly recommend these although you need at least 2 packs.A place for baby to stay in the kitchen while I cook.She likes to eat the pieces, however - so it's great that they are not too small to pose a hazard.I still keep an eye on her.It's also movable, so we take it between the basement and the living room when needed.Also, she likes the colors (she started at 8 months old).It was about half the size of her other cuddler blanket.The only part that has stuffing is the head.I do think it is made from probably the nicest, softest courduroy Ive ever seen, and the burlap medallion on the chest gives an interesting texture to touch and chew on, but other than that I'm not sure it provides that comfort we hoped it would.I like the different textures on it.This is a great walker.. my son loves it!LOVE IT!I like that the music/activity part of it can be popped out and be used as a tray if I want to give her some finger foods.Just a side note: the parts of the walker that look red on the photos are really a pink/fuchsia color.The red is actually hot pink, I love it!!!!I am very happy with it.I love the larger size of these bottles.It surprised me how flexible the plastic was on these bottles compared to the bottles that I used for my first son, but they are still durable.My 8 oz bottles came with medium flow nipples which were a bit to fast for my 4 month old but we just bought some slow flow nipples to switch out and it works wonderfully.These bottles are wider than I expected.I have not used it yet since my son is still using the 5 oz.I figures I would use the bottles as my son gets older and eats more.The nipples that come with these bottles are medium flow which is too fast for my son at this point so I have to also purchase the slow flow nipples.I wish Amazon sold just the collarsIt's the perfect size, and is very easy to attach to the chair.My son is almost 4 and uses this without the tray so he can slide right up to the table.Second, the back rest folds down for ease of transport, but the joint is not all that solid when the back rest is raised, so when my daughter leans back it rocks back and forth.I wish there were a way to permanently lock it down for those who do not intend to travel with this seat.Overall, it's great for the price and easily transitions to a 'big-kid' booster, making it a smart long-term purchase.Recommended.I love this seat so much I have two!It folds and you can use the chair strap as a carrying strap which makes it super easy to bring with you.I keep one at my ILs and one at home to bring it wherever we are going.My daughter likes to have her own space to eat, so having this chair gives her that freedom (vs. someone holding her while she tries to eat).It easily wipes down and like I said, since it folds, it is easy to store when not in use.And unlike other boosters, she can lean back on it.The only disadvantage I saw so far is the colors: I wish there was some more choice.Though my daughter LOVES her orange and yellow sit.I am really happy and I only wish I had bought this when she was younger!I have small space and couldn't find an inexpensive high chair that worked in my decor of warm tones.To my surprise, the safety straps fit perfectly around the underside and back of my equipale dining chair and pulled everything together while accommodating the safely baby at the table.Tray is dishwasher safe.The quality of this chair is good, no complaints.Before that it was uncomfortable, his head was bend forward in a weird way.We are definitely using it now, but i wish i would have gotten a bouncy that was more infant friendly so i could have used it longer..We have had this bouncer for nearly 6 months and it has held up well.Portable & lightweight (easy to take from room to room)4.I like that it does not play music!But it is not nearly as entertaining as the star stacker (above).My son (5 months) much prefers the lights and music.Coir is incredibly strong, especially when treated as was the coir that went into this mattress.This mattress is GREAT!I had originally bought a regular crib mattress from BabiesRus.It seemed really good for the price - firm, but not too uncomfortable for baby.Many chemicals are put into these mattresses, including roach killer, arsenic and antimony, and solid petroleum.But as with food and dairy industries, organic does not always mean so.The mattress provides ventilation and maintains temperatures to stay warm or cool, depending on the needs.The mattress fits perfectly in my Pali Paula crib (even better than the first mattress I purchased, since that one was a little short on the sides).This will be GREAT for use as a toddler mattress, since it will still be comfortable for a younger child.My baby picks it up (I don't say pull cause it's barely attached) and mouths it or throws it around.The mirrow warped when pulling off the protective cover.She only likes to use it at certain times of the day.I was really disappointed with the lights on the arch not working.Only one lights up.We just bought this for our 4 1/2 month old son.When we put Caleb in it for the first time he didn't seem to happy and the lowest setting was a little tall for him still (he is 25 in long) so we would put a thin pillow or blanket underneath him to help out and he would go to town jumping away.Luckily, the overhead light bar is enough to keep him occupied for a good period of time.He hasn't quite figured out the flipping of the pages of the book yet, but I am sure he will get there.Lastly, I really like that you can set the music to come on only when they bounce or constantly no matter what.Overall, I recommed this jumperoo to all parents out there, and if you don't like this one, get another one because it is truley a lifesaver when you need a freehand for a few minutes and sometimes for 30 mins or more.This chair is perfect for on the go trips, especially trips to Grandma's.Works great, toys are a nice feature.It can be used on most full-sized dining chairs and can be left in place, if necessary, so that storage does not become an problem.This is an excellent item for individuals who need to have a highchair handy for grandchildren or visitors, but who do not want a full-sized highchair taking up valuable living space.Individuals living in apartments or smaller homes, and who have a small to average sized infant may find it useful as a space saver.Those who frequently visit friends and want to have a highchair available for feeding will find this very portable and easy to attach and detach from a regularly sized dining room or kitchen chair.The drawbacks associated with the booster seat are several.This booster seat is light, easy to install (two clips with adjustable straps), and easy to clean.Now that my son is older (18 months) we use it as a booster seat and I still have no complaints.I got this when my daughter started having solids at 6 months old and she still uses it at 2 1/2 years.I did have to pad the chair with blankets when she was 6 months old to keep her from slumping.At 2 1/2, she is 29 lbs and 34 inches and sits comfortably in it.It is definitely not small as one reviewer mentioned.It is very well made and has been with us on many trips, both domestic and international.Purchased these for our living room furniture as well as a pack of the Safety 1st brand from Hardware Store.For kitchen cabinets they are good I am sure but not so great for other applications.These locks are easy to install.I used the screws in addition to the tape because the tape did not seem to secure.These outlet covers are perfect.They are very nice looking, and there are no small parts (like the plug in covers) to be lost or present a choking hazard.They don't even look like a baby-proofing item until you get close to them.They made our old brown outlets look much better.The spring is strong but not excessively so.They work well for plugs that you still need to be able to use but I would recommend going with something a bit more permanent or plastic outlet plugs for other outlets (maybe even a combination of these plus plastic plugs).His fascination with everything dangerous made us act quickly and these made it so easy.They were super easy to install, they look nice and clean (better than the old ones that were in!)and are so easy to use.He has not even tried to figure these out, even though he looks at and touches outlets often.Once the plug is pulled from the outlet, the cover slides itself back in place to cover the outlet.FANTASTIC!I am updating this a after many months of use and we have absolutely LOVED these.They all are holding up very well.It is a great, safe, sturdy product.They also look great, much better than plugs and other options.We have actually gotten compliments many times because of them.When we have other kids visiting (up to 4 years old!Engages a young mind with its puzzle pieces.Works as a seat and tabletop.It's fun to look at, too.My baby loves these and it was on of the first toys he was able to grip.For nature loving, eco-friendly mamas like me this is a perfect, chemical free (for the most part) addition to your son or daughter's toy collection!It was smaller than I thought which is a good thing and has a very easy to grip trunk to hold on to.I haven't yet had a child shake it and hit themselves in the head with the leaves, but I would say that would be a definite possibility as the leaves are very large (almost the size of the trunk) and could hurt if a child were to hit themselves with it, but then again most toys would when shaken).Great toy overall, would buy again.There are a lot of places to suck on or chew, and it is very cute and sends a great message early on!Fabric felt sturdy enough, seams and zipper seem sturdy.2.ANY bump by the other luggage sent this tipping over sideways, into people.5.However, better than just carrying it, and benefit of extra storage space makes this "JUST OK".Because this damage occurred during travel the airline and manufacturer denied responsibility.Sturdy construction and easy to put the seat in and take it out.My only suggestion is for the company to make a better handle -- this one is just a strap attached to the top -- and I think a pull up handle would be perfect.It survived both trips intact, no broken wheels or any problems.I also put our jackets inside since we flew from a cold climate to a warm one.My husband tried to pull it at the airport, but it just drug behind him.He complained it wouldn't work because he was too tall (6'3").I adjusted the strap and then he could pull it just fine.I felt so sorry for them.It survived the trip on Allegiant Airlines back and forth.Update:  We have had this almost two years now and it has totally held up through about 8 round trip flights and is still as good as new.We now use it with a Britax Frontier Booster and it works even better.I bought this for my nephew.He's about 2.5 years old and on the top of the growth chart.Well not for me, for my son.M&lt;ost likely it will alst through a couple of kids better than this one.If looks or having something your friends don't have is more important, this will be fine.I have a system now, and he is used to it.The mesh material seemed as if would would allow for good air circulation, and I felt it would be comfortable for the baby and for the person carrying the child.Since my daughter was able to work from home, this seemed to be an ideal way for her to keep her baby close while allowing him to have a good view of his world.Additionally, it seemed the outward facing position would help keep him from grabbing her lips or the telephone during teleconferences.As the Synergy is one of the few carriers on the market that allows the baby to face outward, while being carried on the adult's front side, it seemed to be a fine choice.Unfortunately, we found that for all its positive features, the Synergy was not everything we expected it to be.Further, our grandson was and is a large child - so using the Baby Bjorn Synergy for more than 30 minutes is out of the question - anyone who did so, even those with healthy backs, had significant back discomfort.This is quite disappointing as he is interested in seeing the world and loved riding on our front when any of us carried him that way.Perhaps if we all had healthy backs and a lighter child to carry, the Baby Bjorn Synergy would have received a higher rating.However, the expense of this item is greater than its utility and I cannot give it a higher rating.very comfortable, my baby sleeps in it!It does not hurt my back.Breathable material is perfect, especially for summer.My husband and I both love it!I LIVE IN SOUTH FLORIDA AND IT'S VERY HOT SO THE THE LIGHT, BREATHABLE FABRIC AND WHITE COLOR IS GREAT NOT TO MENTION HOW SECURE AND COMFORTABLE THIS IS FOR BABY AND YOU!This is secure and safe and the extra back support is well worth the extra money!!!!Really, when my baby outgrows this I think I will be in mourning :(  I really love having my buddy right there with me and he loves to explore everywhere I take him.Worth every penny!!!!!Most importantly, our baby loves it.We feel it's worth it.It is lightweight and not bulky which is nice.The other great feature, it is really easy to get on and off and take the baby in and out.Great purchase!She LOVES being in the Bjorn, and the head support for her as a newborn is excellent.Once we figured this out, I was able to comfortably wear the carrier.Another nice feature is the fabric, which is an open mesh weave.We live in Central Texas, and the heat here in the summer is oppressive, and the winters don't really get cold, and the mesh fabric allows for us and our daughter to be as comfortable as possible when we're outside.In fact, we were almost ready to purchase theBaby Bjorn Baby Air Carrier, Grey/Whitebecause of the open weave, but then we discovered that the Synergy is made from the same material, but also includes the lumbar support feature, which was very important to us.So even though the carrier is a bit pricey, it has been worth every penny for us.Perhaps it will get better with practice.He does not like it yet so I don't get much practice.I bought this travel crib after reading all the positive reviews here on amazon.There were other, cheaper options, and our budget was tight, but I didn't want to regret my purchase so I went with this one.We use it all the time -- it's both a travel crib and a safe playpen for our baby, now 16 months.And it's so lightweight and easy to travel with.We used to have a pack n play.Once we bought this item, pack n play went to a friend's house.This travel crib is so much better.I think if I have second child, I may not even bother with a bassinet and just use this crib to have our future newborn in it.It's easy, compact, sturdy, comfortable.Other than being pricy, there is really no cons to it.This is by far the best travel crib on the market - i have used Graco and others - but for "travel" this is the best - super lightweight - sets up in seconds - has a nice cushioned mattress which our daughter seems to like much more than the hard bottomed ones of other models 9but not too soft you would worry with an infant).I swear to you - you will not regret the expense.And I also feel very confident saying this is more comfortable for the baby.We purchased this travel crib when our son was about 8 months old and he is now nearly 2 and we continue to use it.We enjoy the mesh screen which allows us to peek in at him from our bed without getting up.The top rails of the crib form a much smaller rectangle than that of the mattress.We've owned it for over a year and have taken it all over the place.The travel crib packs and unpacks easily and fits in a suitcase-like container.The bottom is larger than the top so the interior space is designed to slope inward and have a wide base so the baby cannot tip it over.We appreciate this feature.My wife thinks it's quite stylish and I'd regard it as very practical.Ours is the dark-blue model with a black container, but the color really makes no difference.It's a rather expensive accessary but has proven to be one of those items that are worth it.it's a lot to spend on a travel crib, but so worth the price.I was really disappointed upon receiving this at the size of the travel crib when packed away.I was hoping for something we could take on an airplane with us as a carry on, this is not the solution that allows for that.We ended up with the GuavaFamily GoCrib and it's fantastic!I really liked it, but unfortunately, my 8.5 month old son did not.My baby hasn't arrived yet, but I can already tell this will be an indispensable item to us.It really is lightweight and is so amazingly easy to set-up and take-down.This is a great price for it, too.It works just as I would expect and the turbo button helps with the harder foods or the ones with thick skin.It is very easy and simple to wash as well.It takes longer to cook the food than to blend it (which is a GREAT thing).I have not used the trays yet because I bought silicone ones and have been using those first.******WARNING/ADVICE****make sure you line the tabs on the lid to the bowl carefully.Love this.The size is very nice, it will make you enough to fill a tray or so of baby food.For larger batches or super chunky food like potatos, I still prefer my Vitamix, but sometimes you don't want to mess with a big blender, you just want to chop and blend a few pears or strawberries or whatever it is, and this will do the job nicely, quickly, and with minimal clean up.Makes it easier to make baby food, so I highly recommend this item.Oh, the trays are nice too.These trays hold about twice the amount of normal ice cube tray hole, which is especially useful for older babies, or to fill with baby's favorite foods.Also, I should note that I always microwave and soften my fruit and veggies first, per the Fresh Baby book, so that may contribute to the nice smooth results I get, the food has already been softened.This mill really makes great baby food.we use it at least once a day and does a great job of blending any type of food and turns it into a really smooth puree.I love it and highly recommend it!It's very sturdy.My one complaint -- the stroller fits in very tightly.You have to struggle a bit to get it in.But for family travel, it's great.Very easy to push and maneuver.My son is almost 21 months old.I think this is a fantastic brand.The strollers are well built, very well priced, come on great colors, they show good thinking in much of the design like the huge sun visors and the reflective tape all over the stroller for traffic safety.Rather than having one hamper in the closet, my grandson now has one in the closet, one in the bathroom, and two his bedroom.Their light weight makes it easy to carry the whole basket up and down stairs when doing laundry.I thought the largest one would be the size of a regular Bongo Bucket.We are very pleased.I have a very smooth tile in this particular bathroom and made sure the cups were suctioned to a flat, cleaned surface.It's cheap enough that it's not the end of the world but it would be nice if it worked well as it is plenty big and easy to use.The pads were a bit smaller than I was expecting them to be, however they work great!I use them to protect my changing tables.These came in handy many times whenever I didn't want something to get soaked with spit-up or risk being peed on.They also wash really easily.I bought this item for many of the same reasons as most other reviewers: because I needed a solution to conveniently tote around 2 kids.It does the job, but not quite as conveniently as I had hoped.Pros:The construction is sturdy.This stroller can take a beating.Also, each seat is independent, meaning that you can recline one while the other sits upright if you want.Cons:This stroller is not as small as I hoped.That's why I have tons of other gear to use instead.I purchased these at Target for our son and he loves them!The balls are perfect for him to grip and it's pretty funny to watch him in his carseat- he drops them and rolls them under his feet against the seat back.Worth every penny.They are soft, but have an interesting texture.My one year old son loves these balls.He chews on them, throws them around, bounces them, and anything else you can think.He was to the point of tears at the end of class when he had to leave them behind.These are about the size of an orange.I just wish they had them in the smaller size.My son LOVES balls.I originally thought these were way too much like the toys we buy for our dog at about $2.99 each but my son LOVES them.Although it means a lot of picking them up, the amount of joy it brings him makes it totally worth it.My son really enjoys these balls.His favorite color is blue.She does not like the ball rolled on her skin (as the box suggests for a massage tool).The spikes, and the sensory part of these are spikes and not smooth bumps, offers a texture that keeps kids interested.We'd had these balls for my son for a very long time, over a year (he's now 20 months), and they are wonderful in so many ways.First, the color selection is perfect.Here you have an easy teaching tool to use with your child starting at a very young age.Lastly, unlike most of my son's other toys, these balls have been steadily used since they were purchased, and I expect their appeal to continue to be strong for some time to come.Every day now, my son is picking up these balls and throwing them back and forth with us.He always smiles and laughs when he does so, and that's a beautiful thing to see.I highly recommend these for anyone with a baby.You'll get a ton of use out of them.My son loves this toy.Great toy for those kids just learning how to grip things.I bought a gate from Evenflo and it just did not work.So of course off to Amazon i go and I purchased this gate from Summer.I got it yesterday and installed it easily.It fit my doorway perfectly with just one extension.I definitely would recommend this gate to anyone looking for a baby gate, and it fits nicely with our home decor.I was looking for something light, easy to fold up, and good looking.I seems easy enough, although you do have to lock the front wheel for it to work best.I think I'd have to use another kind of stroller to see what type of fold I like better.There is also no parent cupholder on this stroller.You can always buy an attachable one.We don't use a stroller too heavily- just for daily neighborhood walks and the occasional outing- and for these purposes this stroller works just fine.It doesn't have the best storage basket, so if you plan on loading up while using the stroller, this might not be the choice for you.If you want a simple, lightweight, nice looking, affordable stroller, I would recommend this one.Lightweight and durable material makes for an excellent combo.We also have the infant seat and use them together in a system.Good:-shoulder strap is surprisingly useful-folds compactly-easy to unfold-washable fabric-sunshade is good size-smooth ride, turns easilyBad:-I hate HATE the way it works with the infant seat.This is a wonderful, very lightweight, stroller.Yes, the shade is small and definitely does not provide much cover, but that's what a hat and blanket are for.The infant foot boot is a nice safety feature as our 5 month old could potentially squirm his way out.What happended to the adult organizer that used to come with it???We put this stroller through the works over the last year and a half and its still holding up.Its great for traveling as it compacts to nothing and is light.The only complaint are the wheels the rubber tends not to roll over pavement that is pitted.Over good surfaces the stroller glides effortlessly.This nice stroller fits in my backseat of my small honda and my husband's mazda (trunk and or backseat).It seems like we don't even have it with us when we travel.It is super lightweight.It has great wonderful wheels that move freely.Also all the wheels lock into place.It survived the trip to and from!I love the arm strap on it to carry around which that is not heard of.Also it can go into the washer and dryer.Most strollers have huge brakes that catch on stairs.The Combi Flare brakes will catch on stairs with a large lip on them like unfortunately the subway stairs, but otherwise work great on our own front stairs which has already made my days 10 times easier.I can fold it small and carry it easily for the subway so I've dealt with that okay.It also surprisingly does just fine on very bumpy, historic bluestone sidewalks and pushing over the grass in the park, all of which I worried about when buying a lightweight umbrella stroller.My son is 18 months old, average percentile in weight like around 60th percentile, and tall, 99th percentile in length and he fits this stroller great.He's very comfortable.My husband and I are both tall and the height of the handlebars is higher than Maclarens or most strollers so we're very comfortable pushing it.The sun canopy is typically tiny and there is no window in it.It wouldn't keep me from recommending this stroller but if Combi made the wheels bigger so it could take the subway stairs better and if the visor were bigger and with a window it would be the perfect city stroller.This stroller looks nice and classy but sucks.We traveled with it several times on a plane and in a car, works great.We started to use it when our daughter was 9 months old and she seemed to really feel comfortable (the baby sits low, forward and in front compared to a full sized stroller).She is now 33" tall in case that helps any of the parents with tall infants/toddlers.Also, after much use, the rubber bar is a bit bent from her pulling on it a lot.These are so simple.Just make sure to put a pad between sheet and mattress cover so you can wash that if baby has an accident.It was such a pain changing my son's crib sheet until I got these!Easy to use.It's wonderful if you have the bumperpads on the crib.A definate A+ in my book!However, that said, the sheets have maintained their size (no shrinkage) and (I don't have the flannel kind) they have also maintained their softness.Doesn't leak as much as other cups I have used.My big complaint is that my son is able to pull/bite bits of the plastic straw off.You really have to supervise all toddlers while they are drinking, but my son has made a game out of trying to pull off the straw which is somewhat disturbing.I will continue using this cup because it keeps in the fluid really well, but only under CLOSE supervision :/My son was stubbornly against holding his own bottle or cup and after trying numerous other sippy cups I decided to try this cup because he wouldn't have to tip it up to be able to drink out of it.The only complaints I have about this cup are that it does leak out quite a bit if it tips over or is shaken and that it needs to be kept somewhat full to keep the straw in the liquid.It's a great cup though and my son loves the soft straw on it, perfect for a teething toddler.He drinks a ton of water from this cup, and loves the straw.i love nuby straw cups, both this one and the non-handled one.submerging the cup and lid into hot water will loosen particles of food that get trapped.my one concern, when your child is teething.and cleaning them doesn't really take any more time than other cups i've tried.The flip top is nice when we go out and bring it with us, I have not had any problems with leaking.I think they are great and have taught our lil gal to not tip her head back too far while drinking, she is starting to practice with a real cup and is doing really well.I wish we could pick the color when ordering, but that is just me :)Other than that its a great cup.My toddler sucks, chews and drools on the straw bit, and I would like to take the flip top / straw part apart to wash it.YUCKI have washed it in the dishwasher, and when it came out tiny food bits (the size of sand) had gotten lodged between the outside of the cup and the second layer of colored palstic.YUCKI also bought the Munchkin flip straw cup.I bought these to have some BPA free bottles for my infant.I received the large Dr. Brown's gift set for my baby shower.I like that I'm able to mix and match them with my other Dr. Browns nipples, caps, air flow straws.Dr. Brown's glass bottle solves the plastic bottle problem but introduce another with the off-gassing vent assembly insert that yields the "natural flow."When the bottles arrived I was happy with the glass bottle, but the chemical smell was overwhelming.(Remember from chemistry, diffusion is the process of things moving from high concentrations to low concentrations.)Concerned, my husband called the Dr. Brown's company and spoke to the director of operations, a chemical engineer.I recommend this seat to any mother who asks.I've recommended it on Facebook, and now I'm recommending it to YOU.I bought this carseat because of it's safety features and the cool no-rethread harness.I recommend this seat because of its safety, its comfort, and its awesome company.My daughter loves her seat.It is comfortable to sleep in, comfortable to ride in, was comfortable rear-facing without the headrest and then with the headrest, has enough height she can see out the window, has enough padding that she doesn't get numb-bum, etc.It's a great seat for a kid.I love this seat because it's safe.Because I can easily adjust the seat size.They were awesome.My husband hit a deer, and because the seats had been unoccupied, the insurance company said they were still safe.They even shipped the old one back to their company for testing.The other carseat I had in the car for my infant son was from another company, and they just told me where I could purchase a new one.This is just a great seat.I am looking into buying another one for my infant son, as he is rapidly outgrowing his infant carrier/carseat.You will love it.I got this seat in 2008 when my son was getting too heavy for me to carry around his infant seat.Install was great, the no re-thread harness adjustment was very nice, I like that it came with harness strap covers (after market strap covers are a no-no) and my boy seemed very comfortable in this seat.The shell is VERY tall when the headrest is on, but it still fit rear facing in my Saturn Ion.The tall shell makes this seat ideal for taller kids.My son was getting close to the rear facing weight limit, but still had 5 inches of shell above his head.I had this seat until recently when my son turned 2.I wanted to keep my tall (37") son in a convertable vs. harnessed booster (like the nautilus) so i came across the true fit- SO great!My son actually looks small in this seat (which is rare for him to look small in anything!)and will last for many years to come.The seat is soo roomy and wide but surprisingly the seat itself is not!VERY plush soft high quality fabric which is important to me and on the black/gray one the gray is this slick fabric that will keep my son cooler in the summer (as opposed to the black part which is a soft velor).Installed very quickly front facing in my jeep grand cherokee and fits great.It is a solid cupholder unlike those on the eveflos that pop open.Great seat for the price, seems even nicer than the britax's i checked out.I love the soft fabric and neutral colors [of the "compass" grey and the pink floral patterns].The easy shoulder belt height adjustment is awesome too!We tried several car seats, and did hours of research, including calls to the National Highway Safety and our state senate.I'm resisting the urge to do a detailed comparison of car seats - they each have pros & cons, including this one.Our primary concern was the safest seat - all other concerns (ease of installation, price, etc) are secondary.We read 3 books looking for car seat recommendations, including consumer reports, and NONE of them talk about this.It's because a few recent laws, passed by politicians who receive campaign contributions from Graco and other car seat manufacturers of cheap Chinese imports (passed in several states so far, and counting).The new so-called child safety laws say (among other things) that you can only buy recently manufactured car seats, and all seats have expiration dates (5 years from manufacture date).This is the only seat we saw that had sturdy plastic, metal pins and components, and a solid frame.A better law would be, to have State Troopers inspect car seats for safety & proper installation.(Thank God for the big corporations, so-called "free trade" with China, and the conservative politicians willing to take their money).So obviously I'm outraged at how these huge corporations are bribing politicians, importing cheap Chinese crap, and call it "child safety".If you can't find the color you want on Amazon, just about any major retailer can order it for you.But very few retailers carry it in stock - we bought ours on Amazon.Please note: If you want the 5-star rated seat, make sure it's the "True Fit Convertible" model by First Years.I bought this when my son was nearing 22lbs at 1 year old and growing out of his infant seat.Also, I loved that I could take off ALL padding and wash EVERYTHING on it without needing to re-thread any straps etc.Easy to install using latch or seatbelt2.My son was very comfortable in itRear facing Cons:1.HAD to be put in middle seat because it's reclined position takes up a lot of space and still touched our front seats in an Acura MDX SUV.Very comfortable for my son3.Easy to install with latch systemForward Facing Cons:1.Everything is easy to adjust.It is very sturdy, but it is also very large and heavy at 24lbs.We have baby #2 on the way, so I'm concerned that this seat and the infant seat are not going to fit side by side in our vehicles.Also, I would not recommend traveling with it.We had to strap it to a portable dolly to get it through the airport because there was no way we could carry it around.Just buckling it normal works fine.Again, it is very big and wide.It would not fit rear-facing in an airline seat and really takes up the whole seat when it's forward facing.Ultimately, if you don't plan on traveling with it, will only install forward facing, and don't intend to move it from one car to another, this is a great, stable, safe and comfortable seat for your child.We had received a Safety 1st convertible seat at our shower (we didn't register for it) and have been using that in our main vehicle.Our son is a little on the lean side, so the extra padding makes it a more secure fit for him.The plushness of this seat makes me want to ride in it.I would buy this again in a heartbeat.We have this carseat rear facing in the back of a Subaru Impreza WRX hatchback, and we are able to comfortably have it in the middle, not have to shove up the front seat, and if need be can still squeze two adults on either side.The seat is very squishy and comfortable, and is highly rated by Consumer Reports and other sites for crash safety.However, we don't plan on removing the seat often, and you don't have to change straps often.Otherwise, this is a very safe and well made car seat and our 17-month old has found it very comfortable and secure for the past 8 months.It took me a while to find the perfect car seat for both my daughter and me.Great seat, we would highly recommend!I love love love this carseat!It is my favorite one outta 5.It seems very comfortable.It is very easy to wash, and I love how it clips onto the carseat!I love the color and wow does it feel soft!One more thing to hand wash!Almost perfect!I received this from my cousin-in-law (more like a sis-in-law, haha) and the toy captures the attention of my now 3 month old crazy good.I like to move it up down and around to have my baby's eyes follow the lights and sound, and I'm pretty sure this is a great way to help with eye development.Downside, like previously mentioned by others, is that the songs are short and there is no continuous loop option.But that's it!LOVE IT!For under $10, you get fascinating moving lights, a colorful caterpillar handle that is easy to grasp, and best of all an impressive variety of classical tunes that last for a LONG time!Highly portable..a great take-along toy.Much loved!It's a good music box to turn on when she is looking at books and other images (she is 9 weeks old).Got this as a gift.Your newborn will be amused at the sharp sounds and bright lights, all good for their development.Hello, and welcome to the land of musical toys.She couldn't push the button herself then, but she enjoyed watching the lights.My son is now 2 months old.When he was newborn, the lights got his attention, but then he would get over-stimulated.I know as he gets older and can push buttons himself, he will love it even more.I got this as a gift before my baby was born and thought- eh, maybe we'll use it sometime.From a very early age, the music and lights would catch her attention and keep her from crying.It took her a while to be able to hit the button on her own, but that is just a developmental issue.Note- originally I thought that the four different colors on the button were for four different songs.It is small and the music is pleasant.I highly recommend.My nearly six month old daughter can easily press the music buttons and make it go.The colorful flashing light display when the songs are playing is great!It was the most popular toy there!I think I liked this toy more than my son.I bought it when he was 3 mos.The music and colors are fine.Also sometimes when music is playing and u push the button to change it nothing happens (have to push it twice).Like most reviewers, I agree this is an excellent way to calm a baby down.It's the perfect size for little hands to hold on to yet small enough to fit in the diaper bag.The lights are nice and bright and the sound quality is great.When the grandparents visit, they always say the music gets stuck in their head's!Overall the quality of the product is good; it gets a rough beating from a baby.It helps her to eat and entertains her in a crib and/or her baby gym.She loves watching the lights flicker across the screen.The songs are also great because they are a bit longer than most.My son loves this.It was a baby shower gift from a friend who's son also loved it.She is now six months old, and she has enjoyed it throughout.I use it when I'm changing her diaper--if she looks like she might want to cry, I can distract her with the music and she will play happily with it throughout the change.The music is fairly enjoyable on this toy and a good volume level, but I had no idea how obnoxiously flashy the lights would be.My baby is 6 months and loves the music his glow worm plays and smiles when the face lights up, but the lights on this don't seem to appeal to him.My little ones have been enjoying it for a few months now (they are 5 months) We turn it on for them and they instantly are captivated by it.I love the lights and music it plays.No complaints here.My son (7 months) loves it and has liked the sound and lights since he got it at 4 months.My son loves the lights and likes to "skip" to his favorite songs.This little toy is portable and plays happy songs as well as has the attention grabbing lights.this music box plays very nice, active classical music and the flashing lights and easy one-button operation do make it one of my babies' favorites toys.but still a good entertainment value over all.This toy doesn't thrill my son the way the Baby Einstein toy piano does.I currently have it in our stroller pocket for when my baby and I go on our daily walk.Was supposed to be a Christmas gift but I could not resist giving to my daughter she is 4 months and it is hard to get her something to play with at this age but she loves it.Really is a must have, he's had it since he was 2 months and still loves it at almost 6 months.we just push the button and he stares at the pretty lights and quietly listens to the music.he's old enough to push the button himself now, and so when he wants we take it off the strap and hand it to him to play with.He has accidently droped it on the ground a few times and it still works great!Great Baby Shower gift or just a gift for your little one that is totally worth every penny.Seriously folks, this is an item I thought might not hit the mark.She's still too young to hold it with any sense of control but I either play it for her or I attach it to her exersaucer tray and she hits the button herself.It's an everyday toy that I bring to Day Care with her and the other babies who are older steal it from her and play with it.A hit!I picked up this toy because Amazon listed it the number one selling toy of my son's age group at Christmas time.It was under $10 so I figured why not?There are lights that catch the baby's attention too.The button doesn't take much to press which is great for young children who don't have good small motor skills.I've had to rescue it from his older brother's (3 & 5) rooms on occasion.The appropriate age range given by the manufacturer is 3+ months, and my 5 month old keeps wanting to suck on this toy.The nice thing is that it is small and portable, has two volume settings, and plays 6 classical songs in a loop (rather than the same thing over and over again) so you don't get totally sick of hearing it.I just bought this the other day for my daughter and she loves it!The music is nice, even in the loud position it won't grate on your nerves.I've bought several small toys in the hopes of keeping my 11 month old son entertained when we go out for dinner or even a stroll.Maybe it's the music AND flashing lights, but he just loves this toy.I attach it to his stroller with a sippy cup strap so that when he drops it (or throws it), it doesn't make it to the ground.I would give it 5 stars if it played more songs (I think it has 4-5 songs), but I would definitely recommend it either way.Another toy I would highly recommend is the Mozart Cube - that is another invaluable toy that keeps my son's attention much longer than any other toy.My almost 10 month old loves these.They're also nice because they rotate 360 degrees making it easy for the baby to turn and play with.It's the perfect step up from the Soothie.I love the shape and breathability quality.They also work well with any pacifier strap.My son preferred these, mostly because of the texture and shape of the nipple.I tried two brands of pacifiers for our son ... Avent and MAM.They also offer a good variety from clear, to simple translucent colors, to cute little characters.BTW, those Velcro or clip straps are only good until they figure out they can rip them right off.The better straps to go with are the ones with the snaps - my boy is super strong but he can't get those off.They also come two to a package, are inexpensive and come in a variety of colors.I highly recommend them.This one is just big enough for a few diapers, wipes, pacifier, 2 bottles, burp cloths, and an outfit change.I got this bag in the charcoal color, and my husband loves it as well.I bought then returned this item after getting it because it's way too small.Besides the size, it's really cool, I love the color and styleIt is a well-made, sturdy and attractive bag.Like I said, it's very handy the way it can clip on to the stroller so that you don't lose the valuable space beneath the seat.If you can get it at a reasonable price, go for it--you'll like it if you use a stroller fairly regularly.I wish all my purses had that feature!This style has tons of new colors.It is modern, feminine, and reminded me of a print on one of my favorite higher-end Orla Kiely bags.The magnets on the front of the bag still do not work well - when the bag is knocked over, contents readily spill out.The fabric is plasticky-polyester canvas, not soft.The straps still have a tendency to get twisted.The straps are also coarse and rough and made my sweater pill.The organization is nice - enough pockets for everything you need and the front "mom pocket" is roomy enough for your wallet, keys, lipstick, and a paperback.Side pockets fit my Kleen Kanteens.These keys are great.I especially love the traffic light.I would suggest these toy keys to any parent.It also is great to have it convert to a step stool.It doesn't pour like from a funnel, but I don't find it challenging getting the pee into the big potty.If you left the lid closed over it and it was moist, maybe it would get mildewy.I love that for girls, you can flip the foam seat over so the urine guard isn't in the way.Why can't they make more girl potties without that darn guard for the 50% of kids who pee down, not straight out?Oh well.My daughter loves this potty, and it has really made potty traning go smoothly.Recommended.By age 2 she's doing OK.  She always has a red ring on her tushy when she gets up.The cushioned seat is nice, but does stain, and clorox wipes don't help.The lid is big so when open, it takes up more room.My daughter has also fallen back on it and it hurts (we have it against a wall...well, as much as the lid will allow).We ended up taking the lid off because of that, so if you get it, I wouldn't put it on unless you travel or need it as a step stool.It does the job though & works as a nice step stool for my daughter to help me put laundry in our washer.I didn't buy it for the step stool feature, but daughter figured it can be used that way.I am sick of re-assembling it for her.And that's almost all inside the main pocket, with room still in the outside pockets!It holds a ton and doesn't even feel bulky and thanks to the cushioned shoulder strap, it doesn't dig into your shoulder either!Got this for our first infant and it's been great.Spacious and easy to navigate.Magnetic buckle is nice as are the stroller buckles.Distinctive multi colored polka dot is also easy to spot and see.The pockets are numerous and deep, the bag can easily attach to a stroller, and when I'm slinging it on my shoulder it looks more like a messenger bag than a diaper purse- which is good becuase I'm a man.It is perfect for quick trips and everyday use.I love how it has magnets instead of velcro closure.The multiple pockets are great.If you fill the pockets up - you cannot get into the middle part....I am always digging for stuff...drives me crazy.I will say the mesh bottle holder is nice but that is about it.The strap is nicely adjustable, and I find all the pockets helpful.It's just slightly more subtle and goes with everything without looking too girly, and it doesn't show much dirt.There is a zipper compartment inside but the rest just closes with magnets.Overall I really like this bag and see it meeting my needs for quite a while.Great diaper bag overall if you're not going to carry too many items.I can comfortably fit a few diapers, wipes, change of clothes for the baby without looking bulky.I find it a bit too small if I'm out all day with the baby and need pack additional items.I like the waterproof pocket for dirty diapers and the cup holder side pocket.It is way too small!All the pockets are great but if you put anything in the pockets you have no room inside the bag in the main space.I can hardly fit all that I need and I just have a newborn so there isn't a ton that I need at this point.The stroller clips are why I bought it and it is nice but not worth it when I cannot fit what I need into the bag.Pros:The inner pockets fit diapers and travel wipe packs perfectly.The fabric is durable and easy to clean.The magnet snaps make it easy to close the bag when in a hurry.The changing pad covers public changing tables well.The strap is very comfortable.It's fits snugly into the basket of the travel system.It's uni-sex and fairly stylish.Cons:The bag is tall and wide, but it isn't very deep.It's very easy to lose items under inner pockets.I wish all my purses had that feature!I wanted something that had a pocket for everything so I can stay organized.I also really like the feature where you can attach it to your stroller instead of having to either carry in or put it in the bottom basket in the stroller.It also comes with a small changing pad.Its nice that is comes in so many color choices so I could get something that my husband can use when I am not around.I decided to go by the reviews for this one and order, and it is absolutely perfect.I am able to fit a couple jars of baby food/snacks/spoon inside the little pockets.The stroller straps are great also, since I prefer to use my smaller stroller these days.The zip pockets on top I use to carry my own stuff, and the main compartment inside I have baby's basics: one spare outfit, a burp cloth, small receiving blanket, and my nursing cover (folds to about the same size as the blanket).I use the inner pockets in there to hold no more than 3-4 diapers, and a small pack of wipes in the other.The very back pocket holds the changing pad and sometimes my shopping lists.That said, I have two complaints about this bag:1.It's too small.The spit-up is all over both of us by the time I locate and carefully remove the burp cloth from the bag, so as not to disturb all the other carefully folded and placed items in there.2.The magnetic closures sounded like a great idea because I hate struggling to zip/unzip my bag when I'm standing at a check-out counter, but then I realized that magnets and credit/debit cards don't mix.If your cards get up against the magnets you risk ruining them.You can wipe them out if the magnets get too close.It was easily twice the amount of stuff.I didn't really know how large or small this item would be.I hand wash this and some of my sons other organic toys.He loves biting this.I want to buy all of the fruits and vegetables so my son gets used to having fun with them and then has a better experience trying each one.When she first began eating solids, we loved it because this chair allowed her to eat right at the table with us.It also doesn't take up additional floor space, which is great.After nearly a year of use, though, we now hate this chair.Our daughter is a fairly non-messy eater, yet the hippos, the metal parts, and the chair itself are always laden with gross food particles.It is also ridiculously difficult to remove the cloth fabric from the chair frame in order to wash it.While it is really nice to not have the chair take up extra floor space, that's really the only benefit to this chair.Unless you think cleaning food up from the hippos and the floor several times a day sounds like fun, and unless you savor the idea of having to wrestle the cloth part off of the frame... and the frame off of the table... then I really wouldn't recommend this chair.We bought this for a trip, and wound up using it every day at home too.We love the compact size -- no more tripping over the high chair in the middle of the kitchen!The clamps are deep enough to get around the trim under the table, and the rubber grips don't leave marks in the wood.The clip for the safety strap often sticks, so we sometimes struggle getting him unhooked.my one year old loves to throw his sippy cup.This is perfect for when we go to restaurants to keep from having to clean the sippy.I also like how it has loops that open completely at both ends (where as some brands only velcro at one end, making you loop the strap around whatever you need the cup attached to- very annoying and it shortens the strap by quite a bit that way).Wow, I love this thing, can't believe it's not on every shelf in America, I need another one STAT.I've only had it one day and I just love it!!I got these as a gift along with the Fresh Baby Trays at my baby shower.I made my own baby food and put it into these cubes, and then froze them.The containers aren't perfectly clear to begin with but I was surprised at how dirty they were right out of the package.Also, you must defrost them in the microwave to get the frozen food out.they lasted about 6 months of everyday use.They break easily (never ask a man to fill these)!This bag is beautiful!!I absolutely love the stroller clip/straps to make it so much easier on outings.I am so dissappointed....for the price, I would expect better quality.I still love the size and the color, and the pockets are fine for me....but the fraying of the fabric is bothersome.The concept of this bag is great and it has tons of pockets but the main compartment is seriously lacking in size.There is no possible way you can put something in every single one of the pockets, inside and out.It looks great though and comes with a fantastic padded shoulder strap and stroller straps.I have been on the hunt for the perfect diaper bag and have yet to find it.We bought this bag because it looks smart, and it's one that both my wife and I can use when we are out with our baby.Here's what we've found:Pros:- Looks great- Durable- Many pockets to put things away- The diaper changing pad is very useful when outsideCons:- Space is a premium.While there is quite a bit of pocket space, I think it doesn't stretch much, or perhaps we're trying to fill it with a lotThe bag can be easily wiped down with a diaper wipe or damp cloth if it gets dirty which is a huge plus.The size of the diaper bag is perfect, it's not too big and not too small.However, I would say to definitely get fitted by a lactation consultant before purchasing, as I needed a size small and a regular sized one.I have not used the item yet(have not had my baby).This is a no-frills, simple waterproof crib pad.I bought one for my oldest grandson.The best thing about it is the straps adjust easily.Also, the seat sits higher than others.The cover is easy to wash and looks fine after a washing machine wash, but it is not easy to put back on the frame.It is also only fairly easy to install, but that is because of how big and bulky it is.We actually have to have it on the side, not middle, of our Jeep Grand Cherokee, and that surprised me.It is really that large!We put our son in it at 10 months, and I think we'll put another child it it at 6 months.I cannot see how an infant could be comfortable in this chair.The headreat pillow does not hit well for small children.If it matters to anyone... the blue looks more like denim than a nice deep blue.I can see where some parents do a poor job of properly installing their child in the seat and the belts are too loose... really, it is easy to do this.I find that I have to tighten it a lot more than I expect to get a safe fit.If I had to do it over again, I would probably purchase a Graco similarly priced item for the shape/size of the carseat with my Jeep.We have this seat in the Lincoln color - dark grey and black - because it was available at our local BrU.So far, we love it.This is definitely a much more advanced seat than the one I used 10 years ago for my son, the Graco Alpha Omega which was rated #1 by Consumer Reports at the time.It reassured me that everything was where it needed to be and that the fit was right, rather than a preset that you may or may not be able to make slight adjustments to.The only complaint I have about this seat is that the lever to loosen the belts is VERY tight.We are very confident that it will protect our daughter should it need to do it's job.I do not know if it fits in the flex-use stroller bases because we just skipped the infant seat altogether and this seat has an attached, flat-bottom base.I do like that there is a level that is easily seen from both sides of the seat.We have already taken off the seat cover once to wash it when we sprung a leak.We still have not turned the seat to face forward as there is plenty of room for her legs in the backwards-facing position.Other than the stiffness of the adjustment lever for the straps, we love this seat and still recommend it to anyone that asks.This seat is still a top-ranked seat by Consumer Reports.We absolutely LOVE this carseat!!I got this item twice.And the item is working properly.I was stunned at the pricing of the various exersaucer's on the market.I couldn't believe that paying almost $100 or more would be worth it.Admittedly, the particular exersaucer I have (the model just before this one) was an older hand me down, but looks almost as good as new and keeps my 4 month old occupied and interested.It is easy to clean, has a lot of bells and whistles to pull, push and spin and is light enough to be moved around the house if you want to keep an eye on your baby.Very nice!I love it and so does my child.This is an excellent exersaucer!I also like that it plays music too!We highly recommend this though!I got this exersaucer at BabiesRUs when my twins were a couple of months old.We actually bought 2 different ones.My twins loved this!:) It allows me some time to cook and tend to my oldest.I actually started my twins on this pretty early.I needed for them to stay upright as much as possible in order to give their heads a chance to round up.The Smart Steps exersaucer helped a great deal keeping them up and occupied.They used this for a long time too.Even after they started walking, it was a great place to put them without getting into too much trouble (for much needed potty break, or in order to cook dinner).My twins are now 3.5 yrs old and are too old for this but I am using it for my 7 month old who is equally occupied and happy to be there.It's been in the attic for a while before my baby could use it and it has held up pretty well.With a quick wipe to clean off the dust and spot cleaning the fabric covered toys, we were good to go.It's very sturdy, too!My 5 year old and 3.5 year old twins now occasionally steps on it and bounces on it, yet it's still holding up.I highly recommend this!As a reference, our Son is 5 months old.There is a ton of stuff on this thing.Even after you remove a few of the removable toys it is still a bit much.This is probably more amusing for younger kids who haven't quite figured out how to grab, pull, and hit things to make noise.It looks like the jumperoo might last him another 2 or 3 months where this thing won't last another growth spurt.My daughter (5 months) loves this!We started using it when she was about 3 1/2 months old.At first she was only interested in one of the toys, but now has grown to love all of them.This is very sturdy, and easily colapses so you can take it with you.Great toy for an active baby that loves to standAfter the accident, we bought the Evenflo Triumph DLX and LOVE it.- It's easy to install- It feels very secure and does not wiggle one bit- It's easy to strap him in- It's easy to adjust the straps- It reclines more, so his head doesn't fall over when he sleepsHe goes in and out easily.I am so happy to have the Triumph (mine is technically the DLX), and so happy to be rid of my First Years True Fit!I've had this carseat for about a year now.At first I thought it was wonderful with the no re-threading and the knob on the side.The seat was easy to install but needed a rolled towel under the front of the seat for the proper recline.I'm happy with it because the straps are easy to adjust and tighten.I didn't really feel like spending more than $200 for another seat we wouldn't use that much...Installation: Using a lap belt installation is pretty easy (we only tried rear-facing as our daughter is 9 months so I can't speak for front-facing).I was *this close* to taking the seat back because when I first tried to install with the LATCH system, the straps were barely long enough to clip on to the latches.Turns out the seat comes with the straps in the front-facing position and you have to remove the cover to thread the anchor straps through the rear-facing holes.I don't like that the straps cut into her neck and left red marks after even just a couple of minutes, but I fixed that with some cheapie strap covers.Being our second seat, this will be taken out a lot (I'm making my husband re-tighten those LATCH straps for me) to put in our parents' cars, as they will watch our LO once a week.Britax is great, but if you don't want to spend that much, this is another good option.The construction is top-notch (Britax is not the only game in town for picky parents anymore), it's easy to install correctly, and I love how easy it is to adjust every facet of the harness (you tighten the harness with knobs, the shoulder height adjusts by sliding the straps up or down, and the crotch strap easily shifts to one of two positions).My son seems just as comfortable in the Evenflo as he does in his other seat--a Britax Roundabout.I am especially pleased with the placement of the two crotch strap positions.They are perfectly placed--not too shallow and not too deep.We are, by the way, very happy with our two Roundabouts.We needed another set of convertibles because our daughter will outgrow her infant carrier--a 2006 Combi Connection--in a few months.I think those are great seats too.You just have to see what works for you.Other seats you might consider: Safety 1st Complete Air (a great but pricey extended rear-facing seat); Graco My Ride 65 (a favorite of car seat aficionados and rear-faces to 40lbs); Sunshine Kids Radian 65 (recommended by a lot of car seat techs); Britax Frontier (hugely popular harness-to-booster seat (no rear-facing)); and The First Years True Fit (high ratings by NHTSA and very popular with parents).Rear-facing is truly the safest position for your child.In the event of a high-impact collision from the front or rear, a rear-facing seat will stop your child's head from traveling and allow it to "ramp up" the seat back, minimizing the chance of what is called an internal decapitation (the spinal cord gets stretched to the point of separating from the skull).In contrast, in the forward-facing position the car seat back does not absorb nearly as much of the crash force, which leads to the child's head traveling further and at a higher velocity.This increases the risk of severe spinal cord damage for kids under 4 because their bones are not yet ossified.You Tube features several videos showing how crash forces effect kids differently in the forward-facing position.Most expire at the 5-6 year mark.The Triumph Advance in contrast expires at the 8 year mark.I recieved some of these at the hospital and once my baby had gotten to the pacifier stage, he loved this one!I highly recommend this brand.We got a soothie as a gift and she didn't like it at all.It fit her mouth much better than a soothie (or other pacifier) and she could easily hold it with her hand at a young age because it is lighter (than the soothie).I highly recommend it.My son didn't like this pacifier, but he doesn't like ANY pacifier.I love that it's orange and easy to spot and has the nose notch cut-out.My 2 month old has been using these since day 4 when we needed extra help consoling her.She doesn't wake up once she's in a deep enough sleep when it falls out.I really like how it is shaped around her nose, giving her more space to breathe.Our baby started using this pacifier on day 1.They were given as a gift and 18 months later we are still using the same pacifier.I LOVE them!My daughter takes them with no problems and I love that they don't bump her nose with every suck.And they look so much cuter!I agree with other reviewers that mentioned the positive aspects that it is lighter than the Soothie so doesn't fall out of her mouth as easily and that it has the space for her nose.I am glad I bought the 5 pack because we can have one everywhere and have extras just in case.I can also use some of them for stocking stuffers since it is very important to my 6 year old that the baby have a stocking too.I bought the 5 pack being optimistic that I could get my kid to switch, but he would have none of it.They seem like a good pacifier but I think maybe the "wings" on the side touching his cheeks bothered him.My son had a heart condition when he was born, so when he was released from the NICU he had to go to the cardiologists where he had many tests completed.He was so angry at the doctors, that this calmed him right down.When I researched the soothie, I came across these and so far he loves them.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!I love this so much more than the Soothie.It's so much lighter than the Soothie so when it falls out, it doesn't wake up my son like the Soothie.Also, it doesn't over up my son's face like the ugly Soothie.The only negative thing about this is that it still leave marks on my son's cheek, but this might be because my son has extra large chipmunk cheeks.It was constantly getting touched by accident and going off.It got to the point where I was hearing that frog music in my sleep.The songs are pleasant and the volume is a good level.the dunk and swirl method is gross!the spray is powerful enough to spray off the nastiness without you having to get your hands all in it!My 1.5 yr. old daughter has just begun feeding herself, and after searching for forks that actually work, are BPA free, and won't hurt her if she jabs herself in the mouth or face, I can happily say that I've found the best toddler spoon/fork set!Even the spoon is well designed: she actually gets a mouthful of food on it and eats effectively!(Other spoons were too small, or too deep, this is just right!)The look of accomplishment on her face is so rewarding!...but I think the fork and spoon parts are a little bit too big.My son is a big boy, but he often hits the sides of his mouth while trying to feed himself due to the size of these.I love these bowls.I put a frozen food cube (or two) in one section, some dry cereal in the other, and hit the town.I was excited about trying out this chair - I'm sure it would be perfect for others, but unfortunately this one seemed too small for my 3 month old (I didn't notice, are there different sizes?)If you read the description & instructions, it clearly states that you should NOT place your baby on an elevated surface in this chair.And you especially shouldn't leave your child unattended in the seat, either.Common sense.I have twin toddlers and a newborn baby... and love that I made this purchase.pros:backpack style for hands free walking with kidsstroller latches on the straps4 mesh pockets (2 outside and 2 inside) to keep bottles and sippy cups.separate pocket area for diaper changing accessoriesfront pocket for personal items like Mom's wallet and phonecons:inside backpack area is smaller than expected especially if you're trying to fit books or toys inI love this bag for many reasons: high quality fabric that I can tell will last me the next few years; beautiful patterns to choose from (I got the blue bouquet - the colors are gorgeous); the pockets and compartments are so well thought out and allow me to be so organized so I'm never searching for anything - everything has its place...and you can fit a TON in here and it's not even that big!I bought this when the shadow waltz pattern first came out.I LOVE the pattern and the pink inside is gorgeous.The main compartment if very large it has 2 mesh pockets on the front and another mesh pocket and a zipper pocket on the back.There are 2 bottle pockets on the outside (keeps sippys or bottles cold or warm for up to 3 hours).It has a back pocket that has the memory foam changing pad in it.The front had the mom pocket and a bottom pocket with more mesh pockets in both of those.I would not want to wear this as a backpack around for more then an hour because the straps are not as comfy as traditional backpack straps, but for what I use this for it is perfect.I have two of these, one for daycare and one for home....Baby LOVES them to pieces.I'm just pissed that it strank so much and looks nasty now.So I'm very VERY careful to only line dry these blankets from now on.My son now has three of these blankets, in varying sizes and colors.He likes to rub his face against them when he is feeling sleepy, and he gets a lot of comfort from them when he is feeling fussy.When she saw the little balls and reflective dome, her eyes got really wide.Ive seen it in two colors; the multi and the pink.I dont believe the image shown here for the multi is current, because its royal blue, not light turquoise as shown.Overall, this rattle is a great price, great quality, not too loud, and easy for baby to grab onto.My son enjoyed this rattle earlier than his others.I expect as his hand-eye coordination improves, he might return to this old-favorite.I love the colors and sound that it makes.It is very easy for them to hold onto.my 4 1/2 month-old loves it, the intertwined handle makes it easy for him to grasp, and the nubs on the end are just enough for him to get in his mouth.when he was younger i attached it to his carrier with links and he enjoyed looking at it.overall it's a simple, colorful rattle at a great priceWe just got this in today but our son loves it already!He's just under 4 months old and it is easy for him to grip and he loves holding it in front of him and looking at the bright colors and even shakes it around.I like this rattle since it is easy for my 4 month old to grip and shake.The colors on it are great to stimulate his brain.The "DNA" style of rattle handles makes it easy for tiny hands to grip on, it is also very light so they can pick it up faster than some other rattles.Being lighter if they hit themselves with it less crying as well.The beads inside make just enough noise to make baby happy but not drive the parents up the wall.Bonus is if they toss said rattle out of their car seat while out running errands it makes a nice rattling sound so you don't lose it!Our son has favored this rattle as our "travel" one for the past 3 months.They look great to me -- nice and chunky, brightly-colored -- but she shows no interest in them.Other babies might like them, but there are far better teethers out there (my baby loves the Winkel Teether and the Bright Starts Flutter Links).EDIT: Now that my daughter is older, she likes shaking these keys and gnawing on them!I bought these keys for my 5 month old to teethe on.Love love love these!They are really big which is exceptionally nice!We received these as a baby shower gift and while I had heard good things about A & A had no idea how wonderful these are.For our summer baby who runs hot, they are the perfect weight to keep her snugly wrapped without overheating like she can in the standard flannel swaddling blankets.The other reviews are amazing, but these are too big to swaddle my (9 lbs.There is a ton of extra fabric when swaddling.Also, they are getting crunchier with each wash, not softer.They are good looking and somewhat useful, but not as swaddling blankets... BTW, the fabric is GAUZE not muslin.You can make your own gauze blankets for cents on the dollar compared to this cost.We LOVE these blankets.I was skeptical because they were so expensive, but boy are they fantastic!They are very large, so they are perfect for all kinds of things.It did take a little practice to swaddle with them when he was a newborn because they're so large, but once you get the hang of it they work beautifully.They are extremely soft and high quality and don't seem to stain easily, tear, etc.We had to wash them several times (6-8?)I know I sound like I'm exaggerating, but honestly these were my single favorite (and most used) baby item that we registered for.Overall, great blankets!Although we never used these as wraps, they work great as light blankets.They are so soft and lightweight.Perfect for tummy time blankets, covers in the summer, or whatever else you can think of!The price is well worth it, I think.I was concerned that they would really shrink in the wash- even though they say pre-washed.They didn't shrink at all and are still massive!I will definitely be giving these as gifts at baby showers, as well.Highly recommend.UPDATE: My daughter is now 5 but still uses these for lounging sometimes and with her baby dolls.They are still in excellent condition.It's more trouble than it's worth.Takes up a little more room in the diaper bag, but the reliable privacy is worth it.I bought this for nursing on-the go, but I have to say, I don't get it.I have very few shirts that open at the top for nursing, I usually have to lift my shirt to nurse my baby.Now that I have my baby and have been using it for 2months I can say I do like it but it's not as great as I thought.Once it's folded, you can tip it back to push it instead of having to carry it and the bar across the back (rather than separate handles) makes it great for one-handed steering.I have twins, but I did once use it with an infant and a three-year-old and it didn't feel unbalanced, still easy to turn.The harness should all be one strap in the first place.One of these days I'm going to figure out how to permanently attach these straps, and then I'll love this stroller (as much as anyone can love a double stroller).This stroller is fantastic.It also rides wonderfully for my toddler and infant.It is very easy to open and close.This combi double has a great pattern, the seats recline, it's light, and it folds nicely.I researched this stroller a lot before deciding to purchase it.It is lightweight and folds fairly small.My chicco carseat fits in it because there is a strap for holding in a carseat.But the cons outweigh the pros for me:*after using this 5 times just for walks on the sidewalk, the stroller started to seem rickity to me.Upon further inspection I found that one wheel does not touch the ground anymore.*The frame just seems cheaply made and doesn't go well over the tiniest sidewalk cracks.If this thing cost under $100 it would be worth it, but for the price it is NOT worth it.Oh yeah, and Combi customer service won't do anything to help me out with this wheel problem, they just say it is normal for strollers to be like that (?).I did so much research on double strollers before i settled on this one!I LOVE it~!I don't have twins, my main reason for this stroller purchase was a trip to Disney w/ my 3 kids, 8, 4, & 10 month old.It folds up quickly, the baskets are a nice size.I solved the cup holder issue with an added purchase and it works great!I highly recommend this stroller!!!!!!!!!!It is easy to maneuver even though I now have well over 40 lb of baby inside.The straps are somewhat cumbersome to adjust but maybe this is the norm for strollers.I would still highly recommend this stroller (but the stroller organizer and sunshade accessories are necessary in my opinion).I loved the colors and the mod look.I also didn't receive a manual, but the lady showed me how to remove the padding because I always want to wash things.It is also kind of hard to remove the fabric parts because you don't want to ruin the wire running from the bottom of one side to the top, which is for the vibrate and music feature.I thought it would make more sense to have the buttons for music and vibrate down at the bottom, near the battery compartment (so you don't have to worry about the wire, but it isn't that way).I also like the 2 positions.this little toothbrush is awesome.it is super-heavy duty silicone, dishwasher-safe & soft enough that if your child falls with the brush in their mouth, they will not be injured.this was designed by a dental hygienist mama!my littlest one LOVES this brush.he chews on either end & also lets us brush his teeth with it.it is the perfect size for little hands & little mouths & so much safer than a regular toothbrush.I bought this carrier when my son was 10 months old.I love that this carrier is both a front wearing and back wearing carrier.It is easy to adjuct for different people to wear and very comfortable.I have several other carriers/wraps and this one by and far has the best distribution of weight.When I opened the box I was really impressed with the quality of this piece.The stars are beautiful.He even had space to wiggle but not enough that I felt he was unsafe.I was also able to readjust this carrier to fit my husband for baby wearing in a few minutes.I also like that this carrier has a small zippered pocket large enough to carry a diaper or a wallet.I would recommend this baby carrier to anyone considering getting one.We bought the Galaxy Grey so hopefully it wouldn't be as hot during summer months.It comes with a sleeping hood that's attached and you can fold it into the pocket when it's not being used.The front-carry is the easiest and quickest position.I'm loving it!!!Highly recommended.She loves being snuggled so close to me.The pocket on the front is perfect size to fit my keys, a small burb cloth and a binky (we use soothie pacifiers).My daughter has tried many carriers and she says this is the best, it's very comfortable and easy to wear and my 3 month old grandaughter loved it.However, she got red marks on her legs 2 times.I like this color as it's not too hot and has a girly touch.Maybe I am missing something, but my arms do not bend that way, so I have to clip the chest/back strap first and then pull it over my head, which is not the most comfortable maneuver.But it gets the job done, so whatever.-When doing the back carry, the hip belt digs into my belly.I don't really use it for fast trips, but I use it for anything longer than like 15 minutes, and I use it instead of my stroller to take walks around town and stuff.Then it clicked and it was all OK, so give it a chance and try not to give up in frustration.This is great because you can carry on the front OR back which is a life saver if you have a lot of bags you need to carry.The only thing is that it says don't use until your baby is 4 months(I think) but I wouldn't use this one until your baby has really awesome head control.I didn't particularly care for the infant insert, it was kind of uncomfortable and it didn't make much of a difference.If your baby just started having head control, then it's still too early.It is really simple to get your baby on your back if you follow the instruction.I used the Maya wrap on my daughter and I found that I was still holding her to support her.I get my son onto my back in literally seconds.The sleepy wrap is hotter, and it made my son uncomfortable because he was being held so tightly with so much fabric.After a while my son would start to sag down as the fabric loosened, and not to mention that you can't hold your baby on your back with the sleepy wrap.I love this color it goes with everything stays clean and very stylish.I love it!i live in Alaska & it was wintertime when she was born.. so i can't imagine living somewhere warm & using it.got the Heart 2 heart insert, cuz she wwas only 3 moths old when i got it & it was great!but i deal with it fine.I have a peanut shell, new native, chicco, and a moby.I bought this one because I found the sling carriers to difficult to position my newborn so his chin wasn't touching his chest (to avoid positional asphyxiation).This carrier is perfect!Its SUPER easy to slip on and off, with the insert my son is safe and secure and we both can feel comfortable for much longer periods of time.I'm taking a plane trip with my newborn alone, and I needed something that would be easy for me to navigate the airport easily by myself and with luggage, and this fits the bill.I also like that my husband can use it too (with the waist extender belt)--if he can pry it from me :)We actually have two, one for each kid; and we've given them as gifts.Before that, the kids are really too small for this.Also the Ergo Sport has a longer strap.I bought the Ergo Baby carrier after using the Baby Bjorn; I liked the Baby Bjorn but it was killing my back and I was getting tired of having to drape a light blanket over my baby's head to keep the sun off her face (hats weren't staying on when she moved her head).It does show spots a bit more, but that shouldn't be an issue given baby poop, food, and spit up are on everything anyway.I do wish they had a better way of keeping the hood secure...the pocket only goes so far.Also, it might be better to have pockets on the waist strap rather than right behind baby's back.Finally, be aware that the ends of the buckle straps are folded in under elastic bands when you receive this item.It is easy to put on and adjust yourself.I put it on and adjust it to my comfort as I go because sometimes after walking for a few minutes I will notice more pain in my back or shoulders, so I will adjust it to be more comfortable.You may prefer it for comfort or an added feeling of security, but I found it to be too bulky and just not necessary because I was able to easily tighten the carrier to hold her right to me with no risk of her falling out or being in an uncomfortable position.I really like that this is so simple to use though, because I not only use it when going for walks, but I find it very useful for doing chores, like the dishes, when she doesn't want to stop fussing and let me get things done.At first I didn't like that it is so bulky and didn't seem to fold or anything for storage/carrying, but then I found that I could wrap the waist strap around it and buckle it to make the whole thing a little more store-able and portable.This was well worth the money - more comfortable and more secure than the one I used for my last child.Works great for walking the two large family dogs at the same time.I also use it to just "wear" him around the house when nothing else will calm him.It is very comfortable for me to carry around my 20+ lb 6mo and he loves being in it!I obviously have a big baby but I did use the infant insert until he was about 14 lbs, and then I continued to tuck his legs underneath him because developmentally he wasn't ready to straddle.As he continued to grow, I started only tucking one leg in, and by 5 months he was ready to straddle.I am constantly on the go, and this carrier is so easy to work with.greatest baby item we've bought!!!my little boy is 2 months old and is sooo happy in our ergo!the infant insert is a must...but keeps him snuggled and warm!!it's my favorite baby item.it's awesome.highly recommend.feels great!I use it everyday and sometimes it's the only thing that will calm down my son.It's also great for nursing the baby discretely.Worth every penny.It is very versatile and sturdy.The head cover is very nice, especially for flu season when strangers think that they need to breathe on your baby!I love the front zippered pocket.He also likes to chew on the hood straps, which keeps him occupied.You can discretely breastfeed in it, but I found that more trouble than it was worth.It is very comfortable, and we'll easily be able to carry him up until the weight limit on our backs.My son won't ride in a stroller for long periods of time, but he's perfectly content in the Ergo.Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.* The fabric is soft on the inside and sturdy on the outside.* The pocket is the perfect size for my wallet, keys, AND camera and it is an extra pouch from the body of the carrier, so it doesn't force those things to stick into my child's back.* There is a small pocket behind the pouch in which to keep the hood.* The nylon straps are high-quality, allowing for easy one handed adjusting.* It washes well and is well-made: i.e., it lasts through multiple children.Our son is almost 3, 38 lbs and 39 inches and still loves it.* The side-wearing position is elusive.DH used it several times when our son was about a year old and liked it, but then couldn't figure out how to do it anymore after a few months, perhaps our son grew out of that position?OTHER:* The Ergo is made in China with Fair Labor Practices.My baby loved it!The design is awesome & my baby is really comfortable w/ it & it seems to support him well.We have been using this carrier since our son was 5 months old.He is 22 months old and although we don't use it everyday like we used to, it is still getting a lot of use.I have used this carrier while grocery shopping, running errands around town, hiking, at the beach, while traveling, while working, getting my son to sleep every night for many many months, cooking, doing dishes, cleaning.Its really helped my son stay content while I have 2 hands to go about my daily life!2.It feels effortless carrying my son in this carrier.I'm very petite but still manage to carry my son's 26 pounds very easily.My son loves it.He loves the front carry especially but also likes the back carry.The hip carry helped me put him to sleep very easily when he was under a year old.I love having him close to me.It feels wonderful!4.I was able to and still can breastfeed in it very easily and very discreetly on the go.The hood feature is wonderful for that.Its incredible freedom.6.Son slept in it peacefully and comfortably in the front position and back position with the hood.9.Front position very easy to learn, hip position easy to learn, back position takes a practice and patience to learn (but worth it).Initially, until I felt comfortable getting our son in it myself, I had my husband just put our son on my back.CONS:1.We couldn't use this carrier until our son was 5 months.Our son hated the cradle carry.I don't know about the new heart to heart insert since it wasn't available when I purchased the carrier so I can't say if its been improved upon.3.Until then, I primarily used the front carry.Of course, this I never considered initially, but only after hearing other parents talking about it.I wish the company would manufacture this in the U.S.I would gladly pay more to make sure it is safe and that it hasn't been sprayed with anything on its way over from China.This is minor but an annoyance nontheless, when I use the carrier in the back carry position, the straps dig into my hips and create an ugly "muffin top" look.It also tends to pull down on my jeans to the point of having to wear a belt with some of my pants or risk my pants falling down (again minor but annoying).The front straps tend to also push my bust up making it look like I'm going to spill out of my shirt (and I'm an A cup!).It has been wonderful and useful and continues to be used and enjoyed by our family.Hope this helps!EDIT: I've now seen the new version of Ergo and it responds to a lot of my complaints (below).The straps no longer slide off and you can get a back pack for it.The new generation may have improved things, but do try it on to check these issues!This was given to me, and all my friends love it.In the back position, until the kid is 2, you need someone to help you get kid in if you don't want to risk a brain injury (I'm athletic, thin, and flexible, I'll add.In the front position, there is NO way you can reach and adjust the sternum strap (necessary to keep shoulder straps from falling off) by yourself.The sternum straps constantly fall off the shoulder straps when you are changing them around.During that time, shoulder side carry works, but a) is incredibly painful on your shoulder and b) the strap runs right in front of baby's face.My kids HATED the sleeping head rest (but, I admit, are comfortable in the carrier, but only in backpack position.)The bjorn is brilliantly designed for easy use but is very uncomfortable (I have big babies).There must be something out there is that is intelligently designed AND comfortable.It becomes a great carrier for travel once kids hit about 2 - it works very well as a *TODDLER* carrier.Our 4month old loves sitting at the table with us now; he's even started to make chewing motions while we eat!We move it into the kitchen area where he watches us cook.And we also place some toys on it for self-play.I would prefer if the seat reclined independently of the tray, which is probably asking too much for a seat under $30.At our son's age and ability, I wonder if he should be sitting upright for as long as he does and he's ahead of the average baby when it comes to sitting.For long-term, regular use, I'd look for something of higher quality.They cried every time.I only put one of my sons in this chair for a few minutes at a time when they are completely awake and I have nowhere else for them to go.We bought the bebePod when my baby was 4 months old, and now she is 6 months old and she still uses it daily.I keep it on my kitchen island and she sits in it when I wash my hands after a diaper change, as I prepare dinner, or when I need to do a few chores around the kitchen.I bought this seat for my 3month old, and my mom was skeptical as she's so young.All it took was a receiving blanklet around her (she is 13lbs and 25in tall) and she was able to sit up perfectly.I have friends who have the Bumbo seat, and it seems like this one accomodates a wider range of sizes and also has better back support.I was hesitant to purchase this item, even when i was able to purchase it for almost 75% off (I love these amazon deals).It is MUCH more than that and will serve multiple functions for you and your family!It is truly amazing.The item DOES have opening for a 5 point harness system AND works for the belts on a stroller.Because the fleece blanket can easily be taken out .it means when the weather becomes warmer (which is often does in the area I live), you can easily remove the fleece blanket, allowing the entire system to be lighter AND you have a fleece blanket if you JUST need to use that.This item is truly amazing!It is adorable and multi-functional!So far it's been a great bed and our daughter has loved being a "big girl".Got the espresso finish since it was the cheapest of all the color options.Espresso usually is so dark brown it is almost black & this is not that dark.But, still a nice color.It was easy to assemble and the price was great.Since my daughter, who is 2 1/2 wont be in this bed forever we didnt want to spend a great deal on it.It matches her toyholder and she is so proud to have a "Big Girl Bed".Seems very sturdy for what she needs as she is still under 30lbs, this should last her until she moves to a Twin size bed.Delivered in less than 48 hours.Slightly challenging to assemble.I figured this out by the last one.It was late when I put it together.The jumper is great.The keyboard is cool for me, but not very interesting to the baby at this point.This has a LARGE footprint.But it won't topple over, that's for sure.I haven't seen any other jumpers in use in over a decade.The music plays by motion or touch, with the baby einstein one, you have the touch, pretty hard, the piano key in the right spot.This jumper is perfect!We started using it when our baby boy was about 4 1/2 months old.He loves it!And when he's out of energy he explores the different features.He loves grabbing it and bending it, and most of all he loves chewing on it.The seat is really wide so you may have to add extra support by wrapping a blanket around your child.It's a great alternative to "tummy time" for babies who like being in an upright position.I feel this was a great purchase that my child will be able to use for many more months!We started using this bouncer when my son was 4 months old.Now, he's 10 months old, and he loves to bounce in it.My son is big for his age (about 24 lbs and 29"), so we have the bouncer on the highest setting, but he can still bounce in it without any trouble.He has enjoyed playing with the toys that came with the bouncer (a piano that either plays songs or single notes, a teething flower, a frog that spins, a mirror, and a flower that twists and makes noise).Also, I took the seat out to wash it, and it was fairly difficult to get it back on.Overall, though, we've been very happy with this bouncer, and our son has really enjoyed it.The jumper has been great entertainment for my 8 month old son.I bought this when my son was 6 months old and put it at the lowest level.He was in the 50th percentile for height so I was surprised he could not touch especially when the jumper supposedly can be used by four month old babies.Many infant items now say don't immerse in water.However I used a blowdryer right away as not to rust them.I also love the height adjustment - 5 adjustments.And my kiddo loves it.My grandson loves hisBaby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper.33L x 33W x 27H inches.When he was younger, he loved theBaby Einstein Around The World Play Gym.We purchased this for my son, who was born 10/21/09.He is very big and very coordinated for his age, so we started him in it at a little before 4 months (package does not recommend this, but we supervised).He didn't get much use out of it when we first started using it, which discouraged us at first, but now that he is a solid 4 months, he LOVES it!Also, there's one spot with "anchors" to put your own toys - would rather see another activity or just a blank tray to put cheerios.UPDATE: 6/21/10 - My son is still loving this bouncer at 8 months.I really think the loops for hanging objects helped develop his hand-eye coordination and reaching skills earlier.Pros:1) Easy for parent to adjust height (but not too easy in the sense that my son couldn't mess with it.My son got a lot of use out of it and it is still in great shape to use for another baby down the road.Cons:1) Just comes with linkeroos it would be nice if it came with hanging toys my son did like the weird flower and leaf thing, though2) I often shut off the key board as it is way annoyingSEE THE PICTURES I SUBMITTED... my son clearly loved using this toys and I have a feeling your child will too!I also love the multiple height settings, although it took 7 months before my LO's toes could finally touch the floor on the lowest setting and she's not a short baby.2: the piano keys have to be hit in a very specific spot at a very specific intensity, or they do not make any sound.It would be better if the keys were more sensitive because the sound is what makes baby want to play with it more.We also got him the Baby Einstein Activity Center and he likes that too, but he loves that jumper more.When we bought this, my son was 5 months old and 95th percentile for height and we had it set on the lowest setting and he fit perfectly.The seat is a little big, but he doesn't seem to mind.We attached the Baby Einstein bendy ball on one and a teether on the other.We went into a store and checked out the Fisher Price jumperoos first and they felt wobbly and not sturdy.I wonder if it was because it was too close to her face.Unfortunately I will have to return it.Took him a couple feedings to get used to the transition from Slow Flow to Medium Flow but everything is peachy now!My son has been using medium flow since around 2 months as slow flow was just too hard for him to get milk out.At 10 months he is just now switching to Fast flow.Definitely worth a try!They're still too fast for my 4 month old.She seems like she struggles to keep up with the flow.You can attach it to the front of the pack, the back of the pack (waist straps) with velcro, or you can carry it with the strap that comes with it.Fantastic design.You have one zippered front pocket, an open pocket behind that, then the main zippered pocket and a small zippered compartment within that.There is room to spare, too.Definitely a great addition to the Ergo pack or just on its own.I hardly use this item...I bought it for when I go traveling so I can store items in the pouch without having to take my purse.I haven't traveled yet.It is IDEAL for working mothers.I've even received compliments on my "nice bag".In addition, I know many other mamas that have used Medela pumps and have no complaints about them.this is worth the investment.bought this item and it works wonders.I was AMAZED when I started using this.I wish it had a little more space in it for some personal belongings so that I didn't have to bring a purse in addition to this bag.It would be nice to have them separate if you want stronger stronger suction and slower speed.Overall this is a great pump.I don't know if it's worth the price but in my opinion it's a necessity.The carrying case is nice and discreet.She pumps bottles for our son to receive while she is at work.She uses it every night and finds it to be very powerful."Based on how much she likes this model, it seems safe to say that this pump is worth every penny!I used my first six years ago, with my son, and bought another when I had my daughter and went back to work.I found the PIS to work just as well.Parts are well made and pump is fairly quiet (considering what it is).I bought this not long afterward and toted it what felt like everywhere for the first 6 months.I definitely think that for what you are doing, you want something that will quickly and effectively do the job.I ended up leaving this at home on a vacation because it was just too much gear to take along for a weekend trip along with all of the bottles, etc.I have been using it for quite some time now, and I love it more than ever.Must have for all working mothers!Pros:Very easy to useComes with almost everything you needVery attractive bag (doesn't even look like a pump)Cooler/Ice pack are very usefulWorks as a single or double pumpComes with a battery pack that can be used when an outlet is not availableEasy to cleanBuilt wellCons:Pricey (Worth every penny if you can afford it)The bag is slightly small if you are trying to use it to contain all the pump supplies and also use as a purse.You must use the bag as it is basically attached to the pump.Additional breast-shields may be necessaryBattery pack takes 8 AA batteries and eats through them quicklyNote: You can purchase additional supplies (such as the breast-shields) so that you don't have to wash them before each use...this was very helpful to me.Love how fast it pumps and LOVE that the pieces are dishwasher safe!The baby is bundled as well and the Boppy must be a good replication of her comfort in the womb.This is the only breastpump I've used since I've had my son so I can't really compare it to anything, but it's definitely discreet.No one even knows it's a breastpump which I love.I found this In Style pump to be just as efficient and certainly easier to carry around.PROS:-The backpack is awesome!I love that it is large enough to carry all of my pumping paraphernalia, but not so big I feel like I'm carrying a piece of luggage.Still closes fine.Also very discreet...If possible, ear plugs or headphones with an iPod would help.They say relaxing and thinking about your baby helps with pumping, but the noise was a hindrance.-The cord could be a little longer, but honestly it hasn't proven to be a problem.I am overall very happy with my purchase and hope that it doesn't burn out on me!My only complaint is that its a bit bulky for me.Both daughter and daughter-in-law received this item as a gift from me.Both were very appreciative and after months of use, not one complaint.It all packs up into a stylish backpack that is easy to tote around.I bought this last year right before my son was born.It does the job but I think next time I wont get such a light color.it stains and didn't come out in the wash.However, I ended up using it even before that during a long drive to visit family one weekend.I just threw on the nursing cover that I use for breastfeeding, and then hooked up to the light plug-in as we headed down the highway.I have a 2010 Pump in Style model and didn't notice a difference in the power as compared to the AC adapter.Works perfectly.You really can fit a lot in it for its size.The insulation is nice and the outside pocket is perfect for a travel wipe container.It came out very nicely.works just as good as anything else !I received one of these kits when my daughter was born and I bought one for myself when my son was born.Easy to use and makes a sweet memento of these precious days.The final ornament makes a nice gift for parents (or grandparents).Also the edges of the mold are not smooth and are rough.It is beyond beautiful.The details on the bedding are amazing.I would highly recommend this bassinet!And my infant loved the rocking and womb sounds.Luckily, I wasn't moving it much anyway.I used this in my home office and and didn't use it much for bedtime since I would have to get up to look inside the bassinet due to the high sides.For me at nighttime, a co-sleeper is better.I loved the design of this bassinet, and the music is pretty cute, but I found that after a couple weeks of use, the gliding motion became jerky and made too much noise to keep it in our bedroom.For the price the movement should be much smoother and quieter.i'm happy i got this seat as a gift because i wouldn't be happy if i had paid for it myself.my newborn will sit in this seat for no more than 20mins.maybe if the colors were brighter it would be more effective.so most of the time we remove it.the legs on this thing come out farther than the actual seat so it's not the easiest to move from room to room especially if you have your baby in your arms.not the most practical if you have a small place.3 stars for the 20 minute breaks it gives us.We are pleased with its aesthetics, as well as its performance.The vibrating feature was great.The seat is pretty shallow and my son (5 months) can't seem to get comfortable in it.I bought this swing and the matching bouncer after a lot of research.The best part about the swing is that it plugs in.No batteries - priceless feature.We'd buy again in a heartbeat.I know it's a little pricey but it's worth EVERY penny!My son loves this swing.It is sturdy and seems secure, and we love that you can change the direction of the swing.It also looks great--it doesn't stick out in your living room like so many crazy-colored baby items!And I love that you can plug it in or use batteries.The colors are beautiful and the design itself is nice.It's not too flashy and looks good in my livingroom, which typically I would like.The fact that the seat detaches is a great feature.The blanket is also nice.Also, who needs a tray on an infant seat anyway?Now, besides the removeable seat, much cheaper swings will do exactly the same, plus have an entertaining mobile.I guess it's just if you want to pay the extra to look stylish in your home.It is made beautifully, so it goes great with my furniture.I called FP and their customer service was great!My daughter LOVES it.It is comfortable enough so that she can fall asleep easily, but sometimes she wants to be siting up looking at me and can't really do that with the seat so far back.My husband did the assembly, so I can't say much for the instruction that go with it.The unit as a whole is easy to move around (remove the seat first, then carry the base unit to where you need it).So far we are very pleased with our purchase.It's very smooth and comforting for my two month old.I only wish the mobile moved on it's own.We loved it!The music it played was really beautiful and peaceful.If it had a larger seat and a moving mobile, I would have given it 5 stars.My son and I absolutely love this swing!Colors: I love the colors and it goes well in the living room - blends nicely, as opposed to bright blue or pink swings... which brings me to my next positive: it works great for a boy or a girl.While the attached blanket does have a little pink/red bow on one side, that can easily be hidden if you have a boy.Motion: The swing goes left to right or front to back.I don't see a huge difference in speed... the lowest setting and highest setting seem to be the same speed and distance.Maybe it's just me, though...Entertainment: The music is appealing to adults and babies.You can listen to classical music, "zen" music, or the sounds of nature.Suspended above baby is a nice mobile of zenlike creatures.Size: It is a big piece but the frame folds up to an L-shape and fits easily in any closet or even against the wall.The seat, as it can be used independently, can go anywhere.My only complaint about this product is that the mobile does not spin on it's own.My son LOVES staring at it and I think it would keep his attention longer if it moved.My son has had this toy since he was 3 months and he is now 7 months and this is still his favorite!There are so many different colors and textures and sounds!He has a squeaker in his belly that always gets a laugh from my boy.One paw has a textured teether in the shape of a leaf and the other has 2 rings with different textures.There is a lots to touch and mouth.There is also a large clip at the top to make it easy to attach to car seats, bouncers, strollers, etc.Pros:- Lots of textures- Crinkle paper- Teether- Rings- Hook to attach to things- SqueakerCons:- None that I have foundMy son has loved this toy for 5 months now and I'm sure he will continue to love it for many more!He wasn't interested right away, but started to be around 4 months as he could hold it better and move it around to feel and mouth different parts of the elephant.These are the perfect addition to use the Playtex Drop-In system with the Medela PISA.The system works great with my Lansinoh pump.I have used this with both the DROPINS and VENTAIRE WIDE/NATURAL SHAPE.Playtex offers a variety of nipple (slow,medium,fast,variable,&cereal;) flows so it is easy to find a nipple flow that matches your flow :), also a very important factor when switching.Pros to using the VENATIRE WIDE/NATURAL SHAPE is that they're reusuable so no additional cost like the dropins.After pumping, remove the adapter ring, put on the sealing disc (both the silicone and hard top work great with these), and place upside down in the fridge.We used this system with every size of liner (4,8,&10).Just warm up some water in the microwave, and then plop the liner into the water.We warm the Ventaires this way too, it only only takes a few minutes longer).When the bottle is warm just put the bottle ring onto the holder, remove the sealing disc, & the nipple ring will screw right onto the bottle ring.These are awesome...If the first kit had come with two, I wouldn't have needed to order this one!But, it's handy to have the extra lids to prevent bottle leaks while on the go.!Another issue that I've ran into is as they transition into larger bottles, you probably still are going to have lots of 4 oz frozen bottles.I have tried to freeze in the larger liners, but they do not freeze well...they expand and you have to thaw them b/4 you can remove the ring.no complaints.also nice to not have to wash a ton of bottles a day.also, we used the slow flow until about 7.5 months (he's an EBF baby), then switched to fast flow, which seems to make him happy.This works great in this capacity.However, anyone who is purchasing this kit primarily for storing should be aware that they may have problems.Additionally, like another reviewer, I remove the seal and ring once the milk is frozen, and collect the frozen drop-ins into freezer ziplocs, because you cannot buy the sealse separate from the kit (or at least I couldn't find them anywhere).We absolutely LOVE it.Our kids are more comfortable in these and we find them easier to operate as a whole.I have recomended this to many friends as the option for a forward facer :) (and have had a few convert to these as well).Bought this for my 15 month old and we both like it.I love the cup holder.Very easy to get her in and out of it.It is easy to buckle him in.It seems like he has a lot of room, and is quite comfortable for him.I'm happy with this purchase.The furthest crotch strap slot on the Graco Nautilus measured at 6.5 inches from the back of the seat.My son was almost sitting on the Graco crotch strap in its furthest position and he's only 10 months and SKINNY.The material on the Britax Frontier 85 is sooo soft and smooth, but still SAFE (rock hard on the outside, cushiony on the inside).4.I highly doubt that!BUT the harness strap on the Britax Frontier 85 is LONG!!!!!And here's the best part -- I'M HIS MOTHER AND I WAS ABLE TO SIT IN THE SEAT AND STRAP MYSELF IN!Most importantly, the crotch strap was still NOT under me.That means my son can grow to my size and still remain harnessed!Not that he'll need to be harnessed when he's my size, but the option is there!That's how I know I made the right decision.I have been a loyal Graco customer since my son was born.!My son hasn't been in the Britax for a drive yet (cause he's still too little), but I imagine it will be very comfortable (to the point of sleeping in it).He loves it!Go for the Britax Frontier 85 over the Graco Nautilus... you will thank me!The younger one is creeping up on 20lbs.It was easy to put together.The older one said it was more comfortable.It's very easy to buckle and unbuckle and it was pretty easy to install.We have this next to a rear facing Peg Perego right now and they worked fine together.Very happy with the choice we made.If you have to adjust the straps to a higher notch the liner doesn't fit well and makes it hard to tighten/loosen straps.So the black part you see inside the seat comes out leaving the silver liner.UPDATE: March 2013 We've had these for a couple years and my girls love them!I have since bought a 3rd one in December 2012 for my 3rd child.The newer model changed the buckles a bit.I still had to remove the liner because it would slide down Nd I couldn't adjust the straps correctly.I have a 5.5yo (42" & 36lb) , 3yo (36" & 32lb) and 18mo (33" & 26lb) old all in the same carseat - different adjustments and all are fine!I do wish the drink holder was a little closer to the child because my 18mo can't get her cups out.Breastfeeding is so frequent, I use this pillow MANY times a day.We will continue to use it while she learns to sit up as well.This is something I purchased before my son was born - wasn't sure if I really needed it or how much I would use it.I have since discovered that it's a MUST HAVE!!It will shed feathers all over you and is not comfortable!I primarily use it for nursing.This cover is wonderful!I love the material, it is much softer than my other cover, so it is much more comfortable for my baby and for me.I definitely recommend a soft cover like this one, the extra comfort is worth it.It fits the Boppy pillow well, not too loose, but not tight either.The only thing I would change is to have it actually be reversible, with one color on the inside and another color on the outside.Instead, one color is on top and the other on bottom.We will wait to use it so we can face her frontwards.Baby started out at 8lb - he needed an extra head support, but a rolled up baby blanket did the job until I managed to buy one - and at 26lb is still very comfortable in it.I can't tell you how many times I've scraped my knuckles trying to get the straps snug, and I worry a little that other parents (or myself) might not tighten them as much as they should, simply because it is almost impossible to do.Aside from that, it's working well, and we're very happy with it.I'm sure a more expensive seat would have some nifty extra features, but this does everything we need.If only there were another way to tighten the straps, it'd be almost perfect!Easy to set-up, light, and seems comfortable to my baby.I bought this carseat to use at Grandma's house 1000 miles from our home.The carseat fits in a standard size sedan, is easy to install and secure, and it seemed to be a safe seat that withstood high outdoor temperatures for my 18 month old / 22 lb daughter.We use this seat in our secondary vehicle, so we appreciated that it was a lot less expensive than most convertible seats.It comes in great colors that are gender neutral, which is nice too.The cover on the seat washes well and doesn't hold stains/smells even when you just wipe it off with a damp cloth.Overall, it would be a great purchase for a secondary, grandma's, or babysitter's car, but it doesn't seem comfortable enough or easy to release if you're using it multiple times a day.They don't pull evenly, so I do spend a bit of time making sure the lap belt connection and shoulder straps are all even-steven when I pull the tightening strap, er, tight.That's because they're all one strap winding all around the kid (pretty normal for the car seats I've used), but there's a lot of friction making it anything but smooth (again, compared to the other seats I've used).So, unlike the other seats, which I suppose we'll sell once we're finished with them, this one will be a give-away or destined for the trash.Update 7/8/11: This seat is still holding up well after nearly a year-and-a-half in use.In fact, I think the higher "off-the-seat" profile of this seat gives him a bit better visibility outside of the car compared to the Combi Corroco seats he rides in in my wife's car and my father's truck.Honestly, there is absolutely nothing special about this carseat, at all.I had a Graco Comfortsport, that was nicely padded, comfortable, and most importantly, easy to tighten.This is the 5th carseat I have owned, and I have always installed them quickly,easily and TIGHTLY.It also didn't come with an instruction manual, so whatever words of wisdom they might have given me, I don't have access to.It is thinly padded, I don't know what my little one thinks of it, but if it was my hiney, I would be doing some complaining.If I do manage to get it level, it is wedged up tight against the back of my seat, under the headrest.Doesn't seem very safe to me.But there is always a little nagging thought in the back of my mind about this one.My daughter is rear facing and will be for the next year or so.I bought two of these for my twins.I give them four stars rather than five because (1) they aren't blue as advertised (they're black) and (2) I had some trouble installing them rear-facing using the latch system in an Acura TSX.I had to get a really strong neighbor to pull the straps tight enough.It takes brute force.Also, the seats don't recline quite as much as I would like them to.Another thing potential buyers should be aware of: Some Cosco Sceneras seem to have more padding in them and have higher quality fabric than others.I love them and most of all, the children are safe and comfortable!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!We bought two of these seats to fly with since they are much lighter than our regular Roundabout seats.Kneeling on the seat and pulling the strap as hard as I could managed only a loose fit, which my husband could only improve a little bit.Adjusting this  makes the process of buckling in two kids longer than it needs to be.), but we'll definitely stick with the Roundabouts for everyday use.Works great at keep the seat cool.Easy to use and works as advertised.My 14 month old twins both figured out how to pull these apart in the first couple days.These, well, they get the job done.They can't pull out others so I know these are simply not tight enough.Ones that are smooth plastic, rather than with the ridges that make it easy for a 9-month old baby to figure out!At first we thought the design was clever - ridges used to attach to electric cords when in use - but much too easy for our baby to pull out.We started offering this cup around 10 months and now at 18 months my son still loves to use it in addition to other cups.Great for traveling!Snoopy is cute.We live in a one bathroom house and have a (almost 2 year old) we started potty training.It was becoming such a pain in the butt (no pun intended) to take the removable seat off and on when we went from adult to child.I think it is the best solution on the market.The kids love the new potty seat.The seat is very sturdy and well designed.It has a nice solid/safe feel.The kids transition from theFisher-Price Precious Planet Potty, Froggy Friendhas been quick and painless.Issues-1.My 2-1/2yr old son has to hold him self up.The slow close hinge could work better.It bows out giving less space for the lid.The adult seat is ok, but the seat original the toilet was more comfortable.It is heavy enough to hurt if dropped on a finger.This is an awesome idea.It's such a great thing, it just needs to be improved.I absolutely hate regular flannel recieving blankets that babies grow out of immidiatley!Both my 9 week old and 2 1/2 year old love these blankets!!!!I LOVE these swaddle blankets!!!It so lightweight and breathable and SOFT!I love how big each of the blankets are, so I can fold them multiple ways and make it thicker or thinner depending on how warm it is.It's the perfect shower gift!These are among our most used baby items for our 7 month old.They get softer with each wash (and this is sooooo true)!They are trendy yet amazingly functional.My son never liked to be swaddled but he does love to cuddle with these blankets.We have the jungle jam set and they are cute for boys or girls.I love the giraffe one the best!I highly recommend these to all new parents, but I warn them not to put them in the dryer.These were the only swaddling blankets we used.I first saw my neighbor using them and I was amazed at it's feel and touch.And now it becomes my baby's security blanket.She must have the blanket touching her face to fee secure enough to fall asleep.My newborn, husband and I love these swaddle wraps by Aden + Anais.Love these.These are great, they are big enough to swaddle my growing baby (he's 5 months now and still need to be swaddled).They also make great blankets, covers, playmats and anything else you want to use them for.Especially great for summertime.I got the Super Star pack and love the colorful stars.They are so lightweight but still warm, and most importantly breathable!I rest a little easier knowing it's not like the standard plushy baby blanket that might be suffocating/overheating.Love these, so soft, big and comfortable.Best to use during summer when baby needs just a light blanket.Had these sent next day delivery and couldn't be happier.They are a large size, stay wrapped, wash beautifully, and are breathable.We keep our bedroom cool (66-68 degrees) and using two blankets at once, plus a little cap on her head, keeps her warm without feeling clammy (a problem with the Halo fleece sleep/swaddle sack we tried).Yes, they are a bit pricey, but for us they've been worth every penny.The only thing I would change: I wish they had brighter/non-white based colors.I just received my blankets and they're better than I expected.I love the feel and pattern.I highly recommend them, especially for summer babies.Love these swaddling blankets!!They are super soft and HUGE.My daughter is a 17 lb 6 months and it still perfectly swaddles her.Beautiful star design too!Great size for swaddling baby.These are not only bigger, but the thread quality/count is higher than the swaddle cloths produced for one of the companies.They really do become softer the more you wash them.Just like Indian Prefolds fluff up and become all nice the more you wash them, these are really soft too!They get softer with every wash!These jumbo blankets are wonderful.We look at other receiving blankets and can't believe how tiny they are!They are worth every penny!Nice to see that the price of these blankets are coming down.But even at $44/set, they are worth it.Depending on the print, the original is virtually the same price, and totally worth in, in my opinion.Because of their huge dimensions and light weight, these are the most versatile baby blankets.Have had them for over a year, and they are holding up well.Great for using as a stroller cover, to put on the floor at people's homes, soft for wiping up my baby's face, wrapping him up.I've ordered a couple packages at different times (the ones with free shipping seem to be that way).The one that wrinkles nicely - is not from Amazon (it was a gift and she bought it from Target).I've bought 2 sets of these so far, and at 18 months my son is still using them and they are still big enough.They are very light and breathable, I even folded one up to see if I could easily breath through a few layers, and yes even through a few layers breathing is still easy.My son seems to enjoy the designs and sometimes carries them around, so I can only assume he likes them too.They seem pricey at first, but after I got them, they become an everyday must for my baby.The size is large so it's perfect to swaddle the baby.It's soft and becomes softer after a few washes.Definitely worth the price!These will last through the end of summer.These are great swaddling blankets.Bought these wraps even though they were pricey because of the cute patterns and the fact that it was muslin, so I knew they would be warm yet breathable.They make swaddling so easy and I use them for everything.They really do get softer with each wash and I know they're going to hold up for a long time.They're exactly the same thing and cost 29.99 for a pack of 4.The cons are 1- No volume control which would be ok if it was at the usual kid toy decibel level.So far it's been more of a play thing for my child than a drinking cup.I love them!We got these bowls when we started our son on solids.The lid closes absolutely shut and all you have to do is add water when your baby is ready to eat.We also use it to put puffs in.These lids are tight enough that it keeps puffs from getting soggy.Our son absolutely loves these bowls because he associates them with getting his puffs.All in all, we recommend these to any parent starting their baby on solid food.We bought this crib because we lived in Manhattan when I got pregnant and needed to stay in our 1 bedroom apartment for 9 months of my son's life.We needed something with a small footprint.We considered a bassinet or mini crib but figured then we might have to buy a crib anyway before the 9 months was up.We had no idea how fast our son would grow.It has lived up to its expectations on all of those fronts but failed miserably on the most fundamental aspect....structure.We continually have to tighten the bolts in it.Just today I went into my son's room to find him w/ one of the bolts in his mouth!!!!We have many items we have had to assemble at home as we are avid Ikea shoppers....but never have we had an Ikea item fall apart.Well I had another son.We got an Ikea crib for 100$ and I am not expected to tighten the screws and it is a million times sturdier.Here's the reality:YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE A FEW TIMES AT HOME FIRST!I tried it both ways, as I pre-boarded first, and experimented at the back of the plane with him while everyone else fought for their seats up front.Simply open the tray table behind the seat, loop the strap around, tighten until it is snug, and close the tray table.He would have been angry anyway if I got them very tight.If you have a very tiny child, you might have a concerns.He never moved, slid, etc...Takeaway: Practice at home first.Take a seat toward the back of the plane to give you plenty of time for setup (won't be a problem, as all airlines allow families with small children to board in the first third of all passengers).Be an attentive parent during the flight.Keep your child occupied with a toy, food, whatever...Adjust the straps as necessary.Common sense stuff!Lastly, BE REALISTIC about what this is meant to do.It allows you to have an FAA approved permission-slip to sit your child comfortably in an airline seat, and gives the airlines an out if your child is hurt somehow during turbulence.I bought this when I was making a trip across country on my own with an infant and my 2yr old.This was a good deal for me.The straps pressed into his neck.I also wish there was a way to have a strap between the legs.Overall, I am happy & will use it again.We bought this after our son kicked the seat in front of him repeatedly one flight.This keeps him from being close enough to the seat back in front of him and he also finds this more comfortable.The only complaint we have ever really had was that this is not a 5 point harness so if our son is particularly squirmy then he can get out at the bottom of this as there is no strap between his legs.ZIt was great!He loved this so much more than the car seat on the plane.Okay, so I make my own wipe solution and I give one wipe a couple of squirts.I toss them into the diaper pail and I'm done.My only complaint is I wish they were softer but I'd buy these again for their cleaning ability.The only thing missing is the friction brake(s) on the wheels and my brilliant husband remedied that problem by wrapping yarn around the inside of each wheel 'til the wagon moves the speed we want (cut the yarn off, or unwrap/rewrap to adjust, when baby is ready for a faster push)!So far, our nearly 9 mo old is sitting on the seat, playing with the toys and pulling himself to a standing position on this sturdy wagon (doesn't fall over and he's a BIG boy at 23 lbs).Thanks to the other reviewers, we feel we made a quality choice!but you cannot have this one, it is the best and only one that our baby took to the first time and a year later still loves!He walkes around drinking with this one since most cups you have to hold completely upright then they cannot see while drinking, not this one, you can hold parellel and still see.my son loves this sippy cup , he is 2 now.the cup  has held up nicely.it does not leak at all, and i haven''t had to change the teats yet.This is my 2nd favorite sippy cup.This is a nice in-between.I have to loosen the bottle to let air inside to it pops back out.Not sure why, but this doesn't happen on the other bottles.I received this bag as a babyshower gift and have been very pleased.It fits very snugly so you have to get everything lined up perfectly to zip it.Having done it many times now I know how, but it still takes time, which as anyone with a newborn knows, is valuable.This wrap has a a very bright and colorful polyester outer and trim, and the inside leaves the PUL layer exposed for easy cleaning I suppose.The leg gussets are a nice touch and the aplix closure system is very sturdy, hasn't curled or pilled, and allows this wrap to be fully adjustable.It is also roomy, making it great for prefold diapers underneath.As I mentioned earlier, this wrap is comparable to the Thirsties wrap.They both have gussets, aplix closure, and an exposed PUL iner layer with a polyester outer.I have expereinced cracks in the PUL, separation of the PUL from the polyester, discoloration of the white trim and aplix, pilling of the polyester and aplix, and curling of the aplix with Thirsties.I treat all my PUL covers the same.Shipping was fast and their customer service is great.I highly recommend this wrap!P.S.I wish I could return it!THE GOODIt's been working for 5 months.The chair will not work!The fabric is scratchy and my child seems uncomfortable being in it.I mean everywhere, there are tons of nooks and cranny's for food to get stuck.CHOKING HAZARD!!!!(This is the strap that attaches to the back of the chair)Assembly for this chair took a while and not fun to put together at all.If anyone has a recommendation for a different one let me know!Very pleased so far, I'm a new dad and after extensive research, friend's recomendations and reviews these car seat has made our life very easy, it performs as advertised, it is light (at least for me), seems to be very comfortable for our daugther who sleeps on it for long periods of time, it seems to keep the baby very worm (great for winter), easy to install, good quality of materials, hard plastic and elegant yet resistant fabric, seems very safe, instructions put lots of emphasis on safety.It fits securely in the Babytrend stroller frame (new parents out there this is the lightest & easiest folding frame, better than graco's) my wife and mother in law are very comfortable using the car seat.It's been 5 weeks and we are very pleased, hope this helps, good luck with your baby!Second, you can only adjust the straps one way by elongating the top straps, you cannot lengthen the piece that goes in between the baby's legs that the straps snap into.One last note, the strap adjustment is under the baby's legs which is just awkward to try and blindly thumb around to get to after your baby is in the seat and you want to tighten up the straps!My husband and I decided to purchase a Graco infant car seat after the good experience we had with our firstborn's Graco travel system.We wanted a color that would pair nicely with the Graco Snugrider stroller frame, and this works brilliantly.The photo makes the light color look almost silver though, when in fact the seat is black with a khaki/beige accent color.I expected that from other reviews I've read, and it's still neutral and sharp looking, so we don't mind.Once we received it, the seat was easy to install in our vehicle (Latch system) and the sun shade was really the only item needing assembly.The material of the seat pad, head positioner and foot muff is extremely soft, which I appreciate for our tender little newborn.It was nice not having to spend the extra money on a car seat head positioner, this one works just fine for our compact little 7-pounder, and I'm pretty picky about his comfort.(Not recommended at all, but shows how light the seat is.)As expected, we're finding this seat to be extremely easy to use, comfortable for baby, well-constructed and attractive.My baby loves it; it looks great and it is a very good quality; I wished it was just a bit ticker but otherwise it's perfect.My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the penguin being one of them.He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part.That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up.I highly recommend Wubbanubs!I love this changing pad because it is so soft and it washes really well.It has been through the washer many times and has held up beautifully.These pads have been invaluable.We ordered another 2-pack so we would have extras on standby for when the others were in the wash or soiled.We keep one in the crib, one on the changing pad, and anywhere else our baby is and there is the potential for a diaper blow-out (i.e., on top of the Boppy pillow while nursing) or a spit-up mishap.After quite a few washings, the pads are holding up well, no pilling, and still doing their job.I washed in warm water to work on the stains and that worked good, after first rinsing w/ hot water and treating with Bac-Out stain remover.So far it works and washes well.It can be a little tricky to keep it from bunching up when he/we move around at night, but that would be true of pad.I love these pads and use them for everything.I love how soft they are.I put them on my baby registry and thought I had gotten too many (I have 6) but now realize that it's the perfect amount - I can have some in the laundry and still plenty for all my uses.I use these on the diaper changing pad, instead of other covers.Works great and is cushy feeling.Only complaints I have are that they were slightly smaller than I expected, and puffier than I expected.However, I can just use the other waterproof pads I have for that stuff and use these exclusively for the changing spaces-- so no big deal.Just be aware of what you're buying.One additional comment, and this may just be my EBF baby and my washer/well water, but for some reason all the 'organic' cotton items we have stain a lot easier than the non-organic ones.I ordered only one...thinking, if I didn't like I'll just return...it's perfect!!Very happy about that.I use this in between the cloth cover and my quilted changing pad.I was looking for an organic pad and this does the job well.I am going to order another.This "sippy cup" is a fast flow bottle.Purchase the straw cup instead.I have a Maclaren Volo and love it, but I wish it had some kind of cupholder with it.I'm not so sure about the incuded mini carabiners to hold bags- this seems like it might create a tipping hazard if your child is lightweight or gets out of the stroller.With these two items, the cupholders are a fail.I did get both of my cups into the holder, but both were way too tall and caused the organizer to tilt precariously even with only one at a time.Cupholders that actually work!Munchkin straw sippy cups won't fit.16.9OZ water bottles go in with a fight.The storage compartments are nice.They seal great for quite a while.They work best when installed perfectly, which can be difficult.Recommended.However, its important to remember that the reason its easy to pull down is because its made of a light, super breathable material.I'm really comforted knowing that even if she wiggles over and smushes her face up against it in her sleep, she will still be getting plenty of oxygen.Sometimes good ole traditional items are still the best!It fits easily and velcro-ing it is a sinch.I can see her thru the weave as well, which is nice.I have a smaller crib that I put next to my bed, and I did find that I had to somewhat weave the bumber in order to make it fit.As it is two pieces, the second piece being for the drop down side of a full size crib.I bought these because I just wasn't comfortable using the padded kind.This works great on both counts.Overall, very pleased and the colors were very true to picture.It works great to do that.I got the universal size and it fit my sleigh crib fine.But if you are looking for a padded bumper, just be aware that this is not the bumper for you.I did not want to use a standard bumper and thought this would be perfect since it is boasted as suffocation risk tested...Well, we received it in the mail today, eagerly put it on the crib and it doesn't fit, in any way shape or form.This has been great.So for peace of mind, I bought this bumper.It's easy to put on, stays put when changing the sheets, pretty pink color, and you really can breath through it!Wish I had know about these strap covers before my daughter was born.My daughter is 20 days old and the car seat is so uncomfortable for her, especially the straps.But now she doesn't mind being strapped in so much because she has soft fleece rubbing on her face instead of rough straps.I haven't tried the satin side, but they seem very soft and comfortable as well!They do keep the straps from rubbing his neck though and that is good.I like that they are reversible so you can have the fur in the winter and the quilted in the summer.They also remove easily for washing.They are a little better made and larger than the munchkin straps covers and I like this better.They're easy to attach.I have been extremely happy with this bedding set!I purchased this before my son was born, he is now 11 months old and the bedding has held up like new.This is so adorable, and it doesn't stand out to much.The blues within this set are very calming, and the soft material is perfect.Other than that it is wonderful!It took awhile for him to get the technique associated with spoon-feeding, but the shallow bowl on the Munchkin spoon was very conducive to easing his transition to eating solid foods.We purchased the evenflow glass bottles and originally planned to use the Nuk silicon nipples for our breastfed baby.We began a search for a nipple that he would accept that wasn't too fast flowing for his strong suck.The texture and softer consistency of this nipple are more appealing to our baby, who still prefers the breast to bottle feeding.Suction is great-I've never used the highest level.Still happy with my choice.I started out with the Freestyle because I travel for work and was attracted to the weight and size.So when I read a review of the new Freestyle I decided to keep my eye out for a used one.Now, I know Medela calls breastpumps single-user items, and I know why.*The timer is great.*I prefer the Freestyle tubing & parts.So far I have been dissasembing the parts and sterilizing them after each pumping session and the parts seem to actually work better after they have been steamed this way.***UPDATE***I have now been using the Freestyle for a month at work, and I still love it.Of course, the pumping band helps the most- it is awesome!I am using both regular and softfit breast shields- I do prefer the regular as the softfit occasionally leaks (occasional drip) but don't have enough of a problem to buy another set of regular shields.I also occasionally have suction problems with the softfit shields that are remedied by tweaking all the parts, again not a huge problem but prefer the regular shields.Here are some of the things that have made pumping easier for me:*Pumping band!!!If you can use the setup that comes with the Freestyle I applaud you.For everyone else, a pumping band will be well worth the expense.*Because I am pumping at work and at home, I bought a second set of parts and horns so I can leave one set at work & one at home to minimize the stuff I have to cart back & forth.One day after 4 months of use (and on my first day of work nonetheless), the pump-in-style just lost suction and died on me.Size matters -the FS is the size of my hand and can be carried anywhere, the PIS is like a piece of luggage.2.I have been using it at least 4x a day for the past 5 months.I take it to and from work every day.If I just plug it in like is recommended in the manual instead of physically holding the tube closed, the suction is terrible and I can actually hear the air escaping.Okay, I might be reaching here.It works.I'd heard some complaints about the noise, and while this thing isn't silent, it's about the same as the others I hear in the lactation room at work.The size.Everything must be dry, assembled right, plugged in perfectly....If you lean over to scratch your knee, milk pours out.I'm a 34DD but i cant imagine that it would work comfortably for anyone that is bigger then a B cup.The pump works like a charm...no complaints there.There are many parts and clips that need to be attached to the bra.No more being attached to a large bag, no more looking for electric outlets, no more dealing with tiny parts/membranes.It has great suction power - I am comfortable using the power settings 3-5 currently.I like the stimulation phase/expression phase features and the timer as well.The hands free option and dual pumping is awesome!It is well worth the extra $$ in time savings.I just absolutely cannot fall in love with my Medela Freestyle.I understand that many people love it (it is almost $400, so someone loves it), but I really have more complaints than compliments.If you so much as lean forward or - Heaven forbid - tip a bottle over while the flange is still screwed on, there goes your entire pumping session.Bring a spare pair of pants or a towel to work with you if you plan on leaning forward at all.I have to hold the pump on my lap for my morning sessions because it vibrates through the floors and the wall and wakes up my husband and baby.They advertise the 2 different suctions - 1 for let down, 1 for pumping.Yeah, my (other cheaper brand)pump has only one suction and works just fine.They stain and get all bent out of shape.I love my Dr Browns bottles, but washing all those parts got old really quickly!I bought enough baskets for a day, and this has made daily bottle cleaning easy.The parts from Dr. Brown's bottles fit neatly and securely into the easily identifiable slots.As an additional plus, these baskets can be used to hold bottle parts from other manufacturers.If you are using Dr. Brown's bottles, you definitely want to add these dishwasher baskets to your list of items for purchase.I liked this item until I had them in the washer and it turned the bottles and parts a different color.I am not sure why/how it did that I didn't have anything in there of that color.I also wish the basket held more parts.These bottles have special parts (i.e.a long internal tube, plug piece, etc.)I think this basket makes it easier to wash everything.That said, it is not essential.Before buying it, we just put the small pieces in the top rack and maneuvered them so they would not shift in the wash cycle.Overall, this rack is worth the money.It makes it much easier to wash the bottle parts for the Dr. Brown's bottles.My little one just loves to chew on this nice big soothie pacifier.She liked the pacifier part just fine, as it's the same as the regular soothies.I like that is's only one solid piece so less chance of her gnawing it to bits.I'm going to keep it around until she's better able to keep a grip on it.I had read a lot of reviews about other models falling a part and becomming choking hazards so a one piece product was a must for me.She will chew on all the different parts and it is easy for her to hold by herself.:) (She is getting another round of teeth now so I am crossing my fingers that is does its job a second time around. )And while I'm not concerned about choking, it was clear he needed something 'more'.As soon as I received this, he happily took to it.He seems to enjoy the extra material for holding onto it while he moves it around his mouth.It isn't the teething golden grail of a toy I was hoping for, but it seems to be a nice addition to his chewing-things collection.These are great pacifiers because they don't roll as much as the regular soothies.They are also great for a teething baby to suck on.My 5-month old daughter love it.It's small, fit my petite girl perfectly.Good teether for small size babies.(She was born slightly premature.)I bought this because I love how lightweight the fabric is.It's perfect for summer weather.However, she can EASILY wiggle out of this.Our Halo swaddling blanket works much better, but unfortunately it's too warm to use during the summer.All in all, I'm glad I bought it.I have tried all the swaddlers (Miracle Blanket, Woombie, this one-originally made by Kiddopotamus), and have found this one to be the best for my babies.Fresh out of the dryer, though, for the first couple of uses, it is great!My kids have managed to wiggle out of the Miracle Blanket (and never seem as comfortable), and the Woombie doesn't keep their arms down well enough (she brings her hands to her mouth so the blanket is soaked in the morning).I wrap it very tight, and while it is a tiny bit stretched out when she wakes up, her arms are still inside.I don't like the lids, however, since they have the removeable part in the middle.These Evenflo bottles really are an exceptional value.They come in two pieces and absolutely annoy me as they don't stay together as well as it does not form a perfect seal when closed.Excellent, cheap bottles!These bottles are compatible with the Medela personalfit connectors, and the wide ring collars.These little bottles are great for pumping and storing.My son prefers these bottles to anything else we've tried, including Vent-Aire and various glass bottles.They are simply problem-free, with no dripping or leakage, and a very comfortable nipple (according to our son).At $1 a piece, we don't worry about losing or damaging them.Sometimes, cheap and simple works just fine and saves parents a lot of hassle.Bought this for myself and so far have enjoyed using it.Useful accessory for holding snacks and little containers.The flow is a little fast.I read reviews and bought stage 2 for my 6 month baby and still it's a little too fast for her.Perfect for toting bottles back and forth from daycare.I can fit 3-9oz Born Free bottles just perfectly!If you're looking to buy HH, you're comparing them to bG's OS as well, no doubt.Pros:HH do fit a little longer/larger than bGs.They come in tons more colors than the bGs.Cons:They leak moisture at the legs, especially if your child has chunky legs, stretching the elastic gussets more.I'm a first time cloth diaper user and was skeptical about the pocket diapers to start with but these have opened my eyes for sure.I used it quite a bit when I got it.It does work as a nice cushion, but face plants will still hurt.Then I stepped on it accidentally right after wiping it down.It still does it's job, though.I did replace it with a nice area rug in my living room now instead, but I know I'll always find other uses for it.We haven't had any accidents yet using this, so I can't speak to its absorption/protection qualities.i originally bought this for the pack & play mattress, but when I saw I didn't need it for that, I just used in the regular crib under the crib sheet & it works great.Can easily wash - love it.great price, too.This is one of my two favorite blankets for swaddling my newborn son.Although a bit big for swaddling a 8+ pound baby, and not a square, it is super soft, stretchy, and I like knowing I'm providing an organic, dye-free blanket.Now that my son has grown and is over 10-lbs, the blanket is easier for swaddling.We love this blanket!It is the softest blanket we have and it is well made.I highly recommend this.I also love the color, it's simple.Provides a little extra warmth while still being breathable.Now at 14 months, she likes to stroke it between her fingers as she self-soothes to go to sleep so this has become more of a comfort object.We bought this for our 10 month old and it quit working after the first day.The stacker is wonderful with all of the shapes and colors!It's really neat to watch the snail go with the stacker on top.The snail doesn't go so well on carpet, but that is ok, it's more spontaneous that way.My 10 month old son loves this snail!They should remove the pictures if that's not what they're selling.My son loves the toy, so I'll keep it.But for what it is, it is not worth $30 + shipping, even with the extra shell!However, that doesn't mean that, if we're holding him and walking him around, he doesn't go right for the snail.He loves that he can push the button on the tail to make the music start and dances to the music.This snail was great at first.Our 18 month old Grandson was coming to visit and we needed to make sure that he wasn't going to be able to get into certain kitchen and bathroom cupboards for his safety.I found these and bought 3 packs of 3, which was allowed us to lock up the necessary cupboards and even ones we weren't concerned with.White terrycloth on one side, woven or knit patterned fabric on the other.It's the terry cloth that makes this an absorbent burp cloth for all kinds of spit-ups.I don't think the terry is any stiffer than a cheap towel (other reviewers complained that they are scratchy), but realistically these aren't as soft as minky type cloths and regular cloth diaper burp cloths.I'm giving only 4 stars because one of the cloths has a knit fabric which shrunk, causing it to be smaller than the terry cloth it is sewn onto.But the other three are great.I didn't expect to love this so much.It makes cleaning all the pieces to the Dr. Brown's bottles so easy.I would recommend ordering 2-3 of these so that you can wash more sets at a time.They actually pick up messes unlike many other wash cloths that are sold!Also I did not have to remove the stroller fabric to use our City Mini with the car seat adaptor.I had read that it was recommended to to, but felt it was not in my best interest to do if it was necessary, and for me it wasn't necessary.But this is a must have for my City Mini.My one year old son loves to sit forward and hold the belly bar.We have had our City Mini double stroller for 14 months now and love it.A friend with 2-year-old twins mentioned that her boys love pulling themselves up on the belly bar, so I decided to splurge and order it.My boys occasionally pull themselves up on it but with the design of the seats, they are always reclined a bit at the most upright setting so that's a little difficult/uncomfortable for them.I bought this for use on our Baby Jogger City Mini stroller.I highly recommend getting this over the snack tray.Would definitely recommend this item to go with the stroller.The nipples are a little too fast for my baby but I use the Avent nipples and they work great!No complaints at all!It keeps my very active 15 month old son from slipping in the tub and it looks cute.Packaging also causes it to be so tightly rolled that it still hasn't flattened out months later.I bought this bathmat for a number of reasons.It seemed like the perfect no-slip mat, but it was too good to be true.These hooks work great they are sturdy attach easily stay in place and rotate 360 degrees so you once you attach them you will never have to do it again.I'm so happy I got this.It's very sturdy and durable for my Baby Jogger Twin stroller.Very easy to attach, and very strong.I like how the organic fabric is soft, natural and doesn't keep the baby too warm.It is much more stretchy than some other fabrics available, which means it fits a wider range of baby sizes, but can be easier for bigger babies to wiggle out.Since she started rolling onto her tummy, we've had to move onto theHalo Innovations SleepSack Organic Cotton Swaddle - Cats and Dogs, Newborn.I'd highly recommend it for any parent, but don't order the large size until you see if your baby is rolling over at an early age (or you have an abnormally large infant).He was 6 lbs 11 oz at birth and when we brought him home he was 6lbs 2 oz.My son is now 6 lbs 6 oz and I can tell this won't fit him much longer!My son won't stay contained in this swaddle.Its organic!I've since updated this review to include other swaddles I've tried out on my son from birth to six months.I hope you can use my experience when factoring in if this swaddle is right for you.If you are still on the fence, these are other swaddles that I tried with success on my son.muslin swaddles-- these are great for a classic swaddle and  are also great as burp cloths once your baby outgrows themMiracle Blanket -Baby Swaddling Blanket -Beige-- this worked by far the best for us.He used this from birth to 6 months of age.Plus if your child no longer likes to be swaddled you can remove the swaddle portion of the sleep sack.1+ Months to 6 Months:[ASIN:B000G0L2TM Miracle Blanket -Baby Swaddling Blanket -Beige]] -- when my son got too tall for this, we took his legs out of the pocket and just swaddled his arms)aden + anais blue oh boy!My baby didn't love it.This is a really nice mat but I can't say that it's made tummy time any more enjoyable for him.Our son is a large baby but the frog pillow is a nice size so it works well.I use the mat anytime I put the baby on the floor to play because he likes to look at the bright colors.It's nice to have something in between the baby and the floor.Don't expect miracles with this mat but it's worth a try if your little one doesn't want to spend any time on his belly.I got this item as a gift for my baby shower.I put my son on this everyday and he is getting stronger at lifting his head.At four months, he has just started enjoying the activity even though he's been using it for over a month.The removable leaves have become one of his favorite toys since all of the pieces fit in his mouth, and he can grasp the toy with his hands.I like and dislike that the u-shaped part is removable.I don't like it because it creates almost a hazard if he is not monitored 100% of the time.He starts moving off of the cushioned surface to the floor which isn't as baby friendly to his skin.That makes the piece very versatile.This tummy time mat is great, it has beautiful colours and is nicely designed to keep baby interested while on his tummy.I love the pattern on these bibs.The front of the bib is easily wiped off.The American Baby Company Organic Embrodiered Receiving Blanket in Mocha is my favorite and most used blanket that we carry with us.It's super stretchy (more so than a thermal blanket) and helps me make a nice, tight swaddle, even when I do a "sloppy" swaddle job in the dark at 3 a.m.I bought this blanket for my second baby along with some of the others.They are much more accurate than underarm or in the ear, although the gold standard is a rectal temperature, which can be upsetting to children.I actually wrote my Master's research paper on these thermometers, and here are a few tips in order to use them accurately:1. run the thermometer from forehead (above the eye) all the way into the hairline.It is always important to take the HIGHEST as it is most accurate.There is a chance it didn't read right on the artery so it wouldn't be as high, which is why it is best to do 3 readings.4.If your child is sweaty, the sweat dries off quickly and cools their skin temperature, so it isn't as accurate!Run the thermometer side to side, and not up and down.If you follow all of these steps, this thermometer is quick, easy and very accurate.I highly recommend it over any other form of temperature taking for young children.I wanted to try this becauce it is what they use at the doctor's office and it seems so easy and accurate.There is just one button!I tend to take two readings to assure an accurate reading, and my only gripe is that there is no "reset" button to use between readings.I was looking for a thermometer that would be accurate, and that the entire family could use.This works PERFECTLY.I've tried a couple different thermometers over the past few years - and they are always wildly off.This works fast and accurately every time!Thing thing WORKS!We've have had it since my son our an infant and he never really liked us poking around his nose, but it got the job done.Now he is a toddler it is the best thing ever.He understands what it does.The fat bulb part creates the perfect suction, then just the small top is inserted into the nose.Sometimes with the blue bulb's he'd move and it would get shoved up his nose which he didn't appropriate.I have only had the blue bulb and a worthless bulb that came with the red cross kit, so I don't have any experience with other "tools", but I like this so much I didn't see the need to get anything else.This is the BEST thing to get all the blockage from my baby's nose.I used to use the bulb and he HATED it and cried like mad.It's better than the graco one which i purchased to spare myself the suction, but i went back to using this one as it;s more effective.All aspirators work better if you use nasal saline solutions like physiomer, because they loosen all the yukkies in the nose first, but this one works great on its own.The tray for the bebepod is adjustable which is great for growing baby.The tray also comes with two adorable plastic placemats for easy clean-up.Plus, the bebepod is just cuter!!!This is the only item I have ever sent back.My 5 month old baby could not sit comfortably in it at all.And the refund was easy and hassle-free!Item came fast and was refunded very quick and easy.Thanks, but it wasn't for my son.We bought this for our son before he was born because we knew he would eventually need one and Babies R Us was having a great sale on it at the time.What I don't like about it is because of the texture, which is really smooth, when my baby sweats(which he does all the time becuase of his hot nature) his legs will stick to the chair when I try to get him out and also, he has VERY chunky legs, so when I try to pull him out I end up picking him up along with the seat still attached to his legs because the leg openings are a little small.It is very convenient because you can give sponge baths right in the changer at first.This was great for me because I had to have a c-section and giving a bath at the changing table meant I didn't have to bend or make any uncomfortable movements.I like that you can just wipe it down.I usually put a cloth diaper underneath him to prevent this.So, while you are not having to wash a changing pad cover very time, it doesn't save too much laundry.I have had this for almost one year.We bought this for our son and as boys are apt to do, we have had MANY many accidents on this changer.But true to its word, wipe it down with a wipe and you are done.Even for the more "explosive" of accidents the clean up is amazingly simple.I have bought this as shower gifts for two others and they love it just as well.So much easier than having to change pads and covers on traditional changers.It is by far the best thing we bought for our baby!Despite this, the high lip is still a highly recommended feature because it is solid and sturdy while being soft, so when my baby rolls over and tries to crawl away, he kind of doesn't because the lip makes him feel penned in.I'm not sure how long other parents have used changing tables for their babies...up to 2 years old?This changer, despite its great features, will not last that long, and we got bonus time with it because we had a preemie.I guess its the changing pad on the floor now...Still highly recommend over traditional changing pads.Urine and poop squirts that my horrible diapering skills fail to catch just wipe away.The Chai Tan color is more of a warm harvest gold color, and since our bedroom is harvest gold, sage green, and chocolate brown, it is a perfect match, and looks gorgeous and sophisticated on top of our mahogany antique dresser, which we are using as a changing table (much less expensive, better looking, and more useful after baby grows up).I don't know if it is the bright colors, or what, but my 13 month old son LOVES these spoons.Whenever he sees one he insists on carrying it around with him.However, the functionality is not so great for us.The bowl of the spoon is very soft and flexible, and since it is so deep it is sort of hard for him to scoop food into.He's still working on using a spoon effectively, so we usually end up trying different spoons for different food.I had bought these spoons last year for my oldest when she was learning to self feed.She never really took to these because the bowl of the spoon is very deep and hard for her to get the food out with her mouth by herself.However, I recently found that these soft, rubbery spoons make wonderful teethers, as my 10 mos old quickly discovered when I accidently dropped one on the floor one day.She will chew on the bowl of the spoon for quite some time -- it seems to bring her lots of relief, and she even prefers it over most of her traditional teething toys.I've had this now for almost a month and it has DEFINITELY saved the day, and probably my sanity.When folded up the potty is small enough to fit into my diaper bag and when in a pinch it's SOOOO much easier to set up the potty then have to try to run with a 2 1/2 year old to find a bathroom.It's super easy to set this up then run back and forth to a bathroom.It fits neatly into its plastic bag, and the plastic bag fits very easily with room to spare into our backpack (which we use instead of a diaper bag).My daughter likes her little "red potty".I purchased this potty to prepare for the next step in potty learning, attempting to go outside sans diaper.We aren't there yet but boy howdy what a multi-functioning potty.During potty learning, I know some folks like to have a mobile potty available in every room for their child.I wasn't keen on this idea.I grabbed it and opened it up and told her this was her special to go potty.She loved it and now we keep it in the bedroom for when she has to go during bedtime.The size is just right for us.It's not too big or small and is compact enough that we can slip it into our travel bag for trips to see family and friends.I love the bags that come with it.It's not as absorbent as a diaper but it does the job.I haven't tried this option yet but it seems sturdy enough.The easiest way to do this is flip the legs down and put the potty on the ground.Put your hands on top of the potty seat and apply pressure until you hear the clicking sound.2.This saves you from having to re-line it every time and the occasional, 'I'm not done yet!'We started potty learning early, mainly so that Mommy didn't have to use the bathroom with a baby on her lap.Because of such, we also have a backed Bjorn potty in the bathroom.We started using the portable potty at age 2.Hope this helps.My son adapted to it easily and never had any issues.I have twin toddlers and have several potties/seats at my house.I LOVE this little seat.It was the last one that I bought, but it is definitely worth the investment!For portable potties, I also own:Fisher-Price Potty On-the-GoGinsey Dora Folding Travel Potty SeatIf I had to pick one, the Potette 2-in-1 would probably be it - mainly for its versatility.I have girls, but the front/back of the potette seat has higher edges to act as a spray-shield.If you lock the legs properly, the seat is stable (at least for my 30 pounders).The Fisher Price potty is very hard to find, but you can find it online if you search (for a reasonable price).This potty is VERY stable and has a much larger seat.This potty comes with a really nice shoulder carry bag that includes pockets for "urine pads" and bags.The legs are super easy to pop in to place and to close.At first, I didn't think it was that great.My main complaint being the seat ring was far too big for a little hiney and my daughter's hiney kept falling INTO it.I really believe the ring/seat of this potty could have been made a little smaller (even an inch all around would make a difference), and then it would be absolutely perfect and even easier to tote around.Works great.For now, I just keep the potty in it's standing position in the van and since it's small enough, it's no big deal.I found that it fits in a drawstring backpack in it's standing position (even with the cut down bucket, lol), so we don't use the plastic carry bag it came with.I absolutely love this changing pad cover.It is very, very soft and fit very well and brown is a really good choice for obvious reasons :) It is really cozy and comfortable.Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still.The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.I recommend getting waterproof lap pads to put under baby's bottom otherwise you may be washing the cover more than you want (especially with newborns who will often continue their diaper destruction with the diaper off!).We also have the Ecru and are pleased with both colors.Love it!Super soft, looks great and fits changing pad perfectly!These changing pads are exactly as described.They are super soft, and wick away moisture easily.I also like the ecru color as it blends easily with any decor.For my first son I only used the terrycloth covers, but decided to try this out for my second son: I love them!They looks nice after being washed (on hot) and after going through the dryer (on medium heat) and they fit my 4-sided changing pad very well.This has been one of the few 'convenience' baby items that has really lived up to expectations.They do have a bit of a waxy feel to them, but we haven't tried our Crayola crayons on the mats yet to see if they are more or less compatible with them.I purchased this item to put in our camper.My child loved using this tub.They were absolutely true!!!My baby is starting to move around a lot and she has never slipped!I'm glad I bought this tub and didn't transition to adult tub from infant tub because she cried a little when i first put her in, but she got used to this tub fast.They are also the perfect size for a toddler's mouth.It surprises me how wide some of the other flatware out there is.This travel set is my favorite!Highly recommended!I bought this to keep in my diaper bag so I have child size silverware when we go somewhere.It can be used as a make shift rattle and my son loves to take the top on and off.She absolutely loves it!We started using at about 2 1/2-3 months.My baby has gagged on them numerous times.I got this cause my baby has cradle cap, it really works the brush is just the perfect size and strenght for a baby I was able to used it on the dry hair to loose the flakes first, worked great.I ended up going to buy one of these after my baby was born.Trying to swaddle with a blanket was too hard.I recently bought the larger size for my daughter now that she's grown out of the small.These swaddles are great because they keep the child secure.This is much easier to use than to try to swaddle with a regular receiving blanket.Our family loved getting these for Christmas!They were pretty easy to make, although we didn't like the cutters that they provided because they left the edges really ragged.We just formed our own little circles.Lightweight--I needed a stroller to take on the subway that I might actually be able to carry up and down the stairs if i had too.Our other stroller (City Mini) is fantastic but just too heavy for me to do that alone.2.Mesh sides.I wanted something that would be cool for summer since often I carry him in a Mei Tai but in the summer it just gets too hot.I planned on getting a universal seat liner for the winter to insulate hiis back a bit.3.Easily steerable with one hand.The reasons I ended up with the G Lite are1.BUT you can remove it and there is a full mesh only seat underneath, perfect for really hot days.Additionally the seat pad is included in the weight so the stroller only gets lighter if you remove it, while the Volo would just get heavier if you added one on.3.The basket is more accessible, though not quite as deep.6.I like that this can stand on it's own since our apartment isn't that big.8.It comes with a cup holder.9.The rain hood has a mesh panel in front of their face so you can flip the vinyl up there and some fresh air can get in.When it is only lightly raining I always debate about whether to use it or not.Since this sun hood really isn't water resistant it isn't really a debate with this stroller, but the lift up flap makes me feel like there is a little more ventilation going on in there.construction.The Uppa Baby seat wraps around the frame so it seems sturdier.13.Because the frame is structured so the babies weight is more toward the front of the stroller it doesn't seem to tip backward as easily.In our old Volo that was absolutely not true.I have an UppaBaby Vista for everyday and love it, so I got the G-Lite for shorter trips, mainly travel.I love how light it is, and easy to carry with the carry-strap.It's easy to fold and carry up and down stairs.It looks high-tech with its aluminum frame and bright colors.Also, thank you, Uppa, for adding a cupholder to this model.This stroller, however, sacrifices some features for its lightness.We should have thought more about the G-Luxe, but we figured we'd use the Vista for day-long journeys.Rather, when you travel and can't pack the Vista (or don't want to lug it in and out of the subway), the G-Luxe would have been a better choice.It was great, with its kickstand, to fold up on the subway.We are now looking at other umbrella strollers with recline, like the Mac Quest and Uppa G-Luxe for our travel stroller.We love this stroller.It is well worth the extra money.It is light, attractive, has a bit of storage, and folds easily.It has a great shoulder strap for carrying -- I carry it up and down 3 flights of stairs, daily, while I'm holding my one-year old and a diaper bag.Unlike the UPPAbaby vista, which we also have, this one has a foot lock that is easy to work.The harness is very easy to use.But to be fair, I dropped the stroller on its side (without the baby in it!)I highly recommend this stroller.This stroller is brilliant.It's ability to stand up on it's own when folded makes it easy to take to restaurants or sports games and put it aside.The net underneath is big enough to store a kids backpack and your purse.It's great for travel, goes anywhere easily.We also have a quinny, that while I love it, this one is so much better for everyday use.There's no cons for the stroller, I can't believe it's only $107!My 2-year-old son saw it, and loves it!So I may be buying a 2nd one for his little sister.Walking and subway are my primary form of transportation and my 1yr old son and I walk about one mile home together from daycare every evening so there is no way to avoid my son being out in some cold and windy weather.I've used the 212 Blanket every day for the last 3 months and I've been very happy with it.With the 212 Blanket my son is always warm no matter how cold or windy it is.It also does a great job of keeping him dry if there's light snow.If it's especially windy, I find my son will pull up the blanket to cover more of his face but most of the time we walk around and all you see is a little baby's face poking out of the stroller.I like that it's an adjustable size so I can keep him warmer by keeping it snug.After a lot of research, I chose this one because of the dual receivers and the rechargeable batteries.I love that the monitor and receivers plug in so I don't have to have a ton of batteries on hand.I keep one receiver down stairs and 1 in my bedroom.I can even hear my son breathing most times, which is great for an anxious mom!The voice activation is so cool, and they are so clear.I haven't had a chance to try it yet since it's winter here now, very cold and lots of snow.The rechargeable handsets are great!The dual hand set is fantastic because I don;t have to constantly carry it from bedroom to living room, although the snazzy belt clip works great!The problem is the reception.It remind me a lot of when I was a kid and we had rabbit ears on the TV.Mom & Dad would make us stand in weird positions holding them so they could see.I have used it with my twin boys since birth.It is very sensitive to sound which is perfect for hearing baby.I have dropped the monitor too many times to count and it still works perfect!!The sound quality is absolutely perfect as well...I can hear my baby turn over as well as when he sucks his pacifier!It works great!And the long range is amazing!We were even able to hear our baby whimper in her crib from our neighbor's, 3 houses away!We had the Orbit infant car seat system, but my son weighed 21 lbs, 4 oz.sure, it may be safe.NOTHING.-the only way i could rotate it was to climb into the backseat, grip both sides and pull with all my strength.for $320 it's a little cheaper, reclines, looks great and is top of the class safety.orbit, i love your infant system.i was your #1 fan.but you've got a loooong way to go on the toddler system as far as i'm concerned.Our family has all the other Obit Baby products and with this final addition to the collection, I see all the usual thoughtfulness of design and attention to detail.Our son is 14 months old, around 30" tall and 24 lbs and absolutely loves his new seat.We have installed it rear facing in the center seat (on the base) of our CRV.Though the seat is very tall, it allows for plenty of growth in the future and I can still see out the rear window just fine.Also, when installed on the base, our son gets a few extra inches of height and he loves to look out the window.I also want to point out that the rear installation on the base makes use of the anti-rebound feature of the base which is RARELY found in any car seat on the market in the US, though very common in Europe.The only other way to get this kind of protection is to use a tether strap and an anchor in the floor of the car, which most cars do not have.Britax is the only other manufacturer to address this in rear facing situations.I don't understand why people don't realize this when they purchase ANY seat, yet complain about the lack of forward facing/base coupling with the Orbit.We do not use this car seat on the stroller chassis on a regular basis but have this wonderful feature specifically in mind for when we are traveling, which we do frequently.Just wheel right up to the plane's doors and then carry the seat on the plane and strap it in.Almost all cars/taxis these days have the LATCH system so it takes about 30 seconds to get it in and out.This is what Orbit Baby had in mind, you obviously don't use it as your everyday stroller but as an bonus feature to the Obit list of features.Getting the straps properly adjusted was a cinch, they are on the lowest setting and I have moved the crotch strap forward one.Again, Orbit Baby has made this process very simple.All of the straps are neatly stored in the back side of the car seat, there is even a place for the sunshade and the manual as well as the extra installation straps for use without the base.I have no issue what so ever with the straps twisting.When I take my son out of the seat, we loosen the straps and then use the handy Velcro tabs to keep the straps out of the way.When I put him back in, the straps are out of the way and just waiting to be secured, piece of cake!UPDATE: 3/30/2012I am looking to by a second toddler seat as we are now on baby number two nearing the one-yea-old stage.I can't believe the difference in quality and how crappy it was compared to the Orbit.The Maxi Cosi Pria 70 is exactly the same as the Cosco Senerca which is a popular "extra" seat for under fifty bucks.Orbit has the highest tech in impact protection with the EPP foam.My only complaint, which I saw going into this deal, is that this thing is way too heavy and physically bulky to really function as part of a travel system.Sure you can remove it from your car and dock it to the Orbit stroller if you have it, but if you value your back, you're gonna want to securely tether this thing in a semi-permanent fashion to your backseat and never lift it again.Not to mention, once you're using it forward-facing (meaning you can no longer dock it to and from the Orbit Base), you can't really remove it all that easily.That's why Orbit has another option available for strolling, lighter and better for moving about.The pieces of plastic were so small and cheap-looking that I figured it can't be important.I examined it and there were no Right/Left labels, so I figured it didn't matter.Due to this, there is no way of getting it back into the box to return!We love it!I love the extra protection around my baby's head.Love the cushion around the straps.Love that the harness can be adjusted without rethreading.The stylish colors are a great plus too (we have tropical)!The newborn cushion is nice for catching the spit-up that seems to constantly pour forth from my sweet, adorable daughter, and it is easy to remove and wash (and holds up well in the washer and dryer).I decided on this car seat based on my own research and the input of another parent who uses it and likes it.Although it is bulky, it is very user friendly.The latch for the base and the SIP adjustment lever are very easy to use.The adjustable strap in front of the seat allows you to make certain that the child is very snug and safe.After showing them how to operate it they said it was cool and the doctor seat it was a great seat.Just read the directions.When our daughter was released from the hospital her doctor and nurse said that they wish more parents would have this brand and model of seat upon discharge.The tightness of the base is achieved by using the Latch system and the seat belt with the seat belt clamp.The latches for the system are more than just mere clamps found on cheaper seats.The latch system clamps on this model are similar to seat belt latches allowing for very easy installation and removal of the base.Our baby rests comfortably and safely in this seat and I am pleased with the purchase.I gives this seat my highest and strongest recommendation.I have since bought a Chicco Keyfit and have been very pleased.Now, it seems that Consumer Reports has other options (the Chicco KeyFit 30) that have the same (if not better) safety rating and MUCH better overall score (not to mention $100 cheaper...)My #1 complaint is that the belt is really hard to use...especially with a squirmy child who is not very happy about being strapped in...it takes forever to get the snaps into place.)...but she is pretty tall...We're ready for a convertible seat now.I may keep this one around as a spare for the next kid, but would not recommend it.This time around with my son we initially purchased an Evenflo Serenade 35 and were not happy with it so we searched around and found this carseat at Goore's.Also, I like the side-impact "wings" for the safety aspect but I do think they block some of my son's vision which sometimes frustrates him, even at 6 1/2 months old.I gladly put up with these minor inconveniences to have a safe carseat that is very easy to adjust and seems to be comfortable as well.I have owned a Combi infant seat and a Graco snugride in the past.I wanted to buy something new and stylish, and this is one of three that are compatible with my 2010 Uppababy Vista.Peg offered numerous stylish fabric varieties, and I was thankful for that.It felt like my Graco or Combi felt exactly when I decided to move my kids out of carriers and into toddler seats.For new parents, this is VERY VERY IMPORTANT!There are times you WILL have to carry the seat.I know its heavy because its reinforced, which is nice, but just not practical.So far we love the seat.It makes it tough get your hand under it to pick it up.It wakes up the baby randomly throughout the night now.i just pour in whatever amount of water ( i dont look at the water/direction chart) and the bottle heats up fine.i just make sure to shake the bottle after heating just incase of hot spots-no bottle warmer is perfect.the alarm for when it is done is not that loud-it nevers wakes my daughter up.You're better of adding a few more $$$ and getting a really good one, like Dr. Browns warmer, wich I should have done since I use that brand of bottles, etc.no worth even try, I got this one cause I love a few things of this brand, the bottle cooler wich is amazing I must say, the drying rack, the containers for powder formula on the go, the wipes warmer I think the best one, etc.When I first got it, I didn't think it was going to be a very good ink pad.The prints all turned out great and the ink was easy to clean off my son's skin.The ink ran out after 2 very hard to see footprints.If you're in the market for the perfect baby shower gift, look no further - this is hands-down the best present we received ...and I'm not not just saying that because my mother gave it to me.:)My son has loved this toy since he was about a month old.At first he enjoyed just being able to  hold it and shake it (the design is perfect for little fingers), then it helped him learn how to transfer things from hand-to-hand (since it's so easy to grip), and now he loves trying to chew on it (very hilariously, I might add - it's impossible).The Oball always keeps him occupied, and is easy to attach  to a stroller/car seat/high chair with a few links (not included) so the adults don't try to steal it.Important note: Product page states this toy is for 3 years+, but packaging confirms that it's fine for infants (0 months+).My 5 month old can easily grab this & for the time being loves to try & chew on it & pass it from hand to hand to get it to rattle.Our neighbor's son is a bit older & has started rolling & everytime he's over he rolls around trying to get it.This rattle is a wonderful idea.The ball itself is fabulous and the added rattles make it all the more fun without hindering the natural flexibility of the ball.My daughter loves shaking it and passing it from hand to hand.My 6 month old got an Oball rattle for Christmas and he loves it.It's light enough that if he bonks himself in the head with it, it doesn't hurt.We also got a mini version with tether for his stroller.Babies can grab it, squish it, chew on it, rattle it, roll it, look at it, hear it and just play with it in sooo many ways from the youngest age.An absolutely ideal toy for infants.I bought this for my 3 month old for christmas.Now he is a liitle over 4 months and he loves it!I keeps him pretty occupied.I love it.This toy is invaluable because it can be clipped with hoops, it's not easy to drop, and it's actually a great crib toy.I would highly recommend this toy to new parents!I have bought many rattles for his tiny hands and it was impossible to keep a grip on them.I found this Oball here on Amazon and when it arrived it became my sons instant favorite.Perfect little toy for his 5 month hands.They have been chewed, smashed and otherwise loved.My son was able to grasp this ball at 2 months and now at 5 months, still loves it.So easy for him to hold onto, so light he can't hurt himself when flinging it around his face, great rattle sound.It has been my son's favorite since he first got it at 4 months and now still at 9 months.It's easy to grab, it's soft (which got us through the period when he would inadvertently hit himself in the face with everything he grabbed), it makes a nice gentle rattling noise, and it bounces (convenient for when he is in an enclosed space and it can bounce back to him).Perhaps the ball will be more fun when they start crawling and can follow it as it rolls away.It confirms to safety standards ASTM F963-03.I would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't entertain enough.My older one loved his tummy time, so I was surprised when my younger one hated it.Hated it, that is, until I got this awesome tummy time master!!SO sweet!My son is 3 months and HATED tummy time!I was searching for something to catch his eye to help him enjoy it a bit more.I found this and was willing to try anything to help - plus this had a multi surface and multi age feature.The version advertised is not what you get.I can easily add my own teethers in front of the mirror but the discrepancy would make this item worth no more than $20.I'm sorry I paid $25 for it.I will be buying more of these blankets, for the price the quality is absolutely amazing.It is very soft, and adorable ;)Everything the reviewer "J. Lehman" was true.We bought my son this blanket when he was about 8 months.He loves it so much, we also bought him the green frog one also.I'm thinking about picking up a third one... it's that good!It has been working great for us during nights.This is a perfectly fine travel system.We did use the stroller around town and it is pretty nice, except the steering is really clunky.It seems pretty sturdy with no small parts.My 8 month old girl loves this thing!she loves frozen fruit in it.I bought a munchkin first but didnt find any replacement sets for it so it didnt work at all.Saw this nuby one and love it!But, it's a pain in the neck to open and close it.these bottles definitely seemed to help with my daughter's colic, but they drive us nuts.First, the measurements are tiny and extremely difficult to read - as are the nipple flow indicators.Boy, did I regret it.Most importantly, my daughter hated these bottles.Nonetheless, I switched to Avent.After all that work pumping, cleaning of those parts then cleaning and setting up of all these dr brown parts- the last bs I want to deal with is leaking!I do however, LOVE the warmer by dr brown.By the way, if you're baby has "COLIC" look into acid reflux.Does the baby arch his/her back and get fussy after meals or when you lay them down on their backs?Being a new/inexperienced mother I did not realize just how much of a difference the right bottle could make in preventing air in the tummy.My mother did research on colic and found reviews on these Dr. Browns Natural Flow bottles and thought it was worth a try.Still, these bottles have been a life saver and I would recommend them to any new parent as the FIRST CHOICE when their newborn arrives!As long as you use all the parts in the right way it does not leak and I just wish I would of bought this at the beginning.Great bottles!These bottles have raised numbers which DO NOT wash off.They work very well.But these bottles leak sometimes (even when not filled above the line indicated) and they have extra parts to wash. My baby seems to move back & forth fairly easily from this nipple to the breast.These are hands down the best bottles we've ever owned.I'll happily wash a few more bottle parts to save having to wash the baby, the floor, or myself (wherever his spit-ups land).We've been more than happy with them.My baby loved these bottles and the air system helped reduce the gas associated with bottles.Great bottles!I originally bought the variety starter and then as my baby grew past 3 months, I had to buy more of these 8oz ones.Because there are so many parts to clean, I wash a whole batch at a time.She was colicky for 5 months of her life.I'm not sure if these bottles helped or not but I have no complaints.Within a month with normal use 3 of the glass bottle had broken.That aside I must mention that I contacted the Handi Craft customer service via online form and within 1 business day I had a reply offering to replace the broken glass bottles with plastic ones (which is what I would have wanted given the tendency to breakage) and pay for postage to return the broken ones for quality control.My son has acid reflux issues and these bottles are great.Love them and Love the company.I got these when I had my baby, and I think they're wonderful!They are the most versatile and most used item that was bought new for the baby.The large size makes them multi-functional, and less of a gamble when picking her up when we're already dressed for work.I accidentally ordered the wrong spare parts kit.It's so great to have an extra set of parts.I bought this kit right away with an extra set of breastshields so I could have one set at work and one at home since I pump both places.This is a great item, that gives your child limited freedom.Great buy and nice alternative to the harness.Ours didn't have any funny taste.I purchased this set when my son was 5 months old- and he is now 14 months and I am still using them!I used these spoons for my son's first "solid" foods.Because the first foods are more liquid than solid, these spoons were so shallow they hardly held anything on it before it hit the baby's mouth.These won't last as long because they hold less food per spoonful than other deeper spoons.The lip is SO soft and rounded that when you use the spoon to catch dribble on the baby's chin/face, it actually just smears it or pushes it around rather than scooping it back up.(Buy the multicolored Munchkin spoons which are just as soft, will wipe food off the baby's face better, and hold more, thus lasting longer for when your child starts eating more volume and chunkier foods)I know that this spoon isn't made for baby to chew, but it has helped interested my baby  to feed him self and I can feel safe that it will not hurt him if he chews on it.Yes they were a good size for her mouth, and when she was just starting to eat solids @ 5 1/2 mos and was biting down I thought it was protecting her gums.I tried the NUK Gerber spoon I received during my baby shower, and she loved it.I'm really happy with this security blanket.Read the dimensions, this is NOT a full sized blanket, but is the perfect security blanket for baby girl.It washes well, and seems to be holding up ok.  Might even buy 1-2 more just to have for her.This blanket is TINY!I should have read the size deminsions!It's about the size of a burp cloth, maybe a little smaller than a small receiving blanket!I was expecting a decent size blanket, you can't even wrap a newborn up in this size blanket.Yes it's good quality but very small!This is the perfect size for little ones that love carrying blankets around plus it is very soft.so soft, holds up in the wash.  my baby loves it and so do I.We have a boy, and the color doesn't bother us, but online it looks like it's all blue.This is a wonderful swing...Baby loves it and he's comfortable enough to take a nap in it.It's very cute as well and the materials used are very soft and cuddly.I have done lots of research before purchasing this one and I don't regret the choice.The price was very nice too.It calms her right down by simulating the womb with the position of the seat and the swinging.Add a pacifier and it really helps calm her down.He prefers the back to front motion instead of side to side.In retrospect, I wish I knew that because I would have purchased the Zen instead.2) The swing only has a reclined setting on the seat.I purchased the My Little Lamb model for my newborn.It is a large swing and won't be moved around the house so it would be very practical to be able to plug it in rather than having to keep replacing batteries.All in all, I love the swing and so does my baby.Since she was swaddled we found it built in a way that it was safe not to have to strap her in.We never really used it in the upright position with the tray.That was especially nice when you were trying to keep the sun out of her eyes.My friend has one of the newer models with the butterflies and it now comes with a plug.That would have been nice.Our son loved this swing!He was happy in it for long periods of time.It was super cozy and so easy to put together- I did it myself in less than 30 minutes.The speeds were perfect, the music was nice, and the mobile was ideal especially as he got older.We bought rechargeable batteries by Sanyo and these were essential.I highly recommend this to new parents- you won't be sorry!I had a different version/model of this swing with my first son that i borrowed from a friend and loved it.They seemed very nonchalant about the whole thing.My husband and I purchased this for our first daughter.However, it made terrible clicking and humming noises.We have not used the swing yet, but it seems to be very sturdy.Set up was easy and it looks great.Seems like a good model overall.I bought this toy for my son at around age 7 months.Depending on his mood, he will bang a key, kick the piano off his lap, or just spin the roller endlessly.The toy has pleasant music that both my husband and I find ourselves humming throughout the day!This toy was recommended by a physical therapist for tummy time.My son loves it.This little toy piano is a great toy... the "piano" function is fun, the foreign languages are cool but over my baby's head at this point, and I like the way that it can also play real music (much to baby's bafflement).This is great for babies who are too little for a real glockenspiel toy--too young for motor coordination.I wish that it had a full scale--its impossible to play most simple tunes--but it is a solid start for letting babies make music!It has been his incentive to start rolling over more.It is very cute and I love how it has the pad in it so baby doesn't slip and the toy it comes with works good as a toy for baby and as a way to pour water on baby.Love it.This tub has been great, up until now.Other than that, this has been great, my son lights up when he sees it.This tub is great.I love this tub and my daughter seems to think it's her own little spa!It was very easy to put together, has nice hand grips on the sides for easy lifting and it works great even for a small baby who can't quite hold their head up yet.The little whale scoop is adorable and fun to use.Instead I set it on the counter.It hasn't been a problem or anything, but it would just be an additional plus if the legs had less risk of moving.I do understand countertop use wasn't in the primary design, though.Overall, I love this tub and so does the little one.Overall it is a great tub and I would recommend it to friends.My son loves splashing around in this tub every night.Makes bath time fun for both of us!nice tub .i gifted it to my friend for baby shower she loved it,said that their baby enjoyed bathing in it.I received this infant tub at my baby shower and I love it!I have been using it for 6 months now and the tub has held up beautifully.The green foam and the removable insert truly keeps the baby from sliding down into the water (plus those features allow me to use both hands to bath my son unlike other tubs where you have to hold the baby with one hand/arm).This tub is worth every penny!CONS:- The green bump needs to be taken out so the tub can be cleaned as it collects toe jam and mold underneath.It is also a pain to remove (the trick is to pull apart the sides of the tub so it releases.Also, once your child is older and you remove the bump, the holes it snapped into are exposed.In this price range, I think the tub is a great choice.Though, the Cleanwater tub looks rather small, I think my son would have outgrown it a lot sooner (which is ultimately why I chose the whale tub!)I bought this for my brother for his baby shower.This was our son's first bath tub and we are still using it at 8 months.We stuck it on the counter in our bathroom and because it wasn't as large as some of the other tubs, it was workable.3-5 MONTHS:Before our son could sit up on his own this was the PERFECT time for this tub.The angle of the tub back was perfect so he didn't get water in his ears but we could fill the tub up to keep him warm.We still put a warm washcloth on his chest in the winter to keep him from getting chilled, but in a warm bathroom this wasn't necessary as their was enough water in the tub.6+ MONTHS:Now that he can sit up on his own, we took the green butt-bumper out and he can sit comfortably in the deep end of the pool facing either front or back.This is the best baby tub ever.My hands are free and I don't need to hold her up at all to bathe her in here -- it's simply perfect.It worked since birth and she absolutely loves it.We bought this for our son for those times when a potty is not close.This seat is very sturdy, easy to clean up, and folds fairly compact.I would definately purchase this seat again.not to big ot small).Would recommend this to a friend, that's how I knew about it in the first place.After reading the reviews I was a bit worried about ordering since people were saying the seat was too small and the overall size was too big...however it is much better than I expected and I am very pleased!The side pockets are great at holding extra bags,clothes and wipes.I find the overall size is still quite small, and we can easily fit it in the stroller, it is light weight to carry as well.I find that the seat size may be a bit bigger than what we were using and it actually seems more comfortable for my son.Opens easily.The other has a spare outfit.... just in case.My only complaint--- it would be great to have a pee guard in the front.We have this sponge for our baby and thought it would be good for sponge baths in the first few weeks but he hated it.I ended up ditching the cushion and folding up a big beach towel, it seemed more comfortable for him.The cushion also wasn't very long, our son was 20 inches when he was born and was already a bit to big for it.This works great, as I said, for the way I use it.If your looking for a very thick foam pad then this isn't the one for you.Needed a booster for my 4 year old cause a full front facing seat was getting a little awkward for her to be in.This one is comfortable, easy for her to get in and out of too.It has kept my two tiny babies warm in their carseats during outings, winter walks, etc.It fits perfectly in the chicco keyfit carseat, and looks stylish to boot!Highly recommended for winter babies.I've been using the JJ Cole Bundleme for around a month now and I have to say that it works perfectly.The Bundleme is very easy to install as it separates in 2 pieces: Just open the 2 zippers all the way to the bottom and then remove the top cover, then you are able to easily install the bottom part of it on the car seat.The bottom part has multiple slots for different seat belt adjustments depending on your kid's size, so it is a breeze to install.Baby is warm and comfortable!The quality of this item is very good, and the variety in colors gives you a lot of options to combine with your car seat or stroller; mine looks as it all came together!;-) Highly recommended!I cannot say enough about how terrific this is for winter travel.We live in Florida and traveled to colder climate for the Christmas holiday.He was totally happy and slept right through trips from the warm car to the house without being woken up from the dramatic drop in temperature.Our son was born in March in a city that snows into the "summer" months.I should have taken these back to Target the day I bought them but I thought "Oh, they'll get better when I get more used to them."And as others have mentioned, be sure the spacing works for your cabinet knobs...My baby is too young to eat off of a plate, without her trying to throw the plate on the floor.These are very easy to install.Color blends in well with the outlet.3.You have to be a master at "Twister - the Hand Version" to get these off.My child quickly figured out how to remove these outlet covers.This grinder does not grind meat worth a flip.It seems to work ok on fruits and pasta and softer foods that don't have fibers like meat.I have used it in a pinch for soft foods and it does make a good size grind.I love this mobile, and so does my son.It plays 4 different songs and the remote control is great.I received that part within a week, but still no movement!But, my two month old loved the mobile once we installed it on his crib.We are happy with the end result and were pleased with the response of customer service, I just wish the replacement parts had arrived a little sooner or it would have worked the first time.Our baby loves this mobile.This is a great addition to the nursery and I am so glad we have it!this is a very pretty mobile with good music that my daughter seems to love, however, after a month it started making this whirring sound when ever a song is played.It seems to me that "Tiny Love" has quality control issues.Baby ignored it during the first month, but then slowly started tracing the moving toys with his eyes and at 3 months coos and laughs every time I turn it on.Absolutely wonderful!Note however, that it is stimulating  - I wouldn't use it if I wanted to put baby to sleep.Other positives:1. music is pleasant; listening to it several times a day for a couple of months, I am still not sick of it.2.She can lie there with attentive eyes for quite a while (30-45 minutes) which is a LOT longer than she'll look at anything else.5 Stars--highly recommended.It seemed more entertaining and engaging than most other mobiles.The colors are vibrant and the music is nice as well.It is a great way to keep him occupied for 10-20 minutes while I am in the shower or doing laundry.I love that you can easily remove and replace the mobile part without having to take off the base.The music is pleasant too.I am sad that we will have to take the toy down soon since it is only for use through 5-months.I will probably keep it up as long as she is awake and I am around since she is starting to try to touch the animals, she just loves it so much!I fell in love with this mobile because of the colors and theme.I might end up returning it unless I figure out a way to safely use it somehow.This would be such a shame since I think its absolutely adorable and would hate to have to return it.This is a really nice "baby soother" since it has various music choices and a very nice rythmic movement.The music lasts for quite a while before stopping and has a remote control as well in case you want to restart it from a distance.And we managed to get it to attach to the Graco Pack 'n Play as well!We typically turn the mobile on, but without the music going.I was bummed and tried to call Tiny Love and the number that I tried first didn't work (of course this got me more upset).Then I went online to their website and tried to fill out a replacement part form and it said to call if it was a baby mobile.Finally I found another number on the box that worked and I called them and the lady told me to forward my amazon.com confirmation email to them and that she would send me the replacement part in 7-10 business days.I like the characters, the colors, the way they move and the music.My daughter loves this mobile.I bought it sight unseen based on the amazon reviews and we have been so happy that we chose this one.She loves watching them.My friend concidentally bought the same one and she raves about hers also.I didn't get an extra snack trap lid or a "sippy cup" lid to go with it.I do love the Snack Traps - we own 4 of this brand and 1 munchkin.We prefer these ones which are smaller and easier for our little one to grip.With both she's figured out how to dump everything out of them pretty good, but c'est la vie.I received this as a baby shower gift and tried to use it several times.Well, we decided to give it another shot.We used the hotsling for the first 3 months of my baby's life and then we bought the Balboa after she outgrew the hotsling.The fabric color is nice, neutral and the embroidery is quite chic.* Once you find the correct size adjustment for yourself, it's very easy to use.)* It cannot be used for very long walks as, even though it's comfortable for quite a while, it's not all that back friendly!I am sure every kid is different but that does not allow me to use it while seating in a restaurant for example.I would definitely recommend this purchase to new parents.I also have a Baby Bjorn, but I love this one for around the house for my own comfort.We just started to face him forward in this while I eat, it helps support him on my lap until he's big enough for a booster seat.I like the ease of getting her in and out of it compared to wraps.This sling has a deep pouch that is not adjustable making it very difficult to correctly position a newborn or small baby.These cheaper slings look inviting and some look easier to use, but they are dangerous and uncomfortable!I agree with another poster that it is magic.I put her in it and she calms INSTANTLY.She's as happy as a little lark in that thing!Easy to transport, easy to use.It was just not safe.She does ride forward but can easily turn to the side and see, she can also ride on the hip.When she gets bigger I can use it as a backpack and carry her on my back up to 40lbs.So I can't speak to how well that one works for small infants.I bought my first set at a big box store and loved them.I thought I would buy some replacements online from amazon.The older version has an "X" on the silicone top to prevent too much vacuum/suction from building up.This new model has a round valve in it's place, and it doesn't work at all to prevent too much of a vacuum from the suction building up in the cup.Not loving these, and will have to hunt for the older model.These are the first sippy cups that have worked out well for my son.So, I would have to take the stopper out for him to drink from it, which always led to a mess.I haven't had any issues with the nipples on the cups, and we've only had very minor spills/leaks with the cups, which have usually come from my son biting the spout.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cup is so large that my son can't hold it on his own (he's 11 months now).It is much better for older babies, not as a transition cup.Otherwise, I think it is a great cup.It doesn't leak at all and there are only two parts to clean in the dishwasher, which is so nice.It is very sturdy!My son loves to roll and roll when you are changing him or after his bath.I looks great.The drawers are solid.There were some scraps on the pieces when coming out of the box, but the pen provided covered them up very well, or they were hidden after construction.It is pretty easy to put together...all it involves is slipping the foam pieces into the covers the correct way.I love the simplicity, functionality, and innovative design of this crib bumper.The thing I don't like about this crib bumper is the price!For some foam pieces and fabric, it's a little pricey but you might be able to find them on sale as I did.We bought this when my son started rolling around in the crib alot and banging his head on the sides (about 7 months).We haven't heard him smack his little head against the rails since we installed it, and we feel so much better.It ties onto the crib sides, and it is GREAT at keeping his pacifiers in the crib at night.I have bought other items for the nursery and had no problems because of the variety of colors in this bedding set.The bedding set looks even better in person, the colors are so rich and the fabric is super soft.I have washed the set many times and it has held up beautifully.This set feels and looks fantastic.I am really impressed at the quality and detail that you get for the price.I bought this for my then 4-mo.He had already been long fascinated with blankets and pulling them over his face or trying to chew them.In actuality, he didn't play with it to teeth on but he did like the crinkly texture of the star and the noises.It was a little bigger in size than I expected which was cool - it made it more floppy and interesting for him.It's got a fun squeaky noise (in the red), the yellow is terry cloth so it absorbs the drool, the dark blue is rubber that she loves to chew and the other tips of the star offer fun noises and different texture.And it folds up nicely into her diaper bag.A great toy for my baby!(I bought it when is was 4 months old and she uses it almost every day - she is now almost 6 months)Surprisingly, most of the combs that are included in sets for babies that I've tried have sharp teeth.The comb teeth are rounded and flexible, so it should be gentle enough for even the youngest infants.And the brush is very soft as well.I like the shape of it, which gives you a good grip - it's designed so that you can hold the back of the brush firmly, not just by the handle.All in all, this is a perfect set that does exactly what I need it to do.I'm very happy I found it.My only wish is that it would be great if they sold the comb separately.I bought this tooth brush kit and really don't use it.The finger brush is ok. My son did enjoy chewing on the other two items when he was teething.I still use the toothbrush stand even now that I bought a new better toothbrush, but everything else hit the trash.I've owned 4 of these brushes.The first 2 were when my son was born, and then the next 2 were for my twins.I LOVED how it was so easy to spin the brush in the bottle for cleaning, and the sponge at the bottom was a fabulous tool for getting the bottle really clean.It also does not work for cleaning small part of any breast pump accessories, because that further destroys the sponge and the brush part is actually very easy to bend - and then break.I bought it when my twins were born hoping that Evenflo had redesigned it and it was going to be a fabulous cleaning tool.But as it is, I'm afraid it's not worth it.These are great, I have used these on my baby daughter since she was born (she is now 10 mos.)The design makes it easy to hold and to safely trim nails without clipping too much or snipping the skin.Everywhere else they are part of the kit (which I didn't need) so finding them online on amazon saved me alot of time searching and money.My son has been teething and loves to chew on fabric.He absolutely loves his hippo blankie.It's also incredibly soft, totally adorable, and easy to wash. A must have for a little one!She's a tall baby so I liked that this was big enough for a 2 year old.I would have rated it a five, but I wish it didn't have tags on it and the info was sewn on.I gave this mat 5 stars for that reason because I feel safe letting her get a little wild in the tub and she definitely has developed a lot of confidence and feels safe enough to dance in the water and have a great time and is no longer feeling unsteady.Well we just moved and this matt worked well with our old bathtub- but at our new home it does not stick to our tub at all and just floats up.I'm not sure why- but it won work now-So while it worked it was great, but now I cannot use it.So its 50/50 rather it will work for you.My son enjoys these - I think they'll be around for a while.I like that they are perfectly sized for little hands and rounded so has not to be dangerous in any way.My infant daughter used this occasionally while teething but didn't love it.This toy is smaller than it looks, but is the perfect size.My son chews on this all the time.Our son loved this toy, mostly to throw around his pen.Is a nice squishy material and easily cleanable.Get theMunchkin Twisty Teether Ball, Colors May Varyinstead.It's got better textures on the teething nubs and is colorful and rattles, so your baby might actually be interested in it.I would have to hold this in my son's mouth for him to chew on it and he showed no interest in it otherwise.Love these bottles!My daughter throws these on the floor constantly and they never break because of the silicone shield.These are high quality bottles, worth the extra cost.Borosilicate glass is a stronger glass making process that is less likely to break and resistant to thermal shock.So yes READ MORE AT [...]However, it seems to be pretty great.We still really like it, but I did want to mention that the seam along the pocket on the front flap tore pretty early on, so I can't really use that pocket because items fall out.I use it much more than the fancier, more feminine diaper bag that I bought for myself.It's a great color (true to picture) and has some very nifty features, with the wipes case on the front being one of the handiest.It also has stroller clips which we use constantly and the 2 side pockets for bottles (we use them for sippy cups) are fantastic and have easy access from the exterior.The inside is super roomy and has plenty of pockets for organizing.I also like the zipped pocket on the front for quick and easy access and I didn't realize until recently but there are also two slim zippered pockets on the front panel on either side of the wipes.I'd really recommend it for long outings and for your man to carry.These are great.Some of them have rubber for teething and others have textures for babies to enjoy.These are my favorite links, because you get lots of links for the price.The different textures provide lots of choices for teething, and the links are the right size to fit all the toys with loops that I have tried.Their oval shape means that they don't separate very easily.There are some unusual colors so it makes a wonderful expansion set if you already have other links.Great choice!I received these link as part of a baby gift.I thought it was so unique and had never seen them sold before.They come in a wide range of colors and textures.My babies sometimes enjoy just chewing on them rather than their toys.Great gift idea to throw in with a basket of items.These are great, cheap and useful.The options for these links are infinite.I love this blanket it is one of my favorite baby blankets,Actually I was hesitant aa whether it qaa worth it to purchase this or not because it is expensive, but after receiving it I couldn't be happier.It holds up wonderfully after several washes with no fading or shrinking.Actually I have all three versions of Aden and anais blankets, their swaddle, the double layer and this one the dream, and they are all wonderful, I feel like j have blankets for al weather and all occasions.I got the orange blankie...waited and waited (because it's expensive) but, splurged and got it...ohhhhhhh, it's amazing!!Thick, soft, warm, color is great...might keep for myself!!Absolutely love it!!(Going to splurge again..)  Would also make the perfect shower gift!!This blanket is such a great size, so soft and such high quality.The print is so cute and my son loves it.I especially like how this blanket is not too warm in the summer months and perfect in the winters.This is also a great blanket for tummy time and outdoors, don't worry about getting it dirty or staining because it washes so well.I like finally having a decent clip for our soothie pacifiers, but the cord rubbed against his skin and left a slight red mark after only a short period of time.I bought this booginhead as my MAM pacifier straps were useless.Unfortunately the booginhead and MAM pacifier dont work comfortably (at least for my son) together so I used the plastic circular piece from the MAM strap system and attached it to the loop on the BooginHead.NOW it is a perfect strap!It's perfect for the carseat and stroller.Such a simple idea but a great one!I wished I had purchased this sooner...Not anymore!!!!!I was a little hesitant to spend extra money on a strap when I wasn't sure it would hold up against my daughter - but this was definitely worth it!I bought this for my new daughter and it is great, super cute colors(pink and green stripes) , plus it really does work with all different paci's.Washes and dries quickly.I only have 2, one the clip is easy to use and the other clipping and unclipping it is a little stiffer.We were given a different one that has a velcro attachment for paci's with a ring type grip, but for soothies, this is the perfect holder (the only one I've found that holds soothie pacifiers).I love it, the price is reasonable, and the designs are adorable.I have the blue bubble design, and it's super cute.I have a little girl, but the blue bubble design is great for either boy or girl!It has held up well for the three months we've been using it since my son was born.I bought this paci holder because my son loves the Soothie pacifiers, and this is one of the only holders that will attach to that one.It's a piece of ribbon attached to a clip.I got a bink link off of amazon.com and at least it's got some style for the price.These work the best for soothies out of anything else I have found.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!I bought this and i am very pleased with it.It's a wonderful color and a change from the usual clip on chains, but i think it's a bit short.Super well made, attaches to pretty much ANY binky (i use gerber natural flex--my fav), looks super cute, and the ribbon is a good length (not too long) for baby.I want to order a few more in different colors!Our son loves to spit out his nookie.We bought a few of these, and they have saved us countless trips to bathrooms to wash nookies.We'd happily recommend this to anyone with a baby prone to losing their nookies!It works well, I don't need to worry about the pacifier to fall down anymore!Easy to attach to baby's cloth and won't hurt the baby.I think these are overpriced for what they, but they do the job very well.Oh well, I'm still glad I got it because she loves chewing on the strap.The clip is quite secure and the ribbon is not too long where it might be a choking hazard.I bought this bed for our daughter.The drawer was a different color and there was pencil writing on it (not sure why - other than that it seems brand new.)Overall im pleased with this purchase.Also, I watched the price for it and was able to get the natural color for about $66.00!I restarted it the next day, and it lasted for just a couple of hours.That's right... it didn't even last 2 days.Real nice.It makes for less resistance from her.I had read the reviews for all the other Potty Watch colors and they all seemed to indicate that the quality control was really a hit or miss.I was hoping to be one of the lucky people that received a working potty watch.I returned it with no incident, but by the time, a new one would have arrived my daughter was already potty trained on her own.Obviously, you could use a timer to remind yourself, but I think the kids would enjoy a song.When we were out in the city the watch mainly served as a visual reminder to keep him on schedule versus ever hearing the alarm.But it works fine and if you cannot otherwise keep to a schedule fork out the $10-15 and move on.Just don't expect to pass it down through the generations, you'll be lucky if it can last until your next child needs it.However, even washing them in the washer did not work out well for us.I usually put underwear underneath these pants but they still manage to leak through with just one accident.The Gerber Brand Waterproof PEVA Pants can be compared to a shower cap for your kid's training pants.After seeing how uncomfortable these pants made our son feel even when he was keeping his pants dry, I just couldn't leave him in them.The pants do not allow for your kid's skin to "breathe" and because the air flow is not really great, it made him feel wet simply because he was sweaty!Not recommended.The gerber cloth 18month undies fit her perfect, and I figured these would go with them - nope!I'm torn on this item.My son loves this toy.I don't find the spikes to be sharp either.WOW, this is a great necklace.It is so great that I bought 3 of them in different colors so I would always have one around to wear.Our daughter started teething at 4 months and had 2 teeth out and fully functional before her 6 month birthday, so we had  lot of chewing right out of the babygate.These necklaces look like stone or jade rings, but have the perfect semi-soft texture that is great for teething babes.Before I found these, I had a goofy looking teething ring I'd wear on my wrist; I am not a vanity hound, but since there are days I am under-slept and/or don't get to wash my hair -- it is nice to wear something pretty.This would make a wonderful shower gift, or gift to aunties and grandmas.My wife bought two of these to where while our daughter is still teething so that she can still where some jewelry and not have to worry about it getting ripped off or destroyed.I do too because it's simple.It's something she can play with quietly and safely and can also take places.He hated them ALL he would gag and have not have anything to do with them.This natursutten paci is FANTASTIC!The only paci my son would suck on, Never once gagged on this binky.He still is getting used to it, has a hard time keeping in his mouth but Im so happy I finally found one that he could suck on without that full body gag.The Plus side is this is all natural Rubber, Very easy to clean since it is all 1 piece.Baby likes the extra large face shieldI bought this hoping that my newborn baby would like it as much or more than his Soothie pacifier.I bought the round one because my son is exclusively breastfed, but he spits it out and fusses each time I try.I bought these pacifiers before baby was born and had them ready for him.I would say that it is worthwhile to try, but your baby may have a strong preference for the one from the hospital or for another style.It's really up to them and we can't force much on them!She SOMETIMES would take the soothie, but it was always a fight.This one is latex style closer to an actual nipple texture.The sweet sound of quiet.I wish people wouldn't post something they don't know anything (or very little) about.First, these are perfectly safe for babies with a latex allergy.The process by which the binky is made removes the latex.It's nice to know even if it is a latex allergy his binky isn't contributing.Secondly, if your binky gets a white reside it's because it's water logged.You need to do this the old fashioned way.She also used binkies like this for my baby brother 12ish years ago.My son LOVES these binkies.I finally have some peace.I love these.I've nursed all my boys and find this style to soothe better.My baby won't suck on pacifiers much, mostly just chews on them.But he will occasionally suck on this one, and when chewing, enjoys chewing around the whole thing since it's all squishy.Loved the idea of all natural rubber but my son hated this orthodontic paci.I did however get him to use the rounded version of this pacifier, I suggest if your little one doesnt like the orthodontic paci that you give the rounded version a tryI was intrigued by this paci since the first time I saw it.I hesitated b/c it costs more than others, but put it on our wishlist and received it for Christmas.My son LOVES this paci.I like it b/c it doesn't hold water after washing, it's easy to clean, it's VERY soft (breast-like) and he likes to chew on the outer edges of it when he's done sucking on it too.I love them!My daughter doesn't naturally take to any pacifier, so we had to encourage them for a few days.Now she loves them too.I was a size 18 at the time.It's also easier to grasp the extra strap to adjust when I switch from back to front carries.I actually ended up using these on myself because the baby likes our rubber finger brush & flavored toothpaste better.I have had this cup for over a year and it is still good as new.Comes in real handy for getting your stubborn child to switch to the cup.This cup is great.It does leak a tiny bit.I do recommend this highly.I love it.Love the colors and durability.My 6 month old son loves this toy!It is quaint, sturdy and beautifully made.Stacking and nesting bowls teach babies many important motor skills, really an important toy.I am very happy with my purchase.i used this seat rear facing for months and then forward facing for years, and i love it.it is awesomely comfortable for the kids, they nap wonderfully in their seats.the seats wash up well too, very important!i am going to continue to use this seat for another year at least with my older 3 year 40lbs boy, it is safer than a booster.We've had this seat about 6 months now, installed in a 2009 CR-V, and we love it.One quirk:  when it was rear-facing it was tough to get the harness straps tight.We ended up applying common sense and using one center LATCH bar and one side LATCH bar, giving it a slightly wider anchor base, and the seat is now ROCK solid.I also think the harness pads (which the Marathon doesn't have) are invaluable.I think the straps could be really uncomfortable without the pads.I love this carseat's safety record, and really when it comes to carseats I guess that's all that really matters.Other than that, no complaints!When the box arrived I thought that it was going to be huge.I like the versatility to be able to have it both forward and backwards facing.Recently bought a Graco Nautilus 3-1 for the grandparents which was more reasonably priced and just as good of quality.The Nautilus has a nice cup holder on it which makes it easier for snacks/drinks during long trips.This item cost me $10.00 I wish I would have been able to try it before buying it.Previously, she would tilt her head back to let me wash her hair, but she hated the feeling of water in her ears and would freak if it touched her face.Out of desperation we sought out a new solution.She loved it from the first try.Why only a four star review for such a success story?Not ideal, but I'd take the extra rinsing over the meltdowns any day.My wife and I use this guard 2-3 times per week--every time we bathe our 9-month-old son.However, do not expect miracles.Your baby will be interested to know what the heck you are putting on his/her head, but we have found that distracting our son with a bath toy while holding this guard in place works pretty good.For us, this is definitely a 2-person task.In any event, we could not live without it, and you will likely not be disappointed if you give it a shot.It works perfectly, keeping all of the water off of her face and out of her eyes and ears.My daughter isn't afraid to get in the bath anymore.It costs a bit more than I wanted to pay, but it's worth it.He hated having water in his face, but he felt uncomfortable laying down or leaning back.As many other people have done before, we were ready to move on from the huge car seat/stroller combo and get a more compact set of baby wheels with some style.After considering the Peg Perego P3 Pliko (USED mind you wow $$$), the 3 wheeling Jeep, the Kolcraft Contours 4 wheeler (this came in very close second but only comes in orange and my husband vetoed that color outright) and the Gogo Babyz Urban I found myself going back to this one over and over.Finally we hit a store that carried it to give it a spin.Our (awesome) Graco system takes up the entire trunk area of the station wagon.The seat doesn't let your kid slouch and is well padded but solid firmness for back support.Just buckle her in then swivel them to the correct position- no twisted straps.Our girl normally hates 5 point harnesses but was cozy and happy from the first.The recline really is superb.Canopy, sun visor, however you label it.One of the only strollers I've come across that actually has one worth having!The peekaboo window is also a respectable size and rolls up and secures with a toggle loop.The cool part is, you can unvelcro the hood and rotate it to cover the front of the baby.If you bought a dark one like me (we wanted one that hid dirt well, it is for long term use, there WILL be stains) these will really help with visibility at night.Storage: The zip compartment on back is perfect for keeping sunblock, neosporin, band-aids, keys, wallet, etc... anything you want to have stay with the stroller and secure.A nice additional touch I've also never seen on any stroller are the mesh pockets in the CHILD area for them to store a favorite toy, snack, etc... and be able to access it themselves.It has 3 heights for the shoulder straps, once again something to make sure it grows with your child.It goes up to 50 pounds.While I find the quality worth it, some may not.The brakes are not for bare toes, they are sturdy and not meant to be lightly undone.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So our final opinion is: Awesome stroller!The color choices give wide options (I hate how many strollers have like one or two choices and if you love the stroller just hope you can deal with the patterns)The overall look is really nice.It also passed rigorous safety testing.A+ in my book.I hope this helps, and if it isn't the right one for you, I wish you the best on the great stroller search.Gotta love our babies!This is an AMAZING stroller right out of the box.Love the canopy - it shades EVERY part of the toddlers body.Also love the pockets for mom and the inside pockets for baby to stash toys and a cup in, never seen this feature before in a stroller.This is the perfect solution - maneuverable enough for light jogging, has more storage than an umbrella stroller, but still very light.I have a giant backpack I use for a diaper bag, but I can distribute my items in the basket and the 2 panniers quite handily.I have a 18 month old and I recently set out to find a "perfect stroller" for him.I compared several models including peg perego si, baby jogger city mini, valco baby ion, and zopper twist and zooper waltz.I recently travel with my son with a zooper twist stroller.Joovy, please check out how the baby jogger city elite figures out how to make the footrest adjustable on this type of stroller frameHope this helps.I have the red one.My baby is almost 7 months old, about 8.5 kg and about 65cm tall.Read alot of reviews, compared alot of strollers ( uppa gluxe, city mini, colcraft, jeep...) It's my first stroller, so here's my thought.It's looks nice, is sturdy, the reclinemechanism is very simple and very easy with one hand(up and down), it's easy to fold (3 steps, 4 if you fasten it)I tried it with bare feet, and it was ok, so flipflops should be too.I have a tile floor, the turning radius is small...actually you can stand in one place and rotate the stroller( even with one hand).Luckily she can't get up from the chair and when I'm pushing the stroller she leans back... but I wouldn't trust the sholderstraps of keeping her upperbody in place, if the seat is all the way upright and lets say I would accidently bump into a stop suddenly while walking a good pase with the stroller.Think I made the right choiceHi Again.My girl is now 9 months old.I am happy with absolutely everything about this stroller except that it's difficult to drag or bounce up and down stairs because the brakes are on the backs of the wheels.That said, the person whose review is most important loves this stroller and that's my son.In the Joovy Kooper he is very comfortable and well supported and never fusses being put into it or riding in it.I got the yellow in the Joovy Kooper and he loves the color.It makes me feel much more visible therefore more safe crossing the road pushing the stroller, between the bright color and the reflective fabric used on the logo and in stripes on the straps and on back of the stroller.I am 5'7" tall and my husband is 5'11" tall.The basket underneath dismayed me when the stroller first arrived but on my first market trip with the stroller I saw the basket fits a lot more than you'd think.After reading so many positive reviews on this site, I bought the Joovy Kooper (in Appletree color).I'm 5'6" and when I pushed it, my shin would kick into the big red button in the middle (this is the button you step on to open the stroller).I'm not sure why anyone would think this stroller is great for tall people.* WHEELS LOCK UPThe front wheels lock up.And yes, I DID check to make sure they weren't inadvertantly locked (they weren't).Three wheels would spin, one wouldn't - so it was impossible to steer with a 25 lb kid in it.This is the main reason for the return, I can't see this stroller lasting for three years, until my son is out of strollers.* 5 POINT HARNESS STINKSWhile I think the reflectors on the shoulder stap covers look cool, they prevent the straps from being tightened properly, so my son would shrug out of the straps altogether.This is particularly a concern because there is no tray/bar for the lap, so your kid will fall out.* CANOPY ISN'T ALL IT'S CRACKED UP TO BEThe canopy IS large.Not such a huge deal, except that my son is a year old and he can't sit back because the canopy is so huge when folded back, that he can't see out.If he grew another few inches, I'd have to remove the canopy altogether, because it would be wrapped around his head, like a big floppy hat.It takes up considerably less space in my trunk (I have a Toyota Camry) than the Graco Quattro (that I love), but it is still a space hog.It is impossible to open this strap one-handed so that you can open the stroller.I know this is a common feature on strollers, but there must be a better way to do this.Also, once the stroller is locked, the front wheels still turn, so you can't lean it against a wall.THINGS I DID LIKE:I liked the color and design.I managed to put a medium sized fountain soda cup in one.Most umbrella strollers don't even have these cup holders.LOVED the inside pockets.When my son would pull his socks off, I'd tuck them in the inside pockets, along with some toys etc.Especially nice since there isn't room for a large diaper bag in the underneath storage.Overall, I think the stroller looks wonderful and has some useful features, but it didn't work properly for me.Mainly, I think the canopy would bother him, because it blocked his vision if he sat back, so he would lean forward and seemed altogether uncomfortable.I couldn't resist trying it out.So far I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.It feels much more sturdy, the handles are higher and more comfortable to grip.I needed a stroller with a good size canopy, big basket and comfy ride and this Joovy stroller is all that and more!a super smooth ride for my little girl.the grips are a nice foam rubber, so its nice and comfy for your hands.the canopy is HUGE and gives great coverage with a nice peek-a-boo window.The reflective areas on this stroller are very easy to see at night.I love the little mesh pockets inside the seat to place sippy cups and toys.And I even love the color, Appletree!It folds down nicely, (about 1/3 of the size of my Cortina) but not as small and compact as a normal umbrella stroller.but since most umbrella strollers hardly give you a basket and their canopy is a joke, I think the Joovy offers the best of both worlds.Their cup holder is a little wobbly, but I can fit my water bottle in there fine.Their zipper pocket is nice to keep first aid kit and keys.I really love this mobile.I waited until I found the right mobile before I bought one.I am so happy that I did.I love Nature's Serenade because it's attention grabbing, and it has more than just the strung creatures going in circles.It's so awesome because sometimes you want to covertly turn it on/off without your child seeing you and thinking that you're going to pick them up causing them to fuss.It's peaceful enough.The umbrella part of the mobile comes off and you can keep the base with the frog and music attached to the crib.We have a 3 month old and he was not interested in a mobile we received as a gift but we really needed something to make his crib fun.It has lights at the top of the mobile, assorted music, moving bugs on the mobile and a remote.The only con I have is that we have a 4-in-1 crib and had to modify how it attached to the crib.This mobile is colorful and the music is great and peaceful, some people say it is too loud, honestly it didn't seem so loud to me.It is great to keep the baby distracted for a 20 minutes while you get some things done.(The remote also consumes an incredible amount of energy of the batteries and fast!)I decided to order this as my son loves to pull/chew on my jewelry when I am carrying him around.No sooner did I take this out of the package and start wearing it than my son had it in his mouth and was chewing on it within a minute!I was pleasantly surprised when I received it and found that it is very pretty and looks like a necklace instead of a teething ring.I like that it has a breakaway clasp so that if he pulls on it, it will come off instead of posing an entanglement hazard.My son loves to chew on this and it definitely keeps him occupied!My daughter had broken 2 of my chains.This she couldn't break, and loved playing with/chewing on it.And it looks fabulous!I wouldn't pay $20 for it, but for $10 I was very happy with my purchase.WOW, this is a great necklace.It is so great that I bought 3 of them in different colors so I would always have one around to wear.Our daughter started teething at 4 months and had 2 teeth out and fully functional before her 6 month birthday, so we had lot of chewing right out of the babygate.These necklaces look like stone or jade rings, but have the perfect semi-soft texture that is great for teething babes.Before I found these, I had a goofy looking teething ring I'd wear on my wrist; I am not a vanity hound, but since there are days I am under-slept and/or don't get to wash my hair -- it is nice to wear something pretty.This would make a wonderful shower gift, or gift to aunties and grandmas.He liked the playtex ventair, but I hated cleaning those so wanted something a little better.Finally came across these, and he absolutely loves them!Also, when my daughter attempts to eat, though rated as slow flow, the nipple drips too fast and she can not keep up with it, resulting in her choking and milk getting everywhere.I really wish that I had purchased only one of these bottles instead of a pack of three!There are SO MANY parts to this bottle that cleaning has become SUCH a pain for us!!I love this diaper pail!I bought this one for my second child and it is well worth the money.The refills are very easy to replace, and the pail itself is very easy to put together.I love that there is a pedal to step on to open it, and that you just have to drop the diaper in.It is also the perfect height, not too tall, not too short.I would recommend this to any new parent, or anyone looking for a new diaper pail.That being said, I am very pleased with this product and would highly recommend it to other new parents.It's at a comfortable height for both myself (5'3") and my husband (5'10") to use.We're not exactly gentle with it sometimes and it's held up very well to 7 1/2 months of daily use.This was a great purchase for our nursery.She got it for me as a gift which was nice.I absolutely LOVE my diaper genie II elite!It is easy to use - the refills attach to the top of the inside of the pail.The refills are a little pricey and the pail itself isn't very pretty, but it's a huge lifesaver!This is one of the few items I couldn't live without!I have no complaints about the Diaper Genie II elite.I just started my third refill, and my son is 3 months old, so I go through about a refill every month.I have only used this for three weeks, but so far it's awesome.It works great!But it seems a bit cheaply made for the cost.Would definitely recommend the Genie Elite II!!Also a tip- I put an air freshener at the bottom of the pails anyway... and it is effective when changing the bags on the Genie.The package came with one refill and that lasted a month.Update, my baby is now 6 months old and eating solids.It is a miracle how effectively it contains the smell.Odors seem to be contained and it is working just as advertised.The refill cartridge has an exposed sharp circular lip that can catch and skin on your knuckles as you go to push the used diaper through the springloaded flap.I received the Sleepy Wrap as a baby shower gift, and it has proven itself to be a fantastic product.He either looks around happily or sleeps peacefully.There is no external pressure on his head, so it's much better than laying him in a swing, bouncer or crib.I can even breastfeed my son in the Wrap.We also have a Baby Bjorn, which my husband often wears, and he prefers the Sleepy Wrap for both his and baby's comfort.The only con of the Sleepy Wrap is that it takes practice to put it on just right, but after about a dozen times it becomes second nature.Also, as I mentioned above, I do have to reposition him to nurse, which often leaves the Wrap stretched and I have to re-wrap it in order to get the snug fit I desire.When I got it, I did love it.Anyway, I'm sure that this is wonderful for people with more grace and patience than I.UPDATE!!!I still don't use this at home, but am so happy to have it when we go on outside excursions!As my little guy is only 7 days old we don't have YEARS of experience with the wrap, but I can tell you we've used it everyday since he's come home!!!It's wonderful.LOVE IT!Once you've got it on securely (I would try practicing several times and carry baby around the house before going outside with it) your baby should fit nicely in it.I don't think the fabric breathes well.Perhaps when fall comes, it will be a more comfortable (temp wise) fit for my babe, but for now I am not all that impressed with it.I got both the Sleepy Wrap and Moby Wrap and have tried them both out to see which one I liked better.The baby is right there against you feeling the rise and fall of your chest as you breathe, hearing your heart beat, feeling your body heat, etc.This is a wonderful and easy way to 'wear' your baby.*Update*It's been well over a year since I purchased this wrap.My baby was a preemie and I found the wrap was a very good way of having skn-to-skin contact.But this wrap was ideal for the newborn stage, and so affordable that I felt I could have both types of carriers without breaking the bank.Well, this has worked out perfectly for our tub, which is separate from our shower, so no extra metal piece on top.I also expect it will last much longer than something inflatable, have used it for maybe a couple of weeks now and very happy with the purchase.Once we were onto finger foods or things with chunks it didn't work.-If you're making your own food (as we did) you have to make sure it's a very smooth puree.Pea skins, little bits of mango that weren't totally pureed (I mean tiny little chunks that the blender missed and you wouldn't notice otherwise) can get stuck and make it hard to get the food out.I us a baby food mill and the consistency that it grinds the cooked food into is too chunky for the tiny hole in the spoon.However - it is AWESOME for using in a restaurant or on the go.I saw a review where the person said the food got all over the place - I don't know how hard she was squeezing but you gently press it and the food comes out.*  Two, I'm not sure HOW you don't contaminate the rest of the food inside the bulb.I wouldn't count on this thing not contaminating the rest of the food.But, if you're looking to use it to feed the same food over an extended period, I wouldn't chance it.If they made a full cap, I'd give it another star.Bought this last week and using it every day!My 7 month old is a quick eater so this helps tremendously.=) It's easy to clean, even if you don't clean it right away all you need to do is to soak it in some water and everything washes right off.Also, not super sturdy floating in the water.I bought 2 of the yellow tinted ones and 4 blue ones when my baby was 6 months old, and they worked fine for a while, now all of a sudden they ALL -both kinds- leak about half the time.The funny part is, when you first buy them--they don't leak at all.Hated every Avent bottle I tried.We loved these bottles for our now 3 1/2 year old daughter and love them still.I highly recommend them.I use the bottles to give my son expressed breast milk - I had to make sure he would take a bottle so if I go back to work other people will be able to feed him.Great bottle!If you take the extra nanoseconds and made sure the nipple "clicks" into the ring and make sure the ring is screwed on correctly, you should experience no leaking.It takes me six minutes to wash eight nine-ounce bottles, nipples, rings, and covers.I only have to wash one time a day.A wonderful bottle from a trusted company!These bottle will leak horribly if the nipple is screwed on too tight.These are nice because you don't have to deal with the extra insert that Dr Brown and Born Free have.Those are great too, but cumbersome with the anti-gas insert.These are a better choice if you can remember to not screw the top on so tight.Hope this helps!I bought these for them being BPA free but i really regret it.The bottles are good making of course but they leak almost every time if you don't align the bottle and the cap in a certain way then flip it over to see if they leak or not.If you cannot do without them, buy just one and see if you;re comfortable with them.I love these bottles.This will be my fourth baby that I use them with.I have never had an issue with leaks, because I read the directions and followed them with perfect results.The front of the boxes are open-faced with no cellophane wrapping, thus exposing the bottles to everything.I would love to keep them for the great price I got on them, but I don't feel comfortable using them with all the scratches in the plastic.Amazon's customer service was fantastic and let me return them at their expense.If this flap comes in perfect contact with the neck of the bottle as you are screwing on the cap, then it won't leak.I still haven't been able to get it to work correctly.Who needs such a headache with twins?We have since switched to Evenflo Classic glass bottles.They are a fraction of the price, recyclable, super easy to clean, non-BPA, and sturdy.Please do not buy them- they will drive you insane!I figured she knew what she was talking about working with babies all day.Also- I read reviews on all different sites and they are all over the place!So I just figured I would give them a try.I really wish I had done more research before purchasing a whole bunch of these bottles when my son was born.I tried making sure the top wasn't too tight - they still leaked.I tried making sure the nipples were aligned a certain way, according to a guide I found online - they still leaked.I love these bottles!Specifically, I love the yellow ones, not the clear ones.Customer service with this vendor was terrible and they would not reimberse me or even send me a shipping label so that I could send it back - Amazon finally had to refund my money.For the two that worked, it ALWAYS shows red or orange - we have one in the basement and the bedroom, but it always shows hotter than it is.We got this because it was cute (I'm a sucker for creative packaging..) and seemed to be easy as far as the color-coded system.After plugging it in, I found that you have to wait at least 10 minutes to get an accurate reading.We plugged it in in the afternoon, got a warm reading, which made sense.Then checked it first thing in the A.M. 7:00 ish, and it was in the "yellow" perfect zone.Yay, happy.It is like a mini night light and I like seeing the temp from bed.I think it will be great.I needed some objective way to tell if the temperature was right in the dark room.My son just loves giving it to my daughter.The pacifier is attached to the dragon.I like this because it is colorful and cute.My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the dragon being one of them.He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part.That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up.I highly recommend Wubbanubs!My daughter who is 14 months finds these alot of fun.She even totes them out of the tub.She doesn't really play with the net but she absolutley loves these fun shapes.Great gift to help her start learning to count and identify colors.Shipping was fast and item came in good condition.The net is solid and the shapes are unique.They love it!They even like to play with the fish pieces outside of the tub.It's also great because it works on hand-eye coordination.This is the perfect bag for a "day out with the kid(s)."Plenty of space and pockets in the large compartment, a great mommy section, and good outside pockets.I really like the crumb drain, the grip shoulder strap, and the silver inside lining.I bought this bag because I needed primarily a diaper bag for my second daughter, however I also have a four year old who always has stuff that she needs to put in a bag.I like that this bag is big enough for pretty much everything a newborn needs, and that when fully packed doesn't weigh a ton if I don't have my stroller (and stroller clips).I sometimes wish there was an outside bottle pocket like the Be All has but overall I am very happy with this bag and would recommend it to a parent with two kids.I also own theJu Ju Be Be Tween Diaper Bag, Black/Silverwhich is my everyday diaper bag.I love the quality of Ju Ju Be's bags; great material and nice fabrics.The Be Spicy has lots of pockets, inside and out to hold everything you need for an overnight/weekend trip.I love the insulated bottle pockets on the outside (there are 2 on this bag).The inside of this bag will hold a lot; I was able to fit 8-10 diapers, a big pack of wipes, burp clothes, extra clothes, several toys, 2 blankets, and more with some room to spare.I love the extra long key fob on the bags, no more searching for keys with one hand while holding the baby.The changing pad that comes with this bag is big and cushy, love the memory foam!This is a great bag, a little to big for me to use on a everyday basis but perfect for overnights and weekend trips.I like the shoulder strap and included stroller straps since my stroller has very little cargo space underneath.I thought this set would be perfect for my 1.5 year old.Unlike other reviewers, I don't find the size too small -- I think little bites are easier for my child.Please watch your child carefully when using these utensils.I'm able to scrape the sweet potato easily out of the skin.This one just doesn't work for us.This spoon is awesome.Just bend the head to compensate for how she holds it and voila!in her mouth the food goes.This bottle warmer does the job and works fast, but it is somewhat flawed in design.Also, it would be great if it had a timer on it?!Instead we use our stove timer, which is fine, but it just seems like the bottle warmer should have a timer on it.Very simple to operate.The bottle warmer is compact and easy to use.It's got a sticker on the back with recommendations for how much water to fill in the warmer and how long to leave it on depending on how many ounces you need to warm.Leaving the bottle in even for a minute past the recommendation can make the milk too warm.I find myself frequently pulling out the bottle and checking the tempurature to make sure it isn't took warm.Better not to have a light at all.Next to our wipe warmer, this bottle warmer is one of the best baby accessories we own!It's very simple to use.Put your bottle in, fill the water to the appropriate level, and you'll have warm food/milk straight from the fridge in less than 5 minutes.The heating reservoir is of ample size, so it will warm many different sizes of food containers.However, if you know to watch for this, you will be just fine.The Philips avent heats evenly and instead of a set temperature it leaves the onus of gauging the temp of food to the parent as per their needs .. need it just warm enough then keep it for the recommended time as per the instructions .. as your kid grows and you need it a little more warmer then just extend the time window you keep the food in warmer to get your custom/desired temp .. great product !I really like this sterilizer because it holds a lot of bottles but it not a huge appliance.This is a super convienent item if you have a new baby.The buttons are not intuitive.You need to hold the buttons down to turn it on.Easy to operate.A few extra button clicks to get it running might scare some people.I like this warmer which I've used with wide bottles, both avent and playtex (up to 9 oz bottles).That feature would make it perfect.It is very easy to use and it does an extremely good job.I loved this sterilizer until it died after 91 days of regular usage.Everything else I have used from Avent and Phillips has been of the highest quality so I was shocked.It is very practical and saves time since I don't have to go to the kitchen to sterilize the bottles and can concentrate everything in my daughter's bathroom.This makes me somewhat uncomfortable.Other than that, the sterilizer is wonderful.I don't know how to categorize this item.Well it's all of the above.You have 2 zippered pockets for money: one on the outside for easy access and one on the inside.It also comes with a retractable pen.I love this item so much, I bought a second one in a different print.This holds everything I need, in addition to my chapstick and spare camera battery.The interior mesh pocket fit my camera and backup battery perfectly.There is a back zip pocket too, for items you need fast access to (like cash or a hotel room key).we bought this plus 2 other teethers in this series for our 6 month old because we were looking for something organic and safe for him to chew on.Lo and behold, he loves the thing.Plus, the top is totally shaped like a nipple, so he gets it in his mouth and just goes to town, pacifier style.I bought two of these for friends because Sophie is everywhere and I wanted to give them something different.It is very easy for my 5.5 month old to grasp and play with.I bought this little guy and the yellow one just like it for my grand baby.These are ADORABLE!!He loves them!I highly recommende these for all teething babies.Love the natural materials too!We bought this item first because Sophie was too expensive and we weren't sure we were going to love it.He's easy for young babies to grip and has that ever-so-familiar head for all the nursing babies.Well, needless to say, we loved it so much that we splurged on Sophie too!Sophie doesn't squeak as easily and has more nooks and crannies that aren't so familiar.Although Sophie is good, Chan is GREAT!She started using it at 4 months and is now 9 months and chomps on it just like she did 5 months ago!He has not taken it out of his mouth since we got it!He loves to chew on the loop (i was going to use the links to put through it but i guess not since he loves to chew the loop!)Joking aside, considering we're willing to put up with rounds of squeaky toy madness (in which we dub our 5 month year old, the littlest clown), makes it worth the 15 bucks, just on sheer entertainment value alone.This is a really nice teether.It's soft, easy for baby to hold, and fits into his mouth in more than one way.We liked that it better than other teethers and bought another for our 3 month old.He loves it.It works well as a teether too, without any adult assistance.Chan is soft, safe rubber and easy to gnaw on, and easy to wipe clean too.And yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, its head is rather boob-shaped, but my breastfed baby loved that, so no complaints about design here.;)I loved the fact that it was something my baby could use as a teether, but it wouldn't aggravate her reflux/gag-reflex, like some pacifiers did.It really is worth the money, and I highly recommend it.The top is shaped like a boob and son just chews away at it which is fine since it is all natural materials.Some babies like the giving texture of a chewing toy for teething and I made sure of this first before dropping $15 on it lol!I got this for my daughter, because my son wouldn't give up his Sophie Giraffe.It squeaks really easily, you can hold it by the loop and just moving it around will cause it to make noises.They're a safer shape, less likely to be choked on, the yellow one has a cool loop you can attach it to strollers, high-chairs, car-seats, or anything else you can think of.I got them because we can't install a diaper sprayer in our rental house, and my daughter just started solids so she has those "in between" BM's as she transitions from EBF to solids.A flushable liner was key, and the small size works well for my bottle fed infant, but they bunch up and don't collect everything you need to most of the time.we started with the small, using bumgenius all in ones.i think that no matter the size of the baby or the diaper, go with the large... with the small the poop made it past the liner easily and got all over the place.I bought two 5 packs.I rated it 3 stars because I liked the bibs, but the bibs were small and then shrank.I would return them, but it isn't worth it for me to do so.I will be giving this item to Goodwill and hope that someone else will be able to use them.I didn't realize it until I washed them and tried on my son.Otherwise they will be great for newborns.These were the perfect size for my newborn son, but he is growing out of them.They are adorable as well and very absorbent.For the price and quality, I have been very pleased with them thus far.They get stiff & winkled after a few washes and since they are not very big, other than using them as changing pad tops, we haven't had much of other use for them...I already bought this very same carters blanket from BabiesRUs, then I needed another one, so I bought here from Amazon.Don't know why, but the difference between the two supposely identical blanket is day and night.It's the perfect size- not too big, not too small.I love it!It also fits nicely inside the medium sized diaper bags to help keep everything more separate and organized.It comes with a wristlet option to carry it with you or attach it to your stroller or I've even attached it to my baby carrier when I want my hands/arms free.It has a large open space that you can fit a package of wipes and many diapers.I have fit about 6 size 1 diapers or 3/4 size 6 diapers AND it as an inside zipper pocket that can hold more items.I also own purple paisley and shadow waltz.I like this changing table a lot.It had a couple dents from shipping and and was missing some of the screws but my husband said it not abig deal- hes going to pick some at the Home Depot or other store.Changing table part is very nice and big and wide- lots of room for baby.But the changing pad is very thin, we will buy one at the store (thicker one).Overall i am pleased with this item.The pacifiers themselves are great and my babies love them, but if I had it to do over again I would have purchased cheaper MAM pacifiers and put a glow in the dark sticker on them so I could find them in the dark.My husband went to pick up some more Gerber waterproof multi-use pads for the changing table since he keeps throwing them away when they get poop on them...They are small first of all, they are pretty much the same size as the baby but since when does anything that comes out of baby contain itself to one small area?After 5 months they have a little fraying on the edges, I can live with that.BTW...With our first child, I bought 2 packs of these.This is great!!Everyone should have these in the nursery.If baby soils this, just pull out a clean one and wash the soiled one with the rest of the laundry.These stay rolled up no matter how many times you wash them or try to keep them unrolled.The terry-cloth on top and the waterproof material underneath are melded together.On these however, they are just cheaply sewn together around the border.Boppy's changing pad slipcover/liner system is a really good idea.I've been tossing them in with the regular wash and dryer settings and my 3 pads still look brand new.These work great and we have had them for 3 months.They work exactly as advertised and we wouldn't want to live without them.Once you wash them they curl up into a tight scroll and will not lay flat again.It is by far her most favorite activity, although now she is out growing it (4.5 months old, 16 pounds and 28 inches) already.From early on she was quite an active baby, always kicking and squirming.When I first bought the slider she couldn't reach more than her toes so I added a book.That hid the lights and prevented the motion activated sounds but helped her out, but there is a setting for constant music.At first she wasn't sure what to do and the motion made her feel like she was falling.Once she felt secure it was all go!The music is cheery and my daughter likes it when I dance along with it for her amusement.She slides happily along.That was fine until she tipped too far forwad and tilted sideways.I do like the music, lights, and the vibration.So it's a big leap of faith when it comes to the pricing.This is a bit upright and he is completely comfortable, and no reflux problems.I love how there are so many uses for this, more than a regular bouncy seat.He gets exercise, visual & audio stimulation, and a place to sleep.I will start off with saying that this item is very cheaply made.Plus my son did not like it until he was 2 months old.We complemented it with Tiny Love Stroll Arch to occupy his hands as well.I bought this on a whim before my son was born...so glad I did!It keeps them protected, but easily accessible.The pod is well-made, doesn't show stains and easy to open with one hand.The elastic bands inside are great for securing the pacifiers so they don't fall out when you open it.I love this pacifier holder.I LOVE this pacifier holder.It is a good size (not big at all) but still holds 2 pacifiers (and we are on the 6 months plus pacifiers now).Washes easily and I LOVE knowing it won't harbor bacteria, given that my son will be putting this in his mouth.The Paci Pod from Ju-Ju-Be is very good quality.I actually have the natural ones, and not the white.I can not say for a diaper but for a burpcloth it works great.They are also very small.I will getting the regular diaper service quality prefolds from Gerber instead.They turned out great, hold up well in the wash.I'm very pleased with this purchase and would maybe even order again.I haven't tried them yet but did change my registry to the traditional ones after I got these.The "natural" color version of these diapers shed terribly after the first wash.The pills just don't seem to go away even after repeated washes.I bought two packs and lost the reciept, so I guess I'll just use them as rags, or extra wipes when I run low.Some of these were given to me at our baby shower, and I'm glad I'd already researched and purchased the cloth diapers we intended to use as diapers.I bought our actual diapers online, and they are thick, soft, cut straight, hemmed well, and of a good size.I wish they were a bit thicker, but they are a good basic diaper.The range is fantastic, we can do yard work, play with the dogs and wander around outside and still hear her take a deep breath or roll over.The lights are a great add on for when you can't hear (on the phone, mowing, in the shower, etc...)I love the talk feature as well, if baby wakes up crying I talk to her and she calms down while I'm in route to her room.There is zero feedback unless you carry the receiver to close to the base.We were hesitant about spending so much but don't regret it at all.This would be a verified amazon purchase review but my husband bought it on his account.Placed the baby unit basically right next to his crib and moved the parent unit throughout the house after being recharged.We're on the second floor and there are 5 other units in the building, one of which is across from us and has a baby as well.Things I like about it:-compact size / lightweight-long adapter cords.so if charging the unit, can put it pretty far if the outlet is far or maybe behind some furniture or something.-very clear sound, static free - so clear that I couldn't tell if it was working or not since it's so quiet-easy to use-page button-has volume and sensitivity buttons-walkie talkie talk button on parent unit.great feature if i'm in the baby room while my husband is somewhere else, we can talk to each other.we can also calm the baby down without going into the room with our voices (doesn't always work though ;))-rechargeable battery included in parent unit.It was great at first but after about 2 months it started deteriorating.Not sure if it had to do with new tenants moving in or another baby moving in next door so they had a baby monitor too or more wireless things we bought or what...but it was causing huge static/interference on the parent units that sounds like old radios.This could not last as out sleep was suffering.Doing a little research we happened upon this item.The DACT filtering really works and works well.All you get is the noise of your wee one.This is amazingly handy - and a great feature.It is advertised as a way to sooth your child and while I'm not sure about that (that's not really my style) I can say its a great way to talk without yelling to one another.Overall setup was a breeze.Thankfully these are both plug and battery operated.It should easily last a few years.And it can take a fall.Did I mention that it's whisper quiet!If you are looking for a quiet baby monitor and you have a ton of electronic devices around, this is the monitor to get.And the best part is- no static!!I can hear my baby breathing on this and I like that I can turn down the sensitivity if I don't want to hear everything.There is absolutely ZERO interference since it operates on its own frequency.I also love that it lights up when it detects noise....that way when I am blow-drying my hair and can't listen to it, I can just watch it to see if my daughter woke up.Sound quality is perfect, crystal clear with no interference.However, the battery life on the parent unit is nowhere near the advertised 24 hours.Going to call Philips tomorrow and see what they say.This monitor is pretty solid.The sounds are clear and the level of sensitivity can be easily changed.My only complaint is that we don't get anywhere near a 24 hour battery life.The sensitivity level can be set so high that we can actually hear our little girl breath - makes my heart at ease!My mom ended up ordering one of these off Amazon.com and hers didn't work that well.For some reason the parent part of the monitor had a difficult time connecting to the baby part of the monitor.She called Philips Avent and their customer service was incredible.Our original one ended up having the same issue as my mom's - the parent unit said it was linked to the baby unit, but you couldn't hear anything.I love that you can talk back and forth with both peices.We couldn't believe it picked that up, it was amazing.You can also adjust the sensativity of it so that it picks up more or less noise.For example I can turn on my monitor and hear my child breathing or I can adjust it and only pick it up when he is crying so if you have a noise maker or whatever it doesn't pick that up too.If you have a ton of technology in your house or live in a neighborhood with lots of baby monitors and don't want to deal with picking up every other kid except yours, this is the baby monitor for you!What I don't like is the fact that it is super quiet, even at its highest setting.It works for me because I have super sensitive hearing and usually have the monitor set very quiet, but I can see how that wouldn't work for someone else, that they might sleep through their baby fussing.I still think it's a great monitor and it works for us, just be cautious if you need something really loud.Update...We've now had the monitor for almost a year and I still love it!Reason being, the parent volume is less than acceptable.There's never any interference from other electronics and I've never heard anything but my baby.I wish I could set the lower range of the temperature for hotter (our baby likes it quite warm) but that's my only complaint.I bought this because I wanted a natural teether that could stay cold for our 6 month old.these are adorable!But these are much cuter =)We got our first set of these as a gift, and bought a second set because they are so much more useful than the oval rings you can get from other manufacturers.They are colorful, strong, flexible, and multi-purpose.The large ends on the links make them not very compatible with stuffed toys that have loops, but my baby loves the large teething surface, and they are fun for the parent: you can talk about the different animals.All attributes to make baby happy.They are probably the cheapest "toy" I have, and the most popular except the jumperoo.That makes mama happy.Living in Florida, the light mesh seats was a huge plus to me.The stroller was so easy to use.(And the great color helped me find it easily in the stroller parking!)I love that this stroller is lightweight, easy to maneuver and that the seats can be reclined.In my opinion the canopies are too small to adequately protect against the sun.Also, there is little room to store anything in this stroller (just two tiny side pockets, no basket underneath).I have the normal Graco stroller that comes with a carseat that attaches to a stroller it works great.I bought this for our Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame.It fits perfectly and keeps my daughter snug and dry, even through heavily pouring rain (I walk her 15 minutes to and from daycare every day, so it's received its fair share of use!)My only complaint is the very strong "plastic" odor it had when first opened.I got it as a nightlight for my 2 year old son.My  son LOVES it!It has acutal constellations to find in it to, but my son is too young for that yet.I highly recommend!I bought this as an alternative to our current, brighter night light option.The light projection is pleasing and certainly appealing to my little one (9 month old son).My issues with this item are:~Aquamarine: unless mine happens to be defective (and I think it isn't) this color doesn't actually happen.That's why I bought this.My 10 month old son LOVES his turtle.We put in on when he is going to bed and sometimes we bring it under the covers of our bed, he loves to "touch" the stars on the comforter.This way you can remove it for cleaning at anytime.Our Frog Pod kept falling and falling with the plate that came with it... this suction plate is a lifesaver.This thing works wonderfully!You can tell of the quality as soon as you pull it out.This is a lovely sheet in a really nice color.Very soft, well made, and comfortable for our son's skin.It washes well--after a couple washings it still looks new.We are very pleased with it, and may end up purchasing a few more.Loved it and the baby too.So we are hooked now - all I want is these in my baby's crib.My son is 11 months old and we have been using regular cotton sheets for his crib until I bought this.I wanted something that would be warm for the winter and now I regret ordering just one sheet set.Order at least 2.This sheet fits very well, is super soft, warm for winter, my daughter likes it, the chocolate color is nice, washes up great so far!I purchased this sheet in the sage color, and absolutely love it!Held up beautifully in the wash, and it's SUPER lush, soft, warm, and cozy!Sage color is light and beautiful.I highly recommend this sheet!I bought this sheet to pair with a Carters bumper and crib skirt, and have found it to be absolutely perfect.The fabric is luxuriously soft even after washing, roomy enough to fit waterproof pads beneath for crib accidents, and the color is beautiful.The fabric is airy enough to use for year-round softness, not just for colder months.Seems very well-made and is cozy and warm for a newborn, which is nice since they can't sleep under a pile of soft blankets.I was trying to find a sheet that was thick and warm for my 18 month old that we still do not cover with a blanket.This is it!The sheet is so soft and is warm even before she lays on it.I bought 2 of these, usually a very loyal Carters customer.The sheet is great- very soft and fits perfectly.I can't assess how well the sheet will hold up after multiple washings- I'm sure it will be fine though!I bought these sheets for my son's crib because I realized, as the nights are getting chillier and I switched my own sheets to flannel, that he would appreciate something less cold to lay on.The reviews were so positive that I bought two sets right off.I am happy with the purchase: the sheets are super soft to the touch.The fit is a little loose and may be of concern for those with infants.These are the absolute softest sheets ever!Once past the catch, the latch's spring pushes the latch into the upward position.This could be accomplished by removing most of the vertical surface on the catch where the latch is suppose to touch and bend down.Unfortunately it's not as long as my crib, so it's a bit tight, my last one was tight also & the ties kept ripping off, hope that doesn't happen with this one.Pretty soft pink color & nice material that washed up nicely.Super soft, a great value.The quality is great and fits perfectly.It is sturdy so it doesn't bunch up.It fits perfectly with just enought ties to keep it in place.It's very soft, yet sturdy enough to stay in place.This bumper is wonderfully soft and plush.We have a sleigh crib and I was worried it would not fit, but it fit perfectly!I highly recommend it!Available in many colors, and in bassinet size too."Our son loves this sheet.It is very soft and comfortable.He sleeps very well on it, and we don't worry about it being rough against his face.very pleased with this fitted sheet - very soft, fits snugly, but stretches easily to get it on the mattress, even after washing - washes wellThey fit pretty well, with a little bit of extra give, and I haven't had any issue with them shrinking after washing.We got them in blue and it is a very nice color for our son's crib.When we received these sheets we were very happy with how soft they were and the color was perfect.I tried it on our crib mattress for size and it fit great.The size is generous, enough to swaddle a baby.It's not as soft as I would like it to be that is why I just gave this 4 stars BUT the baby will still feel comfortable and won't really hurt their skin.These blankets are soft and I like the prints and colors.I love Carters, all of their items are soo soft and these blankets are the same!I love the pattern and the size of them is perfect to grow with the newborn baby.They wash very well!Perfect as a swaddling blanket or a lightweight summer stroller blanket.They are much larger than other brands of receiving blankets.I just love these!very nice collers, easy to wash( washinemachine), I drip dry.I have 3 of these sheets, will buy more, because I have a 4-1 confurtable crib , so I'll use these longer, perhaps 2 to 3 years.You don't need to look furter.I bought these for my girls' mattresses.The pattern is great.Very pleased with our purchase.No complaints from me... pretty happy with this cover!We used it on a cross-country flight and it held up just fine through gate check.For the price I really didn't care because I expected it to be a one-time use item, and am now pleasantly surprised I will probably be able to use it at least a few more times.It held up great and did exactly as I needed it to.We bought this and have used it 5 times and it is still in GREAT condition.The strap works well but most importantly it is still all together in one piece after being manhandled by my husband's on various flights.We always gate check it but I could see it still holding up if you needed to check it as luggage.and 3) it's only meant to hold 150 lbs - so don't let grandpa sit on it just for fun, it's not meant to hold that kind of weight and can lead to minor cracks over time.I saw recently that Stokke succumed to the pressure and is now providing a tray to attach to the seat.It's sad, I think, because the whole point of this chair is that it brings the child to the table, not making them feel like they separate.As another writer noted, the highchair is an item that you want to be VERY pleased with, not just find satisfactory, because you and your child will be using it multiple times a day for a long time.I initially purchased a consumer reports recommended model that cost about  half of the stokke.I have been able to adjust the height so that our son sits comfortably at the table with us.I bought the baby insert but not the padding and he has always appeared perfectly comfortable without it.To protect the table I bought several BPA-free serving trays from IKEA and attached non-slip shelf liner to the back using double sided tape.They work wonderfully in containing spills and also make bringing food to the table much quicker.We are nearing the age where other toddlers are getting booster seats but luckily do not have to worry about that extra transition with the stokke.Friends had the Sokke Tripp Trapp and loved it.It's nice for the child to be able to be a part of the meal versus separated because of the chair.The design means our son can climb in and out of it on his own and there is almost no chance it will fall over.It pulls right up to the table so he can interact with us during meals and we can give him food - if he/we so desire.The cushion works well and we haven't had to clean it (other than to wipe off crumbs/debris).My only complaint (and why I didn't give it 5 stars) is that the straps are too big.I think it is a necessary item for starting out and we love it and would gladly repurchase it.It is great for our 15 lb daughter.It has a nice rounded lip on it that baby can grab onto and she seems very comfortable and happy up at the table with us.Looks very nice, and is soft.Light in weight, and beautiful!UPDATE: My son is now 3 years old!We still own this blanket and I still love it!My son still uses it even at 3!In the picture it looks like the colors are nice, but when it arrived it was in far stronger colors than expected and not to my liking.I wanted to return it but have yet to hear from the company, mind you its only been 2 days so they can still make it.Being a first time Mommy, I wanted to make sure my baby was comfortable and sitting on something cushy.These items are not very cushy and to be honest, they just get dirty.It wasn't as slippery and made it easier for her to pick up food that dropped onto her chair.We bough this to attach to the front of our sleigh style crib.I love the leachco easy teather XL!I feel like it really does its job.My son still bits down, but now I dont have to deal with any marks on the cirb!The downside here is that you can't use the straps that hold teethers, but for me, that's not a big deal.The bigger deal for me is that when I lean against the crib to put down my sleeping baby, sometimes I move slightly which is enough to put a little strain on the velcro and make a noise.!This cover is large, which is great for cribs with a really fat rail.I decided to give this bottle a try without even knowing much about it.She was not too fond of the bottles and I had to be a bit creative.It is really nice and helps your baby learn to feed themselves and stop using bottles.quality fleece hasn't pilled through multiple washes and I love the inverted zipper design which prevents zipper from scratching baby's neck and faceIt's easy to use once you read the manual.I use it everyday,sometimes twice.I love this sterilizer.I wash my bottles and put them right into it.I bought this thinking it hwould be a huge help in the bottle dept, It does the job of sterilizing.If there is a time when I need to wash numerous bottles this will hopefully come in handy.My son typically has no skin dermatitis issues.Every time I have used these sheets (the most recent, obviously being the last) he develops a bright red cheek and chin on the side of his face that came into contact with the sheet.It unfortunately took me a while to make the connection.We loved the Kiddopatamus swaddlemes... and thought this would also be nice.It does not work nearly as well.I have the barnyard pattern one and it is soft and lightweight which is nice for summer.We found our new son was busting out of the Summer velcro swaddle by 3 months.He was too strong.No scratching baby-you can peel off the velcro swaddle and it's a wearable blanket to reduce sidsCons:-We tried using this when we FIRST bought him home from the hospital.I bought a Miracle Blanket and receiving blankets in hopes of using those.I had a Halo sleepsack, but it was for a larger sized baby.I was SO happy when I found out they had the 'newborn' size with the swaddler attachment.My little guy is not even 8 lbs yet, so this is PERFECT for him.He likes the swaddle portion better than the Miracle Blanket, because it's easy to position above the arms and even below the arms.This helped me tremendously with my fear that any portion could slide up to his face area obstructing breathing, as the Miracle Blanket sometimes does.We found out after the first night that if the climate is pretty warm in your room (we don't have AC but it's around 70 degrees in the room) to just put the baby in a side snap shirt or onesie with short arms and no legs.The sleepsuit is warm enough for the baby without all the extra clothing underneath.1st - I had a cute nuby flip top, you have to bite on the straw then suck - but it's a small size, so my 16 mo daughter wants to turn it back and then gets really aggravated when she's biting & sucking the straw and turning the cup up but nothing's coming out.I have tried this cup out myself, and the flow is the best from all the sippy cups I have tried.My 13 mo old twins love these cups!Also, the forks are very useful when they start eating more solids.However, they are actually pretty sturdy and we have washed them many times and they are still in good shape.I would recommend this item!We bought these to use as every day utensils and they have been wonderful!We have the Naturepedic crib mattress, as well as the Naturepedic waterproof crib pad.We have the full mattress pad on the mattress, then the portacrib pad over that (we have portacribs at both grandparents house, so we bring this pad along).Works well to reduce sweaty head from my toddler (have it in his toddler bed); not perfect, but the sweat has been reduced drastically.As other reviewers have mentioned, the actual color of these is a baby-blue, not the royal blue shown in the picture.Other than that, I'm very happy with these bed rails.It's nice that they both fold down, too.They were easy to install too, with no tools needed.Took my husband about 20 minutes.This works great...The edges bend with normal gravity, but it does cover all the area that's needed on the back seat.The elastic band at the bottom goes over the seat and is pulled down and then a velcro closure goes around the head rest posts.It is not an elegant solution but it does the job and looks better than some clear vinyl options.The velcro on top is not perfect.It is not as easy to fit as it could be if you really want a snug fit.What baby doesn't love to look at another baby:) It's a nice size as well and easy to install.Wow this mirror is amazing... it's huge and it has so many ways to be installed in your vehicle... so if you have an SUV or just plain bench seats, this is the best mirror and its screen size is large enough that you can actually see your baby.this works great and I was even able to attach an Elmo teether doll to it so baby can look at something.I love it!You might want to shop at Ross first....I saw a mirror there with music and other features for less than this cost.I've been looking for a photo album like this for several months.It's just the right size (~5" x7"), holds ~100 pictures (most albums either hold 24 or 200 pictures, too few or too many for me) and each page has a small space to write notes (dates, captions, etc).I received this highchair as a gift and absolutely love it!the base is wide and sturdy and the rollers move easily over different floor surfaces.there are no crevaces or sharp edges where my daughter can injure herself.If you really want to go all out, get a few extra tray inserts (2 come with it) and an extra seat pad (they have different colors of you're looking to match decor) so you always have a fresh one to put on.The tray size is great, we prefer not to have a huge tray.I love that you can see everything that needs to be cleaned because it can't get lost into fabric.The tray is compact which I love and since it has two notches to attach the tray I can get it right up to my son's belly.I really LOVE that the security straps have a mechanism that is so easy and smooth to lock and unlock.Super easy to put together.I believe compared to everything else out there it is the most stylish, hygenic, functional, safe chair out there for a fair price.It took my husband and myself to get her out.We had to push the crib from against the wall to gently turn her leg.I love this crib and it looks great, we were able to put this together in about 30 mins and had no issues doing so.The only complaint that I have about this is it arrived with a very large scratch on the front that I can't even cover and a few small ones which is very disappointing.It is very sturdy and extremely safe and so far can not see any faults in this crib, I am happy I chose the right one!It is absolutely gorgeous and VERY sturdy.The directions were good, and all the parts were there.It arrived with no scratches or anything.I bought this crib to replace a drop-side that had been donated to us.The cherry is a wonderfully rich hue and makes the ensemble appear more expensive than it is.the assembly process went smoothly.If you assemble enough items for kids, you will get used to them using minimal wording.Big enough for my son to do his rolling, but small enough to fit in my room until he's old enough to go it alone.Love this crib.It didn't hurt that I also got it for far less than the current price!It fits my crib great and seems to do the job.He has not tried to bite the rails anymore.Bought it when I didn't know much about my other options.This does what is supposed to, hold stuff so they don't end up in the nasty full of germen floor, these are so simple yet so practical, I definetively will be ordering more, I rather these to the links are way more simple and easy, and the price is good, you also can make them as long as you want attaching a few together.These are great little straps.Each strap has multiple spots where you can fasten it, so you can make it shorter or longer.I typically use BooginHead pacifier straps to attach toys, but at nearly $5 each that gets pricey.These Baby Buddy straps are much more economical for the purpose.These are great.Those Velcro or clip straps are only good until they figure out they can rip them right off.My boy is super strong but he can't get these snap straps off.I highly recommend them.I bought two of these and have them in two different locations in my house where I set up a diaper changing area.They keep me organized and efficient!Anatomy is appropriate.It has held up through almost daily use.I've had straw cups that have to be carefully threaded and pushed.This just pops in.A little pricey for a drinking cup but well worth every penny.It has been dropped many times in the past and it is almost two years old so I feel like it held up well.You have to spend quite a bit more for good quality natural mattresses and covers.It's bleached cotton which is highly fumigated and full of chemicals before it's even harvested, so I wasn't going into this being fooled by the word NATURAL on the package like a lot of people seem to be.It's quite pillowy, washed up fine.Fits my 5"+ mattress just fine.I bought this to go over my Beco Butterfly II.It's perfect!I bought a medium size.We live in a nice town and have a dog so we like to go on walks often.In "warmer" weather (above freezing) it's good to wear with just long sleeves underneath (for the adult).Actually, I would say that I got a little warm in it, but it seems that my kiddo was comfortable.It's pretty easy to put on (the hardest part is zipping it, but once you get the hang of it, it's no big deal).The pocket on the one side is great!So, when I bought this one I was not happy to say the least.In order to use the latch method you have to perfectly align the straps at or above the line--oh my god!But, when you do, that seat will not move one millimeter.I feel so much more relieved that she isn't fiddling and out of her seat belt.It is worth every penny and curse word!We originally got my daughter a Recaro Vivo, but in our Minivan, it didn't function properly (the strap was getting twisted up and not retracting like it should).She loves that she has her own cup holder too!This is the Second Compass seat we've purchased from Amazon - the first is now in the babysitters car.I absolutely loved the first one we bought back in 2007 - it had a giraffe print and most all the same features as this one.This is great, as our daughter would sometimes complain of being uncomfortable on long drives with the old seat.In general, the main benefits to the Compass seats are as follows:-lightweight: easy to carry when needed-folds in half: again, making it easy to carry when needed.Also great if you put it on an airplane, as it protects it somewhat with only the outer shell being exposed and the softer cushion areas closed up in the "clam" part of the seat.-have two cup holders: once you have these any seat without them seems a hardship.You'll use them for more than just sippy cups!It is held in by the seatbelt, which is also what holds in your child.The seat has easy to see guide paths for where the seatbelt should go.You just push two levers on the back and it slides up and down - you can easily do this 20x per day if needed as it only takes two seconds to do.-Cushy Padding on newer models: The newer model compass seats, such as this polka dotted one, have much more padding than previous models and most other competing brands.This makes the seat much more comfortable for your child.-Side impact rated: Not all seats offer side impact protection, but this one does.My friend was recently hit from the side and both of her kids (5 and 3) were fine.However, she said based on the experience she'll always have the side impact seats, as it prevented a whipping motion of their heads from side to side with the impact.We've gone through many different models of seats, including Britax and Ricaro (both much more expensive) and the Compass seats are our favorites overall.Seriously are ppl complaining about cleaning two more parts?Yes it's a lot of part but doesn't take my whole day to wash them!I don't even have a dishwasher, so yes I wash them by hand!They are great bottles and my little one loves them!These bottles are perfect.With these bottles he's a happy little camper.Sure, there are a few more parts to clean but honestly, it's not that much work.I don't have a dishwasher so I wash everything by hand.That adds up to quite a few dishes to wash at the end of the day.I still don't mind washing the extra parts.I bought a few extra vents, reservoirs, and nipples.That way if I get in a punch where all my bottles are dirty I can wash the bottle and cap really quickly and have extra inside pieces.This usually happens because I push off dishes until I have absolutely no choice but to do them.These bottles come with a brush to wash the inside pieces.I've never had any trouble with leaking.Just remember that you have to use all of the pieces.It just doesn't work that way.They wash up easily with the included brush and a regular bottle brush.My only complaint about these are that they are rather tall bottles and don't easily fit in my travel chill pack.Do NOT listen to the complants of leaks as long as you use all the parts together, this works well and has never leaks.I wish I would have bought these before all the other ones.Yes, there are a number of pieces that have to be cleaned for each bottle, but there are no more pieces than the Born Free bottles, and in the dishwasher it's not a big deal.And even the times I've washed them by hand, having to wash a few pieces and use the enclosed brush hasn't been onerous.If you're instead the type of parent who doesn't mind an extra minute or less loading the dishwasher and an extra 5 seconds in assembling a bottle, if it means your child with reflux will spit up a bit less, I recommend trying one of the Dr. Brown's bottles to see if it helps your baby.It wouldn't make me not buy them (I liked the 4oz so much I just bought the 8oz today and a gift set for a friend), but it's worth noting.They are slightly taller, so they don't fit in smaller travel packs with the nipple attached, but they fit fine in the bottle holders in normal diaper bags.We've only had it for two days and my 21 month old is constantly climbing into it.So far we've made muffins, used the counter to eat breakfast off of, and bathed her newborn baby brother on the island together.Of course it's great to include your kid in whatever activity you're doing since it is the "learning" tower, but sometimes you just need to get the job done and this allows you to do so.I can accomplish so much now while she's happily playing in it.-Good, sturdy, material-The child won't outgrow it for many years-Looks nice in the kitchenCons:-Expensive-My daughter can push it around the kitchen and therefore reach surfaces I'd rather her stay away from.My daughter has gotten out on her own a few times, but usually yells for help.She bends forward onto the platform and just throws her whole body onto it.We left them off and it seems plenty sturdy.Every time I would try to cook, my 16 month old would physically pull me by my thigh away from the counter and demand to be picked up to see what I was doing.We also use it to wash his hands.I have wanted one of these since my oldest son was little(he's 9 years old now!).We have a little one now and have a new home with a big open kitchen, so I figured why not?We won't be selling it anytime soon.We love it!They give you an extra set of allens & extra screws & washers.Instructions are easy to read & follow.My boys really like that part:)These are great for easy cloth diapering.These really hold on the diapers for my squirmy son.Super easy to use, and the 3 pack is great.I use these to secure my son's prefold diapers.They are so easy to use and they really hold.I love these snappis!I have been using these for over a year now and love them!I bought these before I started to diaper my son, thinking pins were intimidating.They worked well enough when my kids were super tiny and in newborn sized prefolds (which you CAN just lay in a wrap but I don't care for that method, though my husband did, which drove me nuts as I would then find myself snappi-less or pin-less out in public when changing a diaper LOL) - since newborns don't move around much, the snappi tended to stay in place.By by and large I prefer my prefolds pinned.You get a more generous fit and a more secure hold, and there's just nothing cuter than a good old fashioned pinned diaper on a naked baby waddling around.A snappi'd diaper just looks odd in my opinion.We use these now to hold diapers on my girls' baby dolls.I use BabyKicks hemp pre-folds and these grip the material very well.Just a few things I'll point out, first emphasizing these are minor issues and I do recommend these to mamas who can't afford fancy pocket diapers but still want ease of use.1.However, this is much less likely to happen than with pins.2.My daughter is exceptionally bright for her age, and could unfasten a disposable or velcro pocket diaper by 4 months old.But once your child gets to that diaper-removing stage, whenever that may be, these don't stand a chance against those wandering fingers.Other than that, we love our Snappis.They are easy to wash, easy to use and take the hard work out of cloth diapering.This is a great diaper pail.Is the system not working correctly?Love the bib, though.Under The Nile is a GREAT brand!However, we do wish they had more toddler sized items.Nevertheless, these bibs are wonderful.These our probably our favorite.They pull over the head like a T-Shirt-- no snaps or buttons, and the coverage is quite ample.They fit our two years old well and the quality is superb.Just got back from a trip to Whole Foods.I purchased this for my little one but for me as well - its just so darn cute!The quality isn't top notch...I have a feeling if I had the right tools and products myself that I could make it, but never the less - its adorable and my baby loves it.You cant tell from the photo but in the center underneath the mobile, are tiny little mirrors so baby loves looking at them!YOu can also take off the little critters so baby will have some additional buddies later on...it also rocks nice and you can use your foot to gently rock it for baby.Last of all the espresso color matches well with my espresso crib set!You don't really need to spend boatloads of money for a good moses basket stand--this one looks great and is really lightweight and easy.The assembly instructions are a little confusing--be sure to read steps 2 and 3 before doing step 2.My 2 yr old daughter outgrew her pack-n-play so I needed another option for traveling and her spending the night at her Aunts house (no spare bed).She has used this air bed twice at her Aunts and she LOVES it.It is also a very good size for camping as it won't take up too much room in our tent.This just showed up, and I opened it up right away to make sure it was okay since we don't plan on needing it for another couple of months.All in all though, looks nice.I'll let my son (2 years old) check it out for a night or two, and then probably put it away.The mattress itself seems sturdy and relatively firm.I'll post an update after we have a chance to actually use it.I purchased the Tyke Light Jr. for my almost 5 yo son when he started to become "scared" of the dark at bedtime.It is a great size, love the auto off feature, and the light is bright enough for him to look at books in bed.Timer works great.Perfect amount of light to be able to see and not keep others up.I love this highchair.Looks great and is very sturdy.We haven't tried it out with food yet.The wheels make it easy to manoeuvre round the house.I have two minor complaints: it's not tall enough for me-I'm 5'6"; and the recline is not the greatest.The instructions say that it's perfect for newborns?!I don't think so, unless your newborn is okay with a 40-45-degree incline and wide chair-back.She has to sit up for 30 minutes after each meal.As with our other Peg Perego products, this high chair is very good, comes highly recommended, has wonderful safety record, but is not perfect.Then again, is there ever a perfect baby product that will please every parent?As the straps are not detachable, I ended up taking the entire chair outside and using the high-power hose spray on those nooks and crannies, giving both the entire chair and myself a nice cool shower.On the other side, the leather had been correctly tucked in and sewn.Updated: 2 months after purchase.My biggest complaint though is the volume level.So we always use the A/C plug because I hate going through batteries.Pros:1)I like you can see your baby's eyes and whether or not they are closed.2)unlike some of the reviews i have not experience crazy static.Having extra bottles is almost a must if you are pumping.This could be the primary reason for my son's immediate acceptance.We are moving in the right direction, so I don't take *too* much issue with it, but I wish there was another "stage" spout yet, so in the near future I could possibly "graduate" my son to a "real" sippy cup (firmer spout).The adult in you will also appreciate that they are almost leak-proof.When tipped on their side or almost upside down, I found a VERY minor drippage; maybe one drop/20 seconds.Yes, I'm very analytical about sippy cups.They go together very easily-- no rocket science here with a million parts or lining things up-- so simple, even a husband can do it ;0) To my disappointment, the spout/nipple frequently collapses when my son is drinking.Also note that it seems these parts are compatible with my Born Free bottles-- we have only used them that way a handful of times, but we did not experience any leaking issues (but the inner BF workings are necessary for tight fit).Note that I bought this conversion kit AND a separate set of Thinkbaby bottles, because the "complete" sippy costs a small fortune from merchants who have it in stock at this writing (2/10).Takes up less space when traveling.I plan to use these with my 4 ounce bottles as baby food jars when my son is old enough for solids.We used a different publisher's "first year" calendar with my older child and loved being able to jot down developmental milestones and other events on it when we were too sleep-deprived to do a good job filling in the fancier baby book.I bought this calendar online for my second child after seeing only the cover.In the age of digital photos, brag books have nearly gone out of fashion.But I tell you, grandma's still LOVE them.Not that my little one's grandma's aren't tech savvy, but they enjoy the feel of carrying this little book around and updating photos of their grandkids.I'm sure by the time I'M a grandma, these will have gone the way of the wind, but for now they are still a nice gift to give...so long as you remember to regular send some prints of those digisnaps you take.Love this cup!I love this cup because it is the perfect combination of being a valve-free cup that is still designed so that water doesn't spill everywhere.The lid fits on tightly and I haven't had leaks there.My son can't get the lid off, but I can for cleaning and refilling.With a valve, the child has to suck rather than sip.The cup is sturdy, washes up great in the dishwasher, and the designs are adorable.My son got these for his second birthday a few weeks ago, and bath time has become exciting again.Now we just have to remind him that there's blocks in the tub waiting for him, and he goes running.These are a huge hit!I actually have to pull my son out of the bath now.I highly recommend these blocks for your little builderThen I went to see a lactation consultant and she showed me this pillow.I do wish it had the little head-rest bumps like the Brest Friend, but I've taken to using a blanket for that and that works just fine.Also, as a bonus the cover is adorable and very, very soft!I even use the bottles at work to keep half & half in- no one ever dares to steal it!No chemicals, sturdy, easy to find a different nipple if the supplied ones don't work for your baby (although I have not had any problem with the Evenflo ones).This, along with the 8 oz version that we also used, is one of those products.When I told my wife how much I loved these bottles, she just shook her head as if to say 'The poor man has gone mental.'Then we considered glass.Sure, if they were dropped far enough on a hard surface, but we decided we'd be careful.These bottles have their gradations formed right into the glass, so they'll wear out when the bottle wears out.I found them to be as sturdy, when using and cleaning them, as our drinking glasses.No parent wants their child to be showered with broken glass, but we came to the conclusion that there was no more to fear from this happening with baby's bottles than with any other glass she is around.Nowadays it's nothing but titanium plates and bowls for her...Value.This one's a biggie.Nothing's too good for my daughter, a sentiment shared by every other parent on earth, I reckon.But these are reasonable.Cool!(yeah, my wife just loves it when I wax enthusiastic about all this)  Most importantly of all, they worked great for our daughter.(there's a shallow groove on the base of the nipples that allows air into the bottle if you don't over-tighten the ring)Are these bottles perfect?Not universally, I'm sure, but they were perfect for us and we'll be using them for our next little one.One nice thing is that you can always change nipples to another brand if baby likes those best or to a different flow rate if necessary.(they come with different flow rates??Who knew?!)There were no real other arguments against glass bottles.I even dropped it down the stairs once, and it also did not break.The nipple on these is also nice.My son has been using these nipples since birth and he is 4 months old now.Wonderful bottles, I would recommend them to everyone.I decided to try the old-fashioned glass bottles like I used as a baby-- back in the olden days (ha!).We love these bottles.I'm nursing and bottle feeding and the low flow nipples are perfect.The measurements are accurate so I know exactly how much I'm transferring into each bag for freezer storage.I started with Avent bottles and made a significant investment with them.I read quite a few reviews before deciding that the Evenflo Classic Glass Bottles would be affordable, easy to clean, and leak-proof.The awesome bottle brushes I'd loved using with the Avent bottles simply would not fit through the narrow bottle opening.I had to find other bottle brushes to clean them.They have a few more parts to clean but they work and my baby is getting formula without air, and no leaks.This is a really nice bonus, we think.+  Value - have you seen the prices that some glass bottles are going for?!These aren't from a company that got into the business of glass bottles because of the BPA scare.Evenflo has been making glass bottles for a long, long time and the value to quality ratio is huge.+  Quality - The nipples that came with these bottles have been great - tough and long-lasting.We also used these for formula on occasion.Highly recommended!The Tilty is great - the effort and motion required for most sippy cups is too much like bottles, I like this cup because it DOESN'T have a valve and is much more like a real glass.Like real cups, it does drip a wee bit, so we use a more traditional sippy cup for car rides (or in any situation where one would use a travel mug).However, it is a perfect cup right before the real thing.My son has a hard time lifting the cup and prefers softer tipped sippy cups.Great design though!I freakin' love these cups!We have tried countless others and he hated them all.Tried this and he drank from it immediately.I love that they aren't 'leak proof'.It will make the transition to a regular cup much easier.Can't live without these!My son likes this cup.I got this changing table for my sister.She absolutely loves the look of it.She hasn't had her kid yet but thinks it will be perfect with the storage and whatnot.I didn't notice any strong smells, although they aren't using the pad since they got a bigger one.This changing table is the perfect piece of furniture for our nursery.The canvas and wood design is a really nice, soft touch...no clattering drawers or loud sounds while changing in the middle of the night.When assembling the table, you will definitely want two adults to help hold the pieces in line while you attach everything.Now we've had this gadget for nearly 6 months, I can write a pretty informative review on this product.First of all, if you can't decide between the Summer Infant over this one, there is only one major determination factor to influence your decision: Do you live in a neighborhood with lots of babies around you?Summer Infant is analog, so if your neighbor has one, they might pick up your imagesOk, now to the pros and cons of this product.Pros:1.Picture quality is awesome.During the day, the color is very vivid.Don't expect to see color at night.There is no color without lights2.Vox feature is great.So the screen is dark.If she cries and the sound exceeds certain level, the picture pops up and you will know she is awake.I absolutely love this feature3.It's nice to have when you need a few extra minutes before you can get to the baby and let the music sooth her.Single best feature: nobody can pick up your images!Cons:1.I don't know why, but my netbook's internet connection will be killed instantly.It's not perfect, but it didn't cost a bundle either.The picture is good.The screen is large enough to see detail.I can see my baby breathing when attached to the crib side.The volume will come on throughout the time it's running, making strange shifts from no sound to a white noise sound.The distance that it gets the camera's signal seems to have shrunk a small amount.Also, there does seem to be some interference with our dual-band wireless internet connection if near a computer that is using it, it may cut out or run slow but not always.We had never used a monitor before and actually bought it for our nanny when we were out of town.Overall, the receiver is great (I was initially worried about the small size but have found that it is just fine and the size of it is convenient) and I do not find that it has static as other posters mentioned.The best part about this monitor is that it doesn't work on frequency so your privacy is maintained and you don't pick up signals from other homes.I don't really use any of the other features like music or VOX.OMG what a difference.this Levana  monitor 1) it does interference with my wireless online, 2) color on monitor sucks, 3) sound sucks.and the picture comes on when he makes sound.the color in the monitor is like blue and white.It is very easily moved, we love that it has a camera.We researched the heck of video monitors before selecting this one.Our #1 concern was compatibility with our home wi-fi network.This system works beautifully in general.Digital signal = no interference, buzzing, crackling, or other sounds.2.I live in a small apartment, and if the units can't "see" each other the camera constantly drops the signal - and makes a very annoying "dropped signal" noise to boot!If this had not been a gift I would definitely return it, and would never buy it again.I recently purchased this for my 2 year old sons room.However, he's recently started coughing at night, and after the doc said his throat was fine, I decided to get a video monitor to see what was going on.And I DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend it to first time parents in the market for a monitor for their soon-to-be-born baby.My main complaint is the sound.This made me very nervous, especially since it didn't come on for everything.I still keep my Bebe Sounds monitor plugged in, and occasionally I'll hear him cough or sneeze, or quietly talking to himself over it, but the Levana didn't pick it up.I heard over my regular monitor my son wake up.Unacceptable if this is your only monitor.Overall, I say PASS.While set up was easy, and the actual image on the screen is of great quality, the unit itself is just too unreliable.If I had starting using this when my son was first born, I would have returned it immediately and bought a better model.I highly recommend looking elsewhere.For well over $100, this unit should be working as well as it did at first for several years, not 75 days.We have used this for 3 months since my son moved out of the bassinet in our room to the crib in his nursery.This monitor was so easy to set up, I just took it out of the box and plugged it in.Don't expect HD TV quality, it's more like a webcam picture.The night vision is great, but the daytime picture is gray looking, but still a clear image.I like that the camera and parent unit have power adapters and the option to use batteries in both.Now on to my favorites of this nifty item!The voice-activated feature is awesome!!!I have never had problem with it not working and I actually find the vox feature quite sensitive to noise.The crib mount has been great because I get a close view of my baby, BUT now that my son rolls around, he partially moves in and out of view of the camera since the camera only covers about 80% of his crib (I placed it on the side of the crib at the very end, so only the 20% area closest to the camera is out of view).It was super easy to set up and the battery life is great.I read the reviews on this seat before making our THIRD purchase.Those are two different styles and Amazon sells both.So to start, we purchased this exact model, different pattern, before our daughter was born in 2008 and used it for our nieces and loved it.Then we purchased another seat, same model, different pattern, in 2009 after she was born and outgrew her child seat.I really wish I'd have read consumer reports first.Then I would have known to REMOVE THE BASE FIRST.My daughter loves the seat, is comfortable and the seat can grow with her.Fastforward, we now have a son and he quickly outgrew his infant seat.So, the moral of the story, read the reviews, pick up a few hints for installation, and install a great quality, safe car seat for your child(ren).We've purchased 3 of this model and if need be we would do it again in a heartbeat.Sidenote: The Triton color is brighter than the picture depicts, and I LOVE it!When rear facing this carseat, it was not secure.It flopped all over the place and I was not comfortable placing my baby girl in it.It is a wonderful car seat!!I can see how it may be a problem rear facing in a small vehicle, but forward facing, it's perfect.The only minor complaint I have is that the harness attaches underneath the car seat and it's a little difficult to get at, because you can't see where you're grabbing.You just have to feel around to unhook the straps.But once I got it unhooked, it was super easy to get it back together.And that didn't distract me from giving it five stars, because the rest of the perks, far outweight that ONE tiny flaw.I got these flashcards for my 6 month old daughter, knowing she was a little young for them.But she LOVES them!Buyers should know that these are not cutesy cartoon pictures, they are real photographs (which I think is more fun and educational anyway).Will definitely use for years to come, I might purchase a second set as a back up.being one of the more unusual ones.My 16-month-old twin girls have not managed to destroy it or even tear a single card in the two or so months that they've had it.My girls love flipping the pages over and over.I bought this when my 2 year old was born, and I've purchased it again for my twins - giving us a total of 6 (we want back-ups).I highly recommend.**Update September 9, 2013** We have now purchased 9 (total) of these over the past 3 years to accommodate our growing family.I still think they're a great value with great function, and I still haven't received even one that smelled funky.I got this for my first son and just recently purchased a 2nd for my second baby.It's waterproof and has a comfortable quilted layer for the baby.I love this pad.Item arrived quickly and was pretty much as described.I bought two, and both were just a touch too small for the sealy crib mattress.I had to really force the corners.I am pleased with this mattress pad.It survived our washer and drier just fine.And I put it on the mattress without ripping anything.It's a perfect fit for the mattress I have.Overall I am very pleased with it.It is lightweight, so it can be quickly grabbed out of the trunk, it pops open and locks with just one hand, the car seat rests on the stroller quickly and easily, and easily secures with the red straps.It also easily folds with one hand (the right hand - due to the orientation of the release button).The basket underneath is very roomy.Best thing about it, I don't feel like I'm pushing around a Suburban like some of these other travel systems I see mothers pushing around.Now it just keeps falling off and we are back at square one left to find a new safety lock.I came across this while searching for a pacifier holder, but thought it was INGENIOUS that they would attach a pacifier to a stuffed animal for the baby to hold.He already liked the SOOTHIE pacifiers so it wasn't a big deal.Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.It's been great not to have to worry as much about pacis falling on the floor.I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more "beans" or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.As soon as my son started teething, all paci's went out the window.It arrived in lesss than a week from the date of order and fits in the crib perfectly.I am happy with this purchase.She often waked up during the night crying because of the uncomfortable bedding.After she was on the mattress with a sturdy crip(both was purchased at Amazon.com), she didn't wake up during the night.Moreover, the item is reasonable in its price and showing good performance up to now.This is the only crib mattress I've owned, so I don't have anything to compare it to (and of course I personally have never laid on it).But this works perfectly for us.I don't notice any indentations or anything like that where my baby lies.And it fit our crib perfectly with no spaces between the mattress & crib.I would definitely buy this again if I had to do it over.UPDATE:  My son is now 21 months old and the mattress is still holding up just fine... still no indentations in it.I like that it's waterproof, as he's had a few nights where he has soaked his diaper, pajamas & sheets, so while I have to wash all of that at least I don't have to worry about the mattress at all.I wanted to make sure I got a mattress from a Company that knew what they were doing.I researched many different models, and of course as a new parent that I am, I wasn't going to hold back on price for the mattress on which my fragile baby was going to sleep in.I wanted something safe above all and well constructed.So for new parents that is pretty cool if you are planning on having more babies.It is very well constructed and it is quite firm, just perfect for a newborn.At least on my Emily crib, it fits perfectly.I can't be more happy...above all, Baby loves it!For $97 it is a STEAL!I highly recommend it.I did notice that there was an indentation where his head always laid, but we switched sides and the indentation seemed to go away, so that seems to be a non-issue.The playtex were spill proof as well and did hold up other than the chewed up sippy cup look!The Phillips Avent has lasted longer and still looks brand new even with him chewing on it.The top lid, I will agree was a pain but if you just take it off it's still spill proof and works!Wasn't painful at all and I never used the petals that came with it.It was also very powerful.I started to use it again when I had my second daughter a few weeks ago and all of a sudden the motor went kaput.My other complaint is that it is not compatible with the Born Free bottles even with their adaptor :(.I recommend it widely.Got this for our first baby and it seems to work great.I researched a fair amount but I bought because of the Philips name, the let down features, and the compactness of the package.This also means that it is completely safe to hand down to your friends and families, or obtain a used one, without fear of contamination.2)  The shield size is slightly larger than the standard medela and slightly smaller than the 27 mm, which is a good size for me.3)  I really love the petal inserts - that is why the manual Avent is the best manuel I have ever used (and I have tried a lot).4)  Being able to control the suction speed also allows you to some degree control the suction strength.I actually bought this based on the reviews here on Amazon and in the Baby Bargains book.The mm size with the petal insert is a standard 24 mm.If you take the petals out the funnel becomes a 27mm size.I need the 24 mm size, but don't like using the petals.I wish Avent made different sized funnels.Yes, it works, I just wish they made different funnel sizes.This has been my lifesaver for almost a year now.It's very quiet and I like the fact that I can adjust the rhythm and suction strength.It's easily portable and I appreciate the manual pump that's included, as it makes a good option when you can't just plug in the electric one.(My sister in law had a Medela pump that starting growing mold when they rinsed it out instead of using the dishwasher.)This would work in a boy's or girl's room.For the price of this hamper, I would not have purchased it knowing that I would have to sand it myself or risk injury to my child.This hamper is great though!It comes with a white mesh laundry bag inside, and it is very strong.Soft fabric, adorable fawn on the front really helps keep my granddaughter's set 'enchanting.'However, it's not very sturdy.We can hold her on it and bounce her up and down, but it's not sturdy enough to hold her up.She really likes him though, and gives him kisses daily.Nothing is different between the times it works and doesn't, as far as assembly or usage.This seriously has to be one of the items I am most thankful for.My baby is almost 5 months old and I dont use it as much now but it was def one of those items where I got my moneys worth.My only thing is (and this is a personal preference and by no means an issue with the pump itself) is that I dont like to use plastic bottles but luckily I have chicco glass bottles that attached to this pump perfectly.Love it.she recommended electric, which is what i'm hoping to get soon.So we had this on our registry and was a gift.The Free Flow works well and there is absolutely no leakage.I have tried many "tricks" and nothing works consistently.I received these as a gift & when I couldn't breastfeed resorted to using them.My baby has done great with these!Best of all, there aren't tons of parts to clean or inserts to fuss with!**UPDATE** Still like the look & feel of these bottles BUT they DO leak a TON!!!It's a huge pain.we bought these from amazon and from toysrus.still did not help.My sister bought the same bottle design, also avent, from france.She paid even less and they are BPA -free.I like the avent nipples and brand but it doesn't seem too challenging or demanding to request a bottle that doesn't need tricks in order not to leak all over your child's outfit, your couch, your outfit and whatever else might be around.I didn't receive the powder dispenser with my set.I bought it separately and really like it because it can be used as a snack dispenser later on.Also, I bought 2 more level 1 nipples since our baby gags on the level 2 medium flow nipples.So we still use the avent bottles but I use all of my other bottles first.I just bought playtex ventaires (wide bottles with slow flow nipples) and I love them.Do not buy these bottles unless your babies can absorb formula through their skin.Further, the bottles are not finely graded, so when you are trying to keep track of how much a newborn is eating, it's not very accurate.This sterilizer is compact and conienient for travel.I love this setThis sterilizer is GREAT.water, put in the items to be sterilized then put it in the microwave for 4 min.wait another 2 minutes then open up the top.I shake off the water on the items then leave it to dry.If you were to buy all these items separately, you would probably pay around $20 more, possibly even more that that depending on where you buy them.Anyway, I am now using the Playtex Drop-In system and this sterilizer works great for that too.The scrubber and snack jar are nice additions as well.This works as a great gift too.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is quiet big on the outside for a newborn's face, I wish the round part was a little smaller for their tiny faces.But it is a great paci to have in the beginning, give it a try.might work, but my baby didn't accept any pacifier at all!I also tried a Avent model, but she didn't accepted too.These are simply great.Our son much prefers them to the old style with a plastic ring around the edge.I'm not a big fan of color stereotyping for babies--I am a man who's favorite color is and always has been purple--so we were happy enough to buy this for use with our son.He has one 'boy' pack and one 'girl' pack, giving him a nice diversity of colors to choose from.We'll let him decide as he grows older what colors he prefers.These are great for any baby, boy or girl.Once our son's first tooth came in we always worried that he might bite through but even the oldest set has held up.Perfect.I decided it was time to give him something that he could really practice gripping and moving from one hand to the next so I went to our local toy store for recommendations.The Skwinkle came highly recommended and my son has loved it.The red band is visually stimulating for him and easy for him to grip in his small hands.She said that even though this toy was made in China, she has a lot of respect for and faith in the Manhattan Toy company.I bought this to use with breastmilk for my baby at daycare.I don't have large breasts or nipples, so this definitely helps prevent nipple confusion.I used these with my son in 2007(Oh this account is in my husband's name BTW) and he breastfed just fine, I used  Philips AVENT with my daughter in 1998, b/c these weren't invented yet, and she refused to brestfeed after having one bottle.I came back to order some more for my next baby due in October!Everyone in my family laughed at these bottles b/c of the two nipple design, but who cares-they work!My only complaint is that they leave a slight film (but I guess that's to be expected, with food-grade ingredients).They also dry out easily, but are still definitely worth having.These are great for a quick clean-up when pumping on the go.A few days after I started breastfeeding, my nipples were cracked and so painful I cried while feeding.I got this stuff and they started feeling better the next day.I suffered through early nipple cracks with nothing, then used shields, then went shield-free and started using Lanisoh.But the Lanisoh is so dense it's painful to apply even after warming it between your fingers.Honestly, I don't really know if either work all that well.While breastfeeding, I felt like I hurt all the time whether I used this stuff or not.My daughter will take this bottle from my husband-we give her about one a day so that when I go back to work, she will have practice.However, I can't say she particularly loves the bottle.It takes her a long time to drink from it...The lactation consultant I saw recommended this brand since it is closest to the breast.I bought this bottle thinking it would be the solution to my breastfed daughter not taking any bottles.That said the bottle is fine.My only thought about those that are complaining about it, they must NOT have read the directions at all.Just make sure to read the directions when getting the milk from the nipple to the bottle.Also in reference to those complaints about cleaning the bottle a simple solution I used is to have a small bowl of warm water that I soak the bottle in before I clean it, that way the milk does not get crusted on there...so I also had NO issued with cleaning the nipple either.At first, I was very impressed that they improved her latch and she didn't appear to have much gas from taking the bottle.The outer, clear nipple was still in perfect shape but the inner, blue nipple was deteriorating.I told her that I was using a nipple brush to clean the inside of the nipples but that there was no other way to get to the very tip of the inside.What works for one baby may not work for another.My daughter hated this bottle.She was breastfed, but used to a bottle from the very first day of life.She took just about anything you put in her mouth, but she hated this one.I tried it a few more times and it just wasn't worth it.These bottles are great!My son used then until 11 months.But this bottle looks very cheap and a lead has rough edges.But it looks like it might work as described.Just read the directions and you too will fall in love with this bottle system.At 6 weeks, it looks like we're going to have to go from "slow" to "medium" flow, because my son is collapsing the outer chamber, but I like this best of the 3 I've tried.I bought these for our son's (4 months)pacifiers and small toys.We travel alot and are at A LOT of outdoor events that don't always have a convenient place to wash dropped items off.They do leave a bit of an after taste on the items.The package fits well in the diaper bag and has a great closure on it so that the wipes don't dry out.I think a baby wipe would probably do the same job as these wipes but I do like them...not sure I will buy another pack thoughThese pacifier wipes are great.We initially received as a shower gift and bought more when we ran out.Highly recommend!These wipes are great!These wipes are great for travel, however, they are a bit expensive and small.A child in anything but a prone position will have trouble.2.This makes the child have to position it in an uncomfortable way, which leads to them giving up on the training too quickly.3.Can't really bend or compress, and is weirdly shaped.You'll be happy you did!I added some photos, so you can see what they look like on an actual wall.I would recommend checking the price periodically before buying these, as they often go for 25% off list price.In relation to the other wall decals out there these are a bargain.The pictures do not do the decals justice as they are large.My son has been using this for quite awhile.It works great... well built, does the job (just works), reliable, no problem.I think someone else mentioned the glowing... don't expect much of it though, if it does glow it's not to bright, but nonetheless it serves it purpose very well if you don't expect too much from the "glow feature".My sister-in-law bought this shampoo rinse cup, which I've had the chance to try out whenever we visit my mother-in-law.When my daughter was younger, I couldn't quite get her to look all the way up, so I had to resort to other methods of washing her hair.Nowadays, she will look up, but the seal is in tatters, so water gets in her face unless I position it far enough back, in which case, I might as use a regular cup or a small bucket.Inside the cup is a wall between the front and back of the cup.I'm not sure what that is for, except maybe so the water can came out more gently?At first glance, this lock appears a little cheap.However, it does function nicely.Second, the cable release button should lock when the cable is locked, and it does not.It would be nice if they had designed this button to lock when the combination is scrambled.The seat belt straps drive me insane.No way to adjust it smaller.My daughter LOVES to sit in this.It folds really small and is airline carry on sized, but we just checked it plane side.The sun shade is detachable and you can buy different soft seats for them... at least the 3 wheeled Zapp you can (only in the UK).It takes a while to get used to the folding/unfolding process- 1,2,3.All in all it's a great stroller but it has a few minor flaws with the seat belt and it not reclining, this is a great buy.Ours is nice and tight in the suv...not gonna slide around at all.This is a critical part of parenthood...installing this car seat properly :)I saw some complaints about children sweating in this car seat?This is an awesome car seat!I also bought with this the stroller frame and the lite rider stroller.I recommend only getting one or the other, I prefer the lite ride since it is compatible with the car seat and can be used for walks without the car seat.We've never had anything become loose or break on it.- Buckling the baby in the seat is fast and relatively easy.- We haven't been in an accident with it, but based on the quality of the construction it looks like it would fare well.- The front adjusting belt makes it easy to adjust the straps to fit over his jacket.Cons:- It is a LARGE seat!- We've had problems when going to restaurants fitting it into the booths.Sometimes we just have to put him on the floor, out of the way.- Some shopping carts don't accept the large size either and I have to set it in the actual cart.It won't fit behind either of our seats.The only way we can fit it in, is to secure it to the middle seat.- The straps need to be longer.At 7 months, the straps started to seem like they were getting too short.We adjusted the straps so that they were as far out as they could go.Even though the seat should be able to accommodate a larger child as it claims (32" and 32 lbs), the straps are either too short or not high enough to accommodate a larger child.We're always pulling them out from under him to put him in.- Adjusting the straps is well documented in the instructions, but unfortunately not very easy.We took our Preemie twin girls home when they were around 6 lbs.Now the 32's make it so you don't have as much room in the front seats.My son is 21 pounds at 8 months and we've pretty much maxed out on this seat.I was hoping to use it until the one year mark, but there is no chance because the straps are way too short.I would have bought a less expensive seat if I knew that it wouldn't make it to the 32 pound mark.So if you are a tall couple with a small backseat, this carseat may cause problems for you.But with the stroller frame, I still give this 5 stars.The other travel system I considered (it had a lightweight stroller frame) was recalled due to safety issues, so again, 5 stars for Graco.The other thing that is great about this system is that unlike many systems, the carseat and stroller frame are sold separately, which meant both items were bought off my registry and given to me by two different people.My son is in the 95th percentile for height and weight, and since he's about 30.5 inches at 12 months we are switching to a "big boy" seat (not a Graco, had to find something smaller so he can ride rear facing for a while longer) and I really am sorry to have to retire this product.and you can use the carseat without the base, there are instructions in the book telling you how to, so indeed a second base isn't nessesary.Good luck.Update...My girl is now almost 7 months old...The idea behind this carseat is a great one--not having to get another seat for a while was why I chose this seat.However, it is heavy, bulky and the baby sweats everytime he is in it.We were deciding between the Chico, Britax and Graco 30+ lb rear facing seats.It was less expensive and provides excellent safety and our son has been quite comfortable in it.Easy to get in and out of the base.It is also an approved car seat for our Bob Revolution stroller - which we use daily (the Chico is not).We are hoping to use this rear facing until he is 32lbs or 32 inches (current AAP recommendations state that children should remain rear facing until as close to 2 years as possible).We will then purchase the Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 or Britax Frontier which both go from front facing car seat to booster (up to 100 lbs).Positives: 1.Our son really sleeps well in it.The seat is very safe by all standards of safety.The fabrics and look of the seat are really nice.Seat takes up so much room in the backseat that the frontseat is really crunched.It often wakes our son when he is sound asleep.Surely there is a way to make that sound softer.The seat is very difficult to remove from the base.Here is why:positive:* HUGE #1: The Snugride line was rated TOP for safety in Consumer Reports for infant car seats!!This means if we would  have bought the snugride (regular), he would have outgrown it at 6 months.* Yeah, the seat itself it is heavier.Can't see how the 32 would work in a sedan.* The seat is heavier.I would never do this anyways-- too unstable and dangerous in my opinion.* You can't fit this carseat into many restaurant booth seats.I purchased the Snugride 32 beforehand after doing a lot of research.I read other people's opinions and, based on their thoughts, concluded that it would be best to purchase the 32 because I would be able to use it for one year or up to 32 pounds.I had a feeling he might be big, which is why I bought this seat.The straps are way too short.My son was maxed out within the first couple of months.Why don't they make the straps longer?It is a very tight fit.I am giving the seats two stars because it looks nice (I have the Rittenhouse and get many compliments on the nice black and white pattern), seems to work fine and was comfortable for the baby in the first few months.If you have a big baby, you will have to do this anyway, whether you buy the 32 or not because the 32 can't accommodate a very large baby.We've been using this seat for 8 months now and love it.It is also true that the straps are too short to keep them out of the way.We used it in the summer and didn't find she got any hotter than normal.We bought it mainly for the white noise but there are also a few nature sounds, heartbeat, and you can plug your small mp3 player in at the bottom and use it as a speaker.It is also nice and compact, so you can bring it when you travel and it does not take up a large amount of space on our nightstand.A common problem is that the connectivity of the power cord to the machine is very sensitive.It's cheap and dingy!2.As a bonus, I can use the remote control to control the sound too!I bought this sound machine before my daughter was born and had to return it because it was stuck in the "on" position and wouldn't turn off unless I unplugged it from the wall.So, we got a replacement and it works okay... for the most part.In order to shut it off, I need to plug it back into the wall and turn it off.I do love the variety of sounds available- we found the perfect one for our daughter.I like that in addition to the white noise it has an option to add a heartbeat sound that seems like they are in the womb.It is light and compact, much smaller than I thought it would be.Other than that It's perfect for my family.This high chair went together easily (Okay, you have to read the directions), is super comfortable for my daughter, and is VERY easy to clean!you have to take it completely off to take your child out..my sister has a different graco one & you can slide out the tray to the last position & take baby out with out removing the tray which is rea;;y nice.when fully reclines you can just push it staight up with out using the button!For the most part, it is an asset.With this, you get a changing table that you can add to the side and it works like a charm.We live in a small apartment and we use this pack and play as our babys crib.The top basinet is great for when the baby is younger.We used the changing table the first couple months of our babies life and it worked good.I would highly recommend this pack and play.I spent an incredible amount of time choosing a pack and play.The changing station is amazing!It has three pockets that hold all of the necessary items for the sometimes interesting events that happen there.The bassinet feature is nice as well.It is really fun to watch him make his way around that area.We haven't packed it up yet since it has served as our downstairs changing area since he was born, but we are sure that it will travel well.This is a well-designed pack and play.This was a great alternative.Our son likes the music and falls asleep easily when we use it.-The diaper changing station that attaches to the side has been a real life-saver, making late night diaper changes easy.We are using this as the primary bed for our little one until his furniture arrives and it is working really well.The all-in-one convenience of the changing table and bassinet are tremendous for those late night diaper changes.This is a great looking Pack 'N Play, which is what drew me in to start with, then I read about all the features, and liked it even more and went ahead and registered for it.Now that our little guy is 6 weeks old, I'm ready to review.The appearance was true to the photos and pleasing.The colors are great.Chocolate brown goes well too -- Carter's makes a great quilted one (Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Chocolate)!And now for the features --1) Changing table = awesome.There are three pockets for storing necessary items on the side -- a large wipes container fits well in the center, and diapers and creams/sprays/etc fit in the other two.I have not had any problems with the changing table becoming crooked or non-level, as others have commented -- and it's been our primary changing table, since we're in the process of moving.It says to wipe it down with a damp cloth or the like.So air-pees get them good and soaked, and it's hard to remove stubborn diaper cream that may have been kicked there by an irritated baby or spilled there by an exhausted parent.2) "Soothing vibration" for the bassinet -- very nice, but we've used it a LOT and it no longer works reliably.We can't seem to find the loose connection, either.Jiggling the switch, the connection to the switch, or the unit itself has only inconsistent results.We were able to quiet it down by placing a folded cloth between the vibrator and the mattress.I'm not sure I'd recommend this though, as adding extra thermal insulation over even a battery powered electric item may be a bad idea.3) Nature sounds and music -- nice, but quite low volume.It sits on a sort-of hammock-like support that you drape and secure over the top of the crib-like unit, and extends the full length/width of the Pack 'N Play.Standard portacrib mattresses seem to be just slightly off, leaving enough of a gap that we, as first time paranoid parents, were not comfortable with.OVERALL -- It's a great Pack 'N Play if a Pack 'N Play is what you want/need.Also note that as others have pointed out, this Pack 'N Play does not fit through a standard doorway when fully open/set up.This was given to us as a shower gift.The carseat seems very comfortable and the stroller is a Cadillac.While the stroller is very cushy, it is HUGE.We have an SUV and it takes up most of the back.It has a nice sized basket on bottom and 4 cup holders (a little excessive to me).Overall a nice set, just be prepared for the size of the stroller.My child would wake up instantly upon shutoff and did not enjoy being in the toy awake.Definately much better 'bouncy' chairs out there with more features for a substancially less cost.This is ok UNLESS you have a small infant, or if the plush insert doesn't fit quite right, the baby's neck can actually get bent enough to suffocate.So if your baby starts kicking, get them out of there right away, or there's a good chance s/he can get a bruised heel or a toe bent backwards.It was perfect for the newborn baby.I wish there was a model that also was the "bouncy" type.My granddaughter's nursery is on a lamb theme in white and taupe, so this product line was perfect.I really wish we had a bought a more traditional type of bouncy seat.That can't be fun for him.I bought this b/4 I had my daughter.I would go for something that is a little more entertaining...maybe then you could get a shower AND dry your hairWe purchased this seat for our son because he loved being in his FP Precious Planet bouncer so much.Our son outgrew this seat (lengthwise), but he still uses his bouncer daily.It holds doesn't hold his attention too long, but you have to expect that with babies.I personally love that this playmat is so easy to throw in the wash and washes up very well.We have a spitter, so that's a very positive quality in this house!I agree with the users so far that this is a great little gym.It's very easy to assemble.It is sturdy.Infants could lie on a blanket with infant toys.We have the matching bouncer, which he loves as well.This one (if you read other reviews) has an issue with the motor for the snow globe, it is very noisy.The music is alright, it's colorful, good bounce.My guy loves the penguin and it bobbles easily whenever he moves a little in the chair (he doesn't need to bounce much at all) so that is nice.I don't think the snow globe is great, how enjoyable is looking at a non-moving panda and some tiny white balls flying about (can they even see it?Of all the baby items we have, this is the one that probably gets the most use.It still looks great after several washings.My son LOVES this.And -- very importantly -- it washes so, so well.It always comes out of the dryer (after only a brief spin) looking good as new, and the fabric has never stained.It's a little deeper than the others we've seen, with higher sides, so our son seems (to us) to be more secure.The seat is positioned deeply enough that he's able to really move his legs, which isn't the case with others we've tried.The weight balance makes us more comfortable picking up the seat with our son in it than we do with other bouncers.The safety restraint is excellent.And, most importantly, my son can really make himself BOUNCE in this thing!!I rolled a burp diaper up under his toush and was able to let him use it through about 24.5inches.He's now 19weeks and a hair over 25inches and we only really use it to stage his bath towels for whoever is pulling him from the bath.My little man hated the swing and fusses with the car seat.we have this potty and have been using it over a year.it's great for my son.I recommended it to a friend and her son has done well with it too.We are really happy with this frog potty from Fisher Price.Most potties just seemed like a lot of work with various pieces that would have to be dismantled and cleaned off.My son (2 years old) was even able to lift it out easily, carry it to the potty and dump it without a problem.He also liked it better, as he would tell the singing potty to "be quiet" all the time.He also thought it was cute and funny.:)  I think to make it wider the back rest would be too far away and he'd just keep scooting back anyway.So it's fine the way it is.The other potty was messy to clean and had no "pee-pee" guard for boys (so we were constantly cleaning up spills and oopsies).My only wish is that it was a little more comfortable for her.We've only used this for a day but I can tell my son is very comfortable on it.I love that it's easy to clean, very cute, and looks comfortable.The back is high enough where my son can lean back and rest and the front is high enough to prevent "spraying".We bought this for our 18 month old son to start getting him used to the idea of a potty.He is obviously too young for formal potty training, but we encourage him to sit on it and such.This would make it easier for him to get on and off.Our son loves the frog design, so that is a plus since it engages him more than a plain seat.So I narrowed the potty choices down to 3 different potties.Fisher Price Princess Potty, Fisher Price Cheer For Me Potty, and the Fisher Price Frog Potty.I loved the height of this potty and that it was fairly lightweight yet sturdy and that the back rest actually stayed up.The reason I was looking for another potty was to keep her out of the bathroom after my bathroom had been "T.P.One huge issue I kept seeing in other potties was that the basin/bucket would be flush with the surrounding seat so if a little rogue urine got on the seat part, it could get elsewhere through the crack between basin/seat.Even the ones wit ha seat top completely over the basin, urine can still get under the seat, meaning more to clean.The Frog Potty is one piece on the top with a built in urine guard.My 2.5 year old daughter has only had this potty 2 days now and she already lifted it up after using it, carried it carefully to the bathroom, was even able to lift the toilet lid on her own, and dump the contents in, all by herself!The bucket/basin part of this potty is large enough for all kids urine, however, I wonder if it could fit a fairly decent sized poopie without hitting the bottom before it's out of the kids' hiney.If you lift out the pink (or blue) basin, there is nothing underneath - therefore, to extend the life of this potty, you could easily fit a 1 gallon ice cream bucket underneath the frog and it perfectly fits around the hole that the basin sits in.(See picture)The Pink/green version's colors are a lot more subtle than the Blue/green version where the green is a vibrant green.Both are pretty and I had a hard time deciding which color!!So far, we love the simplicity, cute factor, and comfort at a fraction of the price of other potties!!I don't find my daughter particularly large but the other potty would leave a red ring on her bum and sometimes the white insert would come up with her.I brought it home and she absolutely loved all the songs it sang.We have no problem with the ring around the bum on this one.POSITIVE FEEDBACK: She knows the songs by heart and really looks forward to that positive feedback on her accomplishments.We've had our hippo for maybe a year now, and we're pleased with it.She loves things that look like other things, so the stool with the hippo face is perfect for her.its compact and doesnt take up much space.I recently bought this booster seat to leave at my in-law's where they care for my 5 months old daughter.We decided to purchase another one so we don't have to deal with taking it back and forth.This booster seat has many pros: it's cute, seems to be comfortable, easy to use, seatbelt is adjustable, sturdy, and easy to clean.I think they're great but my 7 month old daughter is not too amused.the controls weren't screwed up!!My son is 10 pounds.I do like the colors and the cute lion.I must say it is great.My baby loves it and when used with Duracell batteries it works for many road trips.It is very roomy and comfortable.Great item!My baby loves this!I bought this for my 3 month old son.Other reviewers said their children played in it once they were able to hold up their heads, but my son didn't do well in it all for 2 months.You can set the music to reward the baby for jumping or continuous play, which I love.It takes up a little bit of room but we keep ours in our living room so we can always be around when he plays.BOTTOM LINE: I love this now that my son is enjoying it, too.It takes up space, and I won't lie about it.It doesn't collapse like the other ones, but it's certainly much more sturdy.Nevertheless, we have the space and we can easily put our son into this jumperoo and we can have dinner or any other meal without our son getting cranky or needy - he'll quietly and independently play in it for sometimes up to an hour.The best part of it, is that it gets our son enough excercise where he'll jump and tire himself out before bedtime.Our son gets a lot of exercise and has very strong legs from all the jumping (very muscular legs), and not only crawls at 6 months, but is lifting himself to the standing up position while holding onto everything.This is the best and most useful toy I've purchased so far into the 6 months we've had our son.Although it takes most babies a "warming up" period with any toy, our son got right into this toy as soon as we took it out of the box.I purchased this mobile and love how it helps entertain my daughter so she stays awake longer during the day (and is not awake at night) and falls back to sleep when she cries in the middle of the night.but after 2 month, he enjoyed watching the projector, so I used this many times everyday.my baby usually loved to look at this.Its easy to install and does the trick.We purchased this when our son was about a month old - he is 2 and a half and still uses it!I have to say, I don't think we have anything we bought for his nursery (aside from blankets) that we still use regularly.PROS:The sounds (three to chose from) play for 20-minutes, then you can use the remote to re-activate it (which means not getting up, ahhh what relief that is).You have the option of just playing music, doing music and the canopy, OR doing music, canopy AND projection.It offers a lot of features that make it useable beyond infancy into at least the next year.I love this mobile or rather I should say, my son loves this mobile and in turn I love it too.It has really helped me get him to calm down when going down for a nap.I love the projected image and the fact you can take the mobile part off.I love the remote.I also love that it is easy for my son to turn on.Almost every day he wakes up, turns the mobile on and then just waits for me to come and get him.I highly recommend getting rechargeables and having two rotating sets to save money.I do recommend this mobile but take these points in to consideration when deciding if it is right for you.We love this mobile!A parent definitely created this.A parent knows that one music choice is not enough, and this has three options.A parent knows that not every child will want the projection, mobile and music, so we can chose to have one, two or all three play.A parent knows that some babies prefer louder music, while others prefer a softer volume, this has two settings.A parent knows that eventually the longest of mobiles will stop moving, this mobile has a remote control- that works!This is a lightweight blanket that's for hotter climates.Compared to the Aden and Anais, this swaddling blanket is not as soft or stretchy.This is by far my favorite summer swaddling blanket.We joke our son is "Houdini" for his ability to get out of smaller swaddling blankets, and this is the perfect size to keep him in.I wouldn't want to use a heavier weight blanket of this size with a shirt in the summer, he'd be too hot.I LOVE this blanket and am getting more.We love the swaddle blankets by swaddle designs.First they are huge!Second, the marquisette is nice and light for the summer months - you won't baby about baby getting over heated.Third, you can get a very nice, tight swaddle from the blanket - as it is stretchy.I didn't want to get a swaddle blanket with velcro strips and just got these blankets.They are great!I have this item in the kiwi circles, and it is my absolute favorite summer swaddling blanket!I've found that putting my son in a long sleeve shirt prevents him from wiggling free and also makes him the perfect temperature.this was our go to blanket for the first 3 months, can't live without it.This is by far my favorite summer swaddling blanket.It is the perfect size to keep my son in, and I use it with a long sleeved shirt to prevent arm escape!It's the perfect weight for summer and I could not put him to bed without it.My son didnt really care for them.She likes the firefly better than "Princess Sophie", but she does play with both.I have used it with both my children and I would recommend it to any parent.My babies were perfectly comfortable in it and it secures the baby to your body in a way that gives you the security to free both your hands.The adjustable straps at the top allow you to pull their head closer to you for extra support, and when the baby is older you can flip the top down and turn the baby around and let them enjoy the view.I bought this for our second baby, and I love it!its one of the best front carriers I have ever owned.I owned a few different ones for our first child and all them dissappointed.It comfortable for me - but of course, any sling/wrap gets somewhat uncomfortable after an extended period of time.Still, it works perfectly both wearing the baby inward and outward.This item is so cute and very entertaining to little ones.This bouncer entertains her and my son.She just loves it.My son, who is 3 years older, loves to play with her on the toys available in this baby bouncer activity center.It helps her cope with the fact that she is not getting picked up as often and being held.It's so perfect.The bouncer part is adjustable, good for growth.My mother bought this for my 4 month old son.Unfortunately she pushed down the spring/accordion part and it pinched her hand.I bought this item to keep in my office for my 5 month old when I bring him to work with me.It is much more compact than some of the saucers (which I like for a smaller space).The toys and colors are great and you can always attach more.It doesn't bounce like a jumper, but does a little bit.Overall it is a great product for a relatively low price!I did have to put a towel under mine for the rear facing position and it seems perfectly safe.Others mentioned that it doesn't have the 2 reclining positions and mine did not either but it seems to recline rather nicely rear facing.My daughter is on the 3rd slots but I think she'll be able to use it for a few years before she's too tall.The strap adjuster is very easy to use and I don't have to fight with the straps at all.Sometimes the straps twist but I have had this happen with many other seats as well.My daughter seems very comfortable in this seat.She has slept many times and doesn't ever complain.I love that they are removeable and washable.It is very inexpensive and seems to be just as nice as the $300 ones.I hope that others will give it a try.It opens and closes with ease for quick transport.Would be much better if the legs expanded for height adjustment.All in all, a great find.This will also be a nice spare high chair - all around great item!Small footprint even with the tip proof legs.Could be a little taller, but works (Slightly taller than an average adult chair).Sturdy and easy to put together.Press the red notch levers and pull back to adjust again.After the first position the tray does rub the fabric a little which will probably be the first wear spots after a few years.From the start, my son found so many things he loved on it.I love the height adjustment on it and it's easy to adjust.When my baby stands up at it, I have to hold the activity center down because the legs are too far apart to make it sturdy.This exersaucer is awesome!!!My 4 month old son loves it.Our favorites are the globe that plays music and the singing chameleon.The alligator is also great but I do agree with many of the other reviews that once the pieces are knocked off it is impossible for the child to put them back in their place.One does absolutely nothing, and one is way too difficult for my son to make squeak on his own (heck it's even difficult for me sometimes lol) the middle one is the only one that he interacts with out of those three.I am interested to see how stage 3 goes as we have only used stage 1 and 2 so far.I bought this Exersaucer last Xmas, as a present for my 4 month old baby, a year has pased and I still have it on my living room... my son love it!She is extremely rough on it.She loves the little bee that you can pull out and it buzzes on it's way back in.She does not yet seem interested to make it walk in a circle, but she can make the seat spin 360 degrees now.This entertains her anywhere from 5 minutes up to 30 minutes once or twice a day.My twin girls have been using this exersaucer for two months now.They seem to enjoy it, although, not as much as their Baby Einstein Jumperoo.The toys on the Garden Exersaucer are moderatly fun and visually stimulating.The tree is the best feature with lots of buttons and ways to interact.I'm going to get my husband to sand down the edge.My babies have hit themselves in the face more than once after pulling the toy to hear it buzz.Not cool.I probably would buy something else given the chance again.I bought this yesterday and will be returning it today, it is awful!I have installed it exactly as specified by Evenflo and no matter how I adjust it the gate seems to have 2 settings:  1) No possible way to open it or 2) opens if my baby leans on it.This gate is VERY sturdy (note: we did NOT use the extension...some gates become less sturdy once you use the extension).It's very easy to open with just one hand.Some people mentioned they had trouble opening the gate.Once you learn how to open the gate, it's easy!I've had this gate for a few weeks and am very pleased.When I saw this gate at such a reasonable price I quickly bought it and have been very happy with my purchase.It opens easily with one hand and the vertical bars make it impossible for my eleven month old son to climb.I was a bit surprised that the gate was taupe, I expected it to be white, but it is a very nice color.As a side note, this gate also successfully restrains my 120 Great Dane when necessary.I bought this gate because my sister has the same and hers seemed to work great.Plus, as far as baby gates go, it wasn't that appealing.I ended up selling this one and going with the Dreambaby pressure mounted gate.That particular gate is much more appealing visually and much easier to open than the Evenflo.I purchased 2 gates from Amazon, this one from Evenflo, and the Summer Tall Infant Gate.This one i bought so i can take with me when I go to my parents house.But if your looking for a gate thats easy to set up, take down, and travel with, this would be the gate for you.And if your looking for a sturdy gate that stays put, ill recommend the Summer walk through gate.We were given an Evenflo gate as a hand-me-down and we were pretty impressed with it despite it being several years old (at least 5 - maybe closer to 10).We have used it in both of the larger openings that we have in our house and we just love it!And we prefer this color over the navy blue on the older one.This gate is very sturdy and we are using it almost at its max length.Very easy to install.Highly recommended!This gate fits the extra wide space that we purchased it for, but the latches for extending the bars to the walls are under the fabric and hard to latch and unlatch.We had already owned an older version of this gate for our older kids and decided to go with it again.The new model has more neutral colors (the old model was purple and white) and with a greyish mesh does not show dirt.It holds in place well and expands to be used with many different sized openings, a big plus for a military family that moves to a new house every couple years.It's a great price for a gate that fits a wide space between rooms.The downsides are not deal breakers in any way.Being fabric with a mesh gate area there can be snags that happen, our old one was used for several years and ended up with a handfull of small snags in the fabric over that time.We tried using this gate to block our 1 year old son from the kitchen... but since it's a fabric gate, he was able to "push" and curve the gate.We have a new puppy and want to keep her confined to the kitchen.There is a 5' wide opening between the kitchen and the living room.I'm a bit concerned about my puppy tearing the mesh but so far that hasn't been a problem.However, the little rubber ends that go on the wall/frame caused the paint to crack or rubbed it off AND the gate won't stay on the wall!Not a big deal or deal breaker.I bought it specifically because it fit in our super large 54" doorway.It also doesn't leave any marks on the walls.I highly recommend this gate for the price, size, and functionality.I just received this gate today and had it up withing 10 minutes.It looks good and seems very sturdy!My house has thick/wide baseboards and many gates don't work, but this one has separate  adjustable top and bottom.It doesn't swing open or shut and it takes a few seconds to remove, but the price is good and it is great for the intended purpose.It works great so far.We brought it to confine our puppy when we need to leave her alone in the house, and wanting something easy to setup and store away we went for the Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate, thinking it would be the ideal solution.Firstly, this gate did not fit our standard sized doorways.We'd been hoping that as the gate was advertised as being a travel gate, it would fit both small and wide openings.There was no way I could manage to put this up myself (my husband did it for me).It wasn't very easy to put back into the travel bag either.It took both my husband and I to get it back in there!It is very easy to use.I like the seat belt adjuster strap - helps me get the shoulder belt in the correct position.She also likes the cup holder (I like that there are two - so she can share one with her sister, and that they are flexible - so they hold juice boxes, etc).I look at it like an extra pair of hands when my hubby is not home.-the spinny seat is a bit wide (we have to put baby blankets around my 4 month old) since he is still a bit of a bobble head and is a skinny dudeI would buy this again in a heartbeat!That's how much it's been a sanity saver for me (I was not about to spend 100.00 and I'm glad I didn't some of the other styles are HUGE and way to over stimulating in my opinion).son enjoys his jumper but I think in a month or two he will love it.Right now he is a bit small so he can't quite hold himself up.The seat seems to be deep and is not adjustable.I use it for 10-15 min while I am doing chores upstairs in our bedrooms.The little musical piece is great and I actually take it off and put it on his walker too.It also takes a beating because my child thinks it is funny to keep ramming it into the door frame over and over.These bottles leak around the edge with a Nuby nipple.The sleeves also mold.I figured I could use the manual pump if need be, but as a last-ditch effort bought the larger flanges.Our son was born in April of 2010 and LOVEs these binkies (what we call them)...he won't take any other brand, trust me I tried.These are the perfect fit when other calming methods have failed.They are simple and effective.We bought three of the Sassy Suction toys for our 3-month old.The toys also can come apart from the suction cup, which can be used with those colorful hooks to be hooked up on a jungle gym or activity jumper to dangle.These don't seem like she'll tire from them easily, so I envision bringing them to restaurants to play with, or anywhere else they can be suctioned to.It's cute and fun looking but it doesn't work.First of all, there's no way to turn off the one piece that makes noise.We don't even try to use it with her anymore.I bought this to attach to my 7 mo.old son's bumbo-chair (he has the attached feeding top) and he loves it.The level of music is pleasant enough, and it is a cute little song.The toy seemed great at first but I shortly realized it's downfall.First the positives:-Bright and colorful.-Fun noise/music that my baby girl loves.-Lots of different parts to keep her easily amused.-Suction works fine-DurableNegative:The toy EASILY comes out of the suction base.I bought this so my (5 month old) daughter would have a toy to play with in her highchair that does not require me to pick it up off the floor every 2 minutes.If the toy was permanently attached to the base it would be the perfect highchair toy.I also may add a piece of velcro to secure the lid to see if that helps.But, overall, we love it.It folds up easy to travel as well.For the price, it's good.If I could give this -5 stars.She had it in her mouth for maybe 1-2 minutes, and then I noticed bright red stuff pouring from her mouth.It was so red, I thought it was blood.I then realized it was dye from the red fabric on the tail!I tried to wipe her mouth out, but literally for 30+ minutes, she kept drooling red dye- from only 1-2 minutes of chewing on the toy!I called the toy company after I calmed down, and then assured me that it is a non-toxic dye- fine, but I feel like it should not come out of a fabric that a baby will be chewing/sucking on.My almost 4 month old daughter just started grabbing 2 weeks ago and has and easy time holding on and it definitely catches her attention.They are easy for him to hold on to.This has been a wonderful simple first toy for our son.It's also a great size to throw in a small diaper bag.I was a little nervous he would poke himself with it, especially put the "beak" in his eye, but it didn't happen.Just judge your baby's control vs strength.Bought this as a gift for a friend and her daughter LOVED it.Then I started taking the ring off of the suction cup and attaching it to a link so it could entertain him on trips or at the store.It's only a little bit of variety, but it's variety.I don't think the light up ball is a big factor for my son.He seems more interested in the tactile and movement aspects.He is now 7 months old, and I hold this toy responsible for quelling crying on several road trips, and providing me with peace, in 5-15 minute increments on multiple occasions, in several different environments.I would absolutely purchase again.UPDATE: Now we have a 10 month old, and the Illumination Station is not in play as much as it used to be, but it still entertains when it is.I'm pretty surprised that our son hasn't learned how to pull the suction cup off of surfaces yet!My son loves this toy.I am not certain what is so awesome to him but he goes for this one 3/4 of the time!This toy is bright colors and has a fun light up aspect and my son seems to like it.However, the suction part of the toy is not very strong.I use just one of these on my stroller with an 18 month old in the other seat.It works ok and is secure but there are a few issues.-with a large carrier car seat (we have a safety 1st air) the seat bumps the head of the front passenger, this can be solved by putting the carrier in the further position but that seems to be viewed as an open invitation to strangers to look at/touch/cough on/etc.I really wanted to love this and if it had worked, I would have!I ordered two of these and BOTH didn't work correctly - I would leave it on the charging base for 24 hours and then the minute I picked it up, it didn't work and then acted like it wasn't charged.I wished it worked, as this would have been perfect for changing baby.I'm too embarrassed to ask the people I gifted them to, if theirs still work.Out of all of these that I purchased, only one still works.My two year old son likes the toy and enjoys pushing the button on the bottom and see it change color.He brings it to different objects in a dark room and he likes how this toy lights them in different color.Then one of the colors stopped working.I again paid return shipping and had it exchanged.The new light arrived and seemed to work fine.It would only work on one color that night and the following night would not come on at all.I was not able to exchage or return it since it held on until just after the 30 day mark.We received this nightlight as a gift and we were really surprised with how convenient it was.I love how portable it was too.We could let our son play with the light in his crib.Sadly, after about 9 months of daily use, it just stopped working.The light on the base shows that the battery is charged but it just won't turn on anymore.It has a 15-minute auto-off (blue only), alwasy blue, always green, always red, and always changing (where you get the colors mentioned plus yellow, orange, purple, and a bunch of interesting shades in between.An led glows red whjile the lightis charging and turns blue when it's done.It stays cool to the touch.My almost 13 month old son loves it.I also tried the kind that you plug into the wall from the same manufacture.I had to return it on the same day that it got delivered.I am surprised how this company could stay in business.This is a great and safe night light toy for your little one.She was very intrigued by the lights and the changing lights.My kids love this light.I'm not sure how good of a nightlight it will be, but it's already been a great toy.Since the lights are LED it's cool to the touch and as noted in the description it can be set into different color modes.My kids pretty much want it on "rainbow" where it switches colors.The charging base is great, but this is where the nightlight part breaks down for me: I've got two little boys and there is no way they aren't going to take that light off that stand and run off with it.They have put it through the "can a toddler break it" test and it has come through with shining colors.Um, no pun intended there.All in all a great little toy, or nightlight depending on what you want to use it for.The time it remains on has increased steadily but I am not sure whether it is because of repeated chargings or whether it has to do with the color of light selected.When using the red mode and after five days of charging during the day, the light finally remained on for ten hours.When operated in the steady, blue light mode this light does an outstanding job illuminating a small bathroom.Because blue light (and green) will cause one to wake-up, if using this for a nightlight or to illuminate a hallway or bathroom, I would recommend using the red setting.Even then, the light does an excellent job lighting a small bathroom and the adjoining hallway.Making the red light a the default option would be a big plus.The Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate is suprisingly sturdy.This little Mobi is great!My two year old loves it and I can safely let him hold it without worrying about him getting burnt because it is too hot.It works as a great night light, especially in the bathroom.I love that it goes on when there is a power outage and give you another flashlight.Her original was solid pink, no fancy dimming features, no color changing... but also in my opinion vastly superior to the new design.The biggest difference, other then the color changing & dimming feature is that with the original there were NO exposed parts... no metal anything exposed on the actual glomate and nothing on the charging base... with a product designed for small children I can't for the life of me figure out why they would change the design of the glomate and charger so that components/metal are exposed.I've included photos showing the differences so you can see for yourself.We purchased one for our younger son (2) and he loved it.So we got another for our 5 yr old son.I love this little nightlight.My daughter has no fear of the dark yet, so we're using it for night-time bathroom trips.The little glow from the charger is enough to find it in the room, and lifting it off the charger makes a nice, pretty bright glow.This one works great.She loves it and we do too.Good quality.Added 3 years later.My daughter still uses this night light and loves it.You can also change colors.I LOVE LOVE LOVE this nightlight!So, let me start by saying that I am really picky about night lights and have gone through 4 or 5 of them in the last year.Typically when you think of night lights, you picture a small light that plugs directly into the wall, has a tiny light bulb with a cheap plastic on/off switch on the base, right?My son's bedroom does not have any plugs that are high off the ground, so any night light I've found has been easily within his reach.So this is where the Mobi TykeLight has been a God-send.Or you can set it to maintain a constant glow and then mom or dad can turn it off later.This night light is well made and works extremely well.This little glow dude is pretty fun and is certainly enjoyed by our little boys.I have already noticed the light has started to flicker a bit especially when the color changes or when you are moving around with it.As far as using it as a night light I personally think it is too bright except for the red color.My daughter is in the process of learning night time potty training.This light is the perfect thing for her because it helps her find the bathroom and only stays on as long as she needs it.really great.This is a really cool nightlight.We are a family that has every shape, size, color nightlight...hallway lights on, bathroom lights on...whatever necessary to keep away bedbugs, bathroom Willies, and any other nighttime creatures.I have four children and two of the four are night walkers, meaning they wake frequently (they are not always awake) and will need to go to the bathroom, say hello, give us a useless fact or tidbit, or they are just walking in their sleep.My two year old can come right out his room and sees the GloMate and is instantly put at ease.My 8 year old who sleep walks can roam around and does not hurt herself or scare herself by not being able to see.My other two hardly ever wake up, but if they did, they would see the GloMate too.Everyone loves the color changing feature.My two year old actually loves the GloMate so much, we had to put it on a higher table so he would stop taking it.Not sure what nighttime creatures or bathroom Willies will be at the beach this year.(I've seen lots of other reviews saying theirs didn't hold up; I'll change my review if ours breaks too easily, but for now I'm not taking that into account.)The color-changing mode is fun to watch, even for adults.The package clearly states it's for 2 years and up.Our son is fascinated by his Tykelight and loves to hold it, but of course we only let him have it when he's closely supervised.It's really not enough light to change a middle-of-the-night diaper, either.There has been research that may show a link between nearsightedness and night lights.See the NY times article "Night Lights Linked To Vision Problem" from May of 1999.Link: [...]That being said: the light itself is kinda fun and simple.I also have reservations about allowing access to the base that charges the light.Kids and wires are just two things I try to separate as much as possible - for many reasons.Otherwise, it is a simple soft light that changes colors.I didn't want to turn on bright overhead lights and this was a nice, soft alternative.My Children (ages 4.5 and 2.5) love the Mobi Tykelight.It glows a beautiful array of colors and they can entertain themselves with it for quite a while.My kids like to make forts and then take the light inside and watch it turn colors.A great item to add to your child's room!I am happy with this light.It can change colors too.The material seems very safe and kid friendly.It is lightweight, can be carried in plane.My 18 month old is very happy with it, she keeps playing with it.Pretty cool concept really... A light that my son can carry around with him wherever he goes, which was nice...This nightlight is very cool.Recommended!It gives a nice, soft glow.The colors are very nice.This means it cannot be used as an emergency light when the power goes off.It does glow a nice blue when you press the button on the bottom once and will go out after 15 minutes.(And not really a separate point: on rainbow mode, you see colors like yellow, orange, and purple, but you can't select those as static colors.As it is, there's a metal ring flush with the bottom of the TykeLight, and i get just a bit nervous when i see my son chewing on it.And a few positive observations: i love that it turns on if the power goes out.Today, it stopped charging entirely, no matter how much i jiggled or twisted it.It's very sad to watch my son pick up the TykeLight and put it back in the base, again and again, waiting for it to light up like it used to.Very sad.So... definitely not sturdy enough to be a toy.My 22 month old son loves this nightlight.He loves to filter through the colors and he knows that when we get the nightlight turned on that bedtime is near.It is a bit tricky to push the button so it doesn't turn off after a couple of hours.I like all the different colors along with the morphing view that changes from color to color.It is a perfect nightlight for a toddler!We charged this up, used it... and it lit up for us exactly once.No amount of fiddling with it & recharging it has brought it back to life again.Great design, nice idea...if it worked.We loved this light.Unfortunately, the "guts" of the light keep falling out the bottom- they are not secured into the light.I considered sending it back, but our toddler was so attached to her "glow man" I decided to just see how long it would last.I contacted the company and they sent a new one out right away.The customer service was very friendly and very prompt.The new one works perfectly and my daughter (almost 2) really likes pushing the button to cycle through the colors of light.Its soft glow illuminates my son's room at night.The light is softer and less harsh than a regular nightlight.It is cool to the touch so it won't burn hands when touched.I know my son loves it, and often asks to have it in bed with him.He also likes to choose the colors.Then I bumped it, and broke the connection to the base.When I put it back down, the charging light wouldn't turn red again to indicate that it was charging again.I had to remove the light from the base, unplug the charging station, and then plug and replace to get the indicator light to glow red again.It will go blue, green, and the aqua color inbetween green and blue, but not to red.On the "blend" mode, where it cycles between the colors, it will just skip the red (and the purple and pink and orange that should be blended colors) altogether.They wash well and look great.Yes, we have had some staining around the legs, mostly on the white edging.These are wonderful and much better than any others that we have tried!My son is now 4mo and we have been using cloth since birth.Now that my son is in a small (vs xsmall) I find that this cover leaves ample room for inserts while the duo wrap is a bit snug.Also, the tabs always stay velcroed to the right place while being washed (a rarity).Highly recommend!They are great at keeping in messes and they come in tons of great colors.I went ahead and got a Thirsties Duo in size 2 but that's still too big on her.Thirsties Basics- cute colors, take care with chubby legged babies, may have to go up a size before the sizing chart says you have to, wipe out easily.Bummis SSW: No leg gussets so fit a lot better on my baby's legs without digging in or making them red.If that lining gets something on it, you can't wipe it out as easily as with the Thirsties.Bummis SSW basics- not as many cute colors (if that's important to you), less easy to wipe out, size (with no leg gussets) is absolutely perfect for my chubby legged baby.Both are great covers.If you have friends who cloth diaper you may want to borrow a wrap or two to see what will fit best.Use this over regular prefold diapers (by Gerber) and they work great.However, they now fit great.They still look new and the velcro is in great condition.I bought this diaper cover before my son was born.My son's skin seemed to react where the PUL came in contact on the inside of the cover with his stomach and thighs.His daddy and an older sister have sensitive skin, so your mileage may vary.The cover is well made and very sturdy, and I will be sending it to a friend who loves Thirsties - it's just not the cover for me.The diaper is great.I use it with Chinese prefolds purchased on amazon.If there is a leak, the trim soaks it up so you have wash the otherwise clean diaper.It's a little annoying that they never look clean.The velcro also is fraying around the edges, so they already look old, but the Velcro does function fine.We do wash ours with the cloth diapers, so add that caveat to my minor complaints ...But the overall impression is that if you're going to do cloth, definitely get a few of these.I love the extra elastic around the legs to hold everything in so no spillage!Our purchase came out of necessity as we were going on our first road trip with our 9mo baby.3 days before the trip he said to me, "maybe we need one of those umbrella strollers."Since we were going to a sunny beach area I knew we needed a stroller with a great sunshade.It came down to the g-luxe and the maclaren triumph.My husband went to our local baby store (where we got our Vista) and picked up a g-luxe, but it was a 2009 model without the deeper seat and larger sunshade.The stroller is nice and light, easy to fold/unfold and quite sturdy.The sunshade was great as it was very sunny, and it even helped with keeping the full force of the wind off my baby.The height is also good for me (I'm 5'6") and my husband (6'4"), though he says it's basically at the limit of what is comfortable for him (any shorter and he'd be in trouble).The stroller rolls nicely over varied surfaces - great on paved sidewalks and non-plush carpets, less so on grass or highly textured carpets.Storage is fine, though not that spacious.Great stroller and well worth the money.It really is super light-weight, folds well, the color conceals any dirt, easily wiped clean, the basket is super convenient, the cup holder is of course a plus, and the padded seat worked well enough to keep a 12 month old happy all day in a park!GREAT prodcut- would suggest this to anyone looking for a smaller stroller.this is the only option for the baby bjorn travel crib so i was so relieved when it was of great quality.its thin and soft on the skin = perfectI should also mention that we use the baby bjorn travel crib as her main crib.I have this now, and it works just fine.we bought this toy to go with the Babysitter which we love but not sure if our baby (4months right now) likes it.For one, she always hits it by accident with her arm so then I am compelled to remove it.It doesn't make any noise or anything so it has to rely on the pretty colors to draw her attention.Second, when the baby sits in the bouncer, you have a perfect toy for the little one to play with.I can see my baby is making progress with it.Then, she started to open her palms and tried to use her fingers to rotate the pieces.So I can go to the kitchen to grab some stuff or wash a few dishes while she plays it.It's absolutely adorable watching her play this toy.I love it.It's attractive, well-crafted, and colorful.The pieces spin like they're designed to--when Baby manipulates them.All of these things really encourage and help develop fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination.We loved the baby bjorn seat and added this at about 4m.Baby loved it for 10 min but after that was irritated with the toy in his face.We may have kept it if we bought it sooner but at his age he really was more interested in looking at real people!Also, make sure it attaches well.Worth trying out since Amazon offers no hassle returns!There are a few plastic pieces, like the petals of the "flowers" and the red bead line around the "smiley face".But very nice overall.It was very hard for us to "get out" of a miracle blanket because the baby had eczema and would scratch his face till blood.I ended up ordering two more!!All I can say that the have a deluxe version that has a better quality fabric, so i would opt out for that one instead of this.I have tried just about every gimick there is and the Woombie was my last grab of desperation -- guess what, it didn't work.However, they do not have the caps, which is somewhat inconvenient, but worth it in the end for me.I bought these pacifiers for my son who goes to daycare.Unlike most pacifiers, these pacifiers come with individual caps so you can sterilize them and keep them sterilized until used.I bought this for my son's nursery.With the monkey face on top, it fitted well with the 'jungle-theme' of his room.I love the size, it is perfect for his laundry.works perfect for our little infant boy and his dirty clothes and rags--footprint isn't too large but adds nice color to the room.We've been using this hamper in my toddler son's room for the last year and I love it.It's lightweight but very sturdy.It's nothing special but it does a great job.It fits the theme of the nursery, jungle/monkey theme.It's adorable.I bought this and she is loving it.Secures easily and safely.Simple to position.The first one was flexible plastic and the reflection was all distorted.I received this as a gift at my baby shower.This one fit the bill.The whole thing is super sturdy.My daughter uses the rails to cruise around the playpen and pushes walls all the time and it doesn't move at all.The only con is the bedsheet.It is nice and soft but it is are ill-fitting and expensive to get spares.It doesn't fit quite right and pulls in the mat around the edges so the don't quite touch the walls.We've owed our Joovy for over 3 months now and it has been a sturdy and portable playyard.It packs easily in the carrying case and is fairly easy to set up and use.Do not understand why the yellow and red colors were cheaper than the black so if color is not an issue, go for the other colors.Recommended highly.This is one of the must have items for all mothers.... this has saved me so much time!!!I mix the formula so easily!!!!I absolutely love this pitcher.It mixes formula without creating all the air bubbles.Then when she is hungry i just take it out of the fridge and pour whatever amount that i need at that time.I love it!It is worth every penny!I bought this pitcher because a few friends said it might help.It made a world of difference.Now I make her bottles for the whole day in one batch.This was a life saver!An absolute must to mix formula thoroughly and with less foaming and bubbles for baby!This pitcher is so useful, I even bought one for my parents' house for when we visit.It is easy to clean and simple to use.AWESOME!This is the most awesome contraption!Good stroller, but not a great double stroller.It is a great stroller for one child, but when you put the larger child in the rumble seat it is difficult to control.We have two strollers that we used with our first son -- the BOB revolution and a Maclaren Triumph.The City Select was the first to get dismissed from contention.I thought the City Select was a good double but not a great single stroller.My son didn't like the seat of the Bugaboo and refused to sit in it, which could be just him but he didn't like the way the fabric cover attached to the seat.Both my son and I liked having him higher off the ground.The flexibility for the seating on the uppababy was far superior with both the rumbleseat and the piggyback board.And I have to mention again the ease of folding the uppababy.There are wonderful aspects of the stroller that I didn't really appreciate until I was using it for a while.The basket under the stroller is massive.It's just fun to take this on a trip around the neighborhood to run errands.Two of the improvements to the 2010 model are really fantastic - the new wheels and the 0 degree recline.My son loves being able to sit fully upright.In the 2010 version the brake is a small pedal above the right wheel.So I can step on the brake, the stroller will keep rolling even though the brake is engaged, then I'll step on it again and thus disengage it, etc.We wanted a safe, soft ride for the baby and one that could grow with our family.The stroller itself is a single stroller but a second "rumble seat" is available as well as a board that hooks on the back so that the older kid can ride while the infant rides in the main seat.What I like about the stroller:1) the ride- very smooth ride, padded seat for baby.The toddler seat is deep and wide.We also brought the bassinet into the house and used it, well, as a bassinet!while we were in the living room etc.The bassinet also comes with a cover so when the weather got colder, I could still take my son for walks with a blanket and the cover and I knew he was warm.the toddler seat can also face front or back.There is a pop out sunshade that gives an additional amount of protection.It's truly amazing how big the sunshade is and the design is genius.and very easy to access.It's not a one-hand fold but it's easy.Still, it's very very easy8) The toddler seat- has lots of different recline positions, awesome sun protection, and adjustable leg rest.Our little guy was so warm inside his little cave!What could be better-1) cup holders- the uppa baby ones are pretty bad.I had read similar reviews on these but I bought them anyway.I don't like them because they are on the outside of the stroller which makes it wider.They are also not very deep and don't accommodate cups with handles (like those insulated travel mugs).I've even tried juggling a snack too, and it would be nice to have a place for that as well.Everything else they've designed has been so smart that I'm sure they can come up with a cool feature for this.The true test- DISNEY WORLD.Disney really needs to come up with a better system.Back to the stroller, I bought the maya, which is a yellow color.I specifically chose it so that i could easily pick it out in a crowd.And I'd argue that there aren't many places more crowded with strollers than Disney world during Thanksgiving week.All the moving parts of the seat allowed us to create a little cave for him which was great for when he fell asleep, we could keep some noise and lights out (and cool night temperatures).This was nice too.Optional items we have that go with the stroller:Car seat adaptor- we have chicco.this is super easy pop in and out.It's AWESOME.For the full price you not only get the frame and a stroller seat, but the bassinet with its own mosquito and wind cover, along with those for the stroller seat.It is a great buy and one of the top ranked strollers for its versatility, quality and durability.I love it!It folds up like a dream and the car adapter is a life saver in the winter when you don't want to take out your kid in the cold into the stroller seat or bassinet.Definitely highly recommended, especially when I see the pitfalls of the other strollers from other mom's.I'm so happy my husband and I decided to purchase this.It's easy to operate and clips right onto their diaper so you can take it anywhere.For the most part it stays put, although once it came loose and wasn't touching my sons skin, the alarm went off and scared me to death!First it vibrates to try to wake the baby up if they aren't breathing, then it vibrates and the alarm goes off.Love love love this snack container!I have formula in the top part and then fill the rest with snacks and when we're out and about all day, having all the snacks in one place is fantastic, not to mention it's a space saver in the diaper bag!We haven't used them in the bath yet so I can't say if they'll work there.I may return them... the picture is definitely enhanced.The pieces aren't that bright and cheery.My son enjoys all the lights and sounds, there very easy to set off.We have hardwood floors and I just dont feel comfortable with baby laying on mat without extra padding underneath it.Great mattress.It fits perfect in the crib and my son (3 mo.)But a many accidents later I realized, it was the only choice.-It's a great, mattress for a baby/newborn, on the softer, but still supportive side.-I say upgrade once they can stand/walk, because it's light duty, not made for jumping and not all that resilient with the increased weight of a toddler over an infant.-This mattress has maintained it's status though with awards and 'Best Buy's through the last few years though, so I'm sticking with it.fits perfectly in the crib, seems like the perfect mix of firm/soft.Baby is 5 months old, so we'll see how it holds up (but I think it has a great warranty too)I bought this in September 2009 to use in my daughter's crib a DaVinci Kalani Convertible Crib.Great buy, well worth the little bit extra I paid over standard mattress from Sealy.These Nuby ones are excellent.Furthermore, it will be IN THE CLOSEST.No one but the people who dress your child are going to see it, and do you really think grandma or the babysitter is going to care or even notice the color of the hangers??I can be very OCD sometimes, but not about something as trivial as hanger color.Boys can wear pink, girls can wear blue lol.These are excellent.We don't see any bubbles in the milk and the nipple is slow enough that our LO doesn't choke on it like other brand.We decided to get the standard model after finding out its wide-neck are made in china.Then we were told about these bottles.They are easily cleaned by tossing them in the dishwasher.The replacement parts are reasonable, if needed.Parents swear by these bottles and for good reason!This set has everything you need to get started, at a really amazing price point.I haven't tried any other bottles, but these work great!At 4 months, my baby is even holding up the bottle w/her 2 hands.Positive experience for us using Dr. Browns.Amazon has great prices, and we get all the accessories here.Don't need many small bottles.We bought extra nipples and bottles.Nipples come in various sizes at different month stages (3 month, 6 months).HIghly recommend them!I bought these because I was convinced that they'd just be the best for my baby with the special flow system and the freshness seals... but none of that matters one lick because my baby won't touch them!The poster who warned that the bottle brushes are not included is correct.No brushes.That's a shame, because I could actually use some bottle brushes.Maybe I can give these to someone from my breastfeeding mothers' group.We love these bottles.Good quality bottles!Yes, there are a lot of parts to wash!Other than that, these have been great.My baby was also colicky for 5 months of her life and I dont know if these did any good to help her but I have no complaints.It allows air back into the bottle without going through the milk, so your baby gets a constant supply of bubble-free food.Let me keep this simple.I imagine that something like this could be very valuable if you lived in a tropical climate and mosquito-born illness was a concern, but I live in New England and have screens on my windows, so I don't really need it at all.Let me reiterate that the quality and function seem to be perfectly adequate.I bought a crib tent to keep my cats out of the crib before the baby came but that product doesn't fit a convertible crib so this was a great alternative!Love the modern design for my modern home.The base sticks far out which may not work for small kitchens but if that helps make it stable fine by me.It has 3 levels of recline which is nice though not sure if I will be using it.FYI the directions are only photos no words.It's a bit pricier than others on the market but I haven't had to replace them.Update:  Been using this for two years and my son still cannot open any doors with it on.Bought a few more too while the originals are still working just fine.I received this mobile as a baby shower gift and just love it!The assortment of animals and the raccoon climbing the side of the mobile make it very unique.It's true that the music only lasts a couple of minutes, but I don't have an issue with winding it up a couple of times.cracked bleeding nipples, raw skin).Couldn't be more pleased with this mattress.It fits perfectly in our crib (DaVinci Kalani Convertible Crib in Espresso).I am using it for my 1 year old.It is a bit less firm than some but not enough in my opinion to be worrying parents with a newborn.The tray is just as easy for my 14-mo-old son to flip over as any other plate.He can also easily separate the dish from the tray.My son has Cerebral Palsy and a Visual Impairment.This is the first bowl/plate I have found that actually stays in place when he bangs on it or searches for his food pieces with his hand.I have tried numerous bowls and plates, most of which, when he'd go to pick up the food or find the food, the bowl with all the food would end up on the floor.I just bought this bedding set.The ad picture was very cute but included more than 13 pieces.They would be appropriate for use with an older infant who couldmove around on his/her own when the risk of SIDS is lower-1 crib sheet-fitted-1 crib skirt-2 Window Valances-1 Diaper Stacker-1 toy bag- think toy hammock-2 decorative pillows-3 decorative wall hangingsCan't beat the prices for 13 pieces!When it arrived the colors were more vibrant then online and matched our nursery walls perfectly.The set is beautiful!Lots of the reviews raved about how this set is easy and safe for the baby to chew on (I learned through babysitting that giving an infant something to chew on is a good distraction during diaper changes- especially combs, if they're teething), and that the mirror on the bottom of the holder can be very entertaining as well.I haven't delivered yet (hopefully this week, I'm due tomorrow) so I can't remark on how well the set works on the baby but on my skin (I brushed the skin on my face which I think is as close to baby skin as I could get) the pieces do not hurt or scratch or catch.But that's not a huge problem.As far as ordering and delivering, I ordered through Amazon and it arrived within a week, in a brand new box and in perfect condition so I was very satisfied with that.I also ordered this well over a month ago and although I haven't been using it daily yet, its a sturdy set so I don't anticipate the baby being able to rip it apart after a few uses.)Its very cute and practical, can be used in a girl's or boy's nursery and for quite some time after infancy.And she's mostly interested in the brushes.So 2 years running and we're still happy with this purchase!Doesn't take up a lot of space, the brush is soft, and easy to hold!I'm really happy with the quality and like the way it looks in our bathroom, its really cute!My daughter loves it tooI got this items today and it was exactly as described.I could not find a fun brush and comb set for my son of 3 months.He could not take his eyes off of it today!Truly a cute usable item for his nursery.I only wish the squares were a little bigger so they covered more footage.I chose to purchase this owl for my nursery because I thought it was very unique for a stuffed animal.Like many of the other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised by its size.Check out the photo I added to get an idea of the size and colors.I absolutely LOVE this owl!I ordered the first one as a gift for a baby shower and was surprised at how large it is, but that just made it that much better than I expected.I requested one for my own baby's registry and have given a couple more as gifts since seeing it.It's cute, soft, colorful, and very huggable.I highly recommend this owl for any child!This owl is superbly made, is much larger than expected...it is as tall as the boy himself, and is offered at such a crazy eddy low price that I think there should be one owl in every home.It was so much easier than bringing the stroller or carrying her.We also find it very comfortable.It is easy if it is off but you almost always need adjustments once the baby is in the carrier (especially if you and your spouse are different sizes).I bought a beautiful Becco hoping that it would replace my bulkier Ergo for the summer months.In addition, the infant insert seemed intriguing to me.Unfortunately, I didn't find the Becco to be as comfortable as my Ergo---which was sad because it really is beautiful.For now, I'm sticking with my tried and true Ergo...still using daily.I've pretty much used it everyday since!I love it and so does my 7.5-month-old.It's a particularly great feature for back-carrying so that you don't have to lean over with a wiggly little person on you back.More important that that, though, is that it is so comfortable for both me and my daughter (and my husband, who loves it too.With baby on your back or front, you can go tons of places you'd never be able to with a stroller.However, once you get used to it, the internal harness gives you more options.We also really love being able to transfer our daughter from one parent to the other without taking her out of the carrier, which is only possible because of the internal harness.This truly improved my quality of life tremendously.After all the research I decided upon the Beco carrier because I liked the internal pocket and how the infant insert was included.One thing that has helped a lot is that if it cool I wrap a blanket around the straps to cover him.The fabric (Carnival) is absolutely gorgeous, and the item is very well made.I adjusted it multiple times, and just couldn't get a comfortable fit.I have to keep readjusting it and use some blanket stays.I use this in combination with a RayShade on our Maclaren triumph.Very lightweight.My biggest complaint is it seems VERY uncomfortable so she only lasts about 5 minutes in it.Perhaps the seat should be a bit more sunken in.It is not bouncy - which was not very important to me however should be noted since it is called the "bounce about" - and the seat does not spin easily.He is completely concentrated when he is in his saucer - learning how to use his hands, lean and spin the seat around.We got this because I need to keep him up for 20 minutes after he eats to avoid acid reflux.This is one fun activity he can do while he is upright.Overall this toy has no sounds, not very inviting to a baby, and the bounce pad doesn't provide any bounce.what i love about this cup-the decently fitting threads of the twist-on cap.what i don't like-the strange volcano-like eruption of whatever's inside the cup.We got this, and since then it's been all good, he can't open it, he doesn't even try anymore.It's simple for an adult to open it, but not for him.It's really sturdy and there is no way you can lift the lid even if you apply pressure.Very easy to install and easy to manage once installed.Highly recommend.However, at first my husband thought that it would not work, but he just had to work at it a little longer.)As it is, it is super easy for us to use.My husband did not even have to tell me how to unlock it, I easily figured it out myself.This looks great and was easy to install but we can't get it to stabilize and, because of the way it connects, the toilet seat now slips from side to side - sometime unexpectedly....I have tried to sip liquid from the mouth piece myself, and it was difficult for me, an adult!Ideal for toddlers who drink fairly well out of regular cups and whose parents want to minimize spills.These stand up far better than Take and Toss, which I generally like, to chewing and biting.They do travel well.Considering they are a dollar a cup, I wouldn't expect much from them.I do want to say, they are cheap, easy to wash, and my son handles them very well.I don't regret my purchase and I'm happy I didn't have to shell out 40 bucks for 10 cups.The cover is soft and it's nice to have the separate waterproof pad, but the color is atrocious!I love this changeing pad cover.It is so soft and the color is just like in the picture.It fits in with my nursery very well.They even sell a three pack of the white part now.I bought those as well and fit just the same as the one that came with it.This changing pad set is very soft.I wanted to love these nursing pads, but don't.Out of the 3 different kinds of organic nursing pads I've tried these are by far the most absorbent.I love them!I love that these pads are contoured.Put on two layers or put a washcloth underneath.I was worried how the contoured shape would hold up after washes (as other people commented in the review), but they still look perfect after several washes and tumble dry.These burp cloths are very thick and soft, two layers of good terry cloth bound together by the print fabric trim.But unfortunately, the seams tore apart after one wash.In fact, Amazon.com sent me a replacement for the burp cloths, and that one tore, also.When it comes to sewing bindings onto terry cloth, this brand definitely has quality control problems.Other than the constant ripping, these are actually very nice - soft, thick, and the print fabrics are cute.My only other complaint would be that they are a little on the narrow side.One of the cloths ripped again in the first wash.It's downright comical.These aren't my favorite burp cloths, but they'll do in a pinch.Pros: thick, great fabric choicesCons: not extremely soft, not large enoughI doubt we'll be using it as much as a a regular pacifer, but for newborns it's awesomeJust the right noise level to be entertaining, yet not irritating.Overall, a great baby rattle!Otherwise, it's great!not sure how they expect you to use it without the tape.Otherwise easy to install and I love that it is in black as matches the furniture!And you can cut to size.The color (black) blended with the table beautifully and once applied, it looks almost seamless.)...a pretty good chunk of change, but I think it's completely worth it.Best part, I am now comfortable letting my 10 month old cruise around the coffee table, she does chew on the bumpers sometimes, but they are stuck on tight and aren't budging.I will say, some of the buckles were a bit challenging to tighten, but once it's on, you're good.Unless you plan to take the seat on and off frequently it's not an issue.I am very pleased with my purchase.I think this seat will be very easy to clean and it blends in so well with our brown furniture.I absolutely love these plates, they are the perfect size for my toddler, and the 4 divided section are awesome.The only minor complaint I have is that they do not nest when stacked in the cupboard.I don't know what people generally didn't like it but I believe that the brush does its job.It's true that I don't use the soap system that comes within but otherwise it's good , sturdy, doesn't become gross.I just wrote a complaint letter to Sassy.The nipples were a pain to wash as the nipple brush kept on collapsing into the closed position as I was washing the nipples.The next day I went and bought another brush and I am much happier with this brush than the Sassy brush.Don't waste your time and money on this brush.I got this brush as part of my baby shower gifts.As a bottle brush alone...this one is a winner!The silicone brush is really great and cleans very well.The nipple brush is also great.I use these brushes multiple times a day.The awful part is the soap dispenser.Unfortunately, it doesn't work.You don't even get a chance to dispense it, because it all leaks out!It is very soft and I have peace of mind knowing that it is organic.After using (and loving) the American Baby velour crib sheets, we purchased this sheet for our Chicco playard and love it!It fits perfectly without having to strain to get it around the bottom pad.It's easy to use and wash and feels so soft!fits the graco pack n play nicely.I bought this sheet to use on the portable cribs at my son's daycare.i loved the feel of this sheet, however it was way too big for the pack & play mattress i bought it for so I had to return it.I have the regular crib size sheet from this company which is awesome.I bought this sheet to go on our Chicco pack and play unit and it fits great.It's soft enough for his face to lie on, though.I also like the natural color alot.I bought this for my nearly two year old daughter.It's the perfect size for her, and she's figuring out what to do with it.While I don't mind, it's a bit of a pain.I bought these highchair and set for my son and I cannot give this chair high enough praise.I love that all I have to do is wipe off this seat with a rag and soap and my job is done.We got the baby Dream Baby gate for a baby shower, and I needed the extension in order to reach the width of my hallway.I think there are two different heights of the gates, so be aware of that while ordering the extension, but I had no issues with that at all.Love these!!!My son's nursery is absolutely precious with them... and they are very light canvas so I can hang them over his crib and won't be concerned if somehow they fell.Those have air flow and doesn't squash my son's nose.However with this one, if my son puts it in upside down, it will squish my son's nose.I read about the length of time the glow in the dark feature lasts, and all of the reviews are correct...it doesn't last that long.I love the avent pacifiers otherwise.I just wish the glow lasted a bit longer.They're really attractive as well & come in a variety of different colors.Love them.I have just opened a box with this comforter set (I got it though my baby registry) and it's a 100 times cuter then I anticipated.I'm keeping both.Good quality, fits the crib perfectly, lovely colors and pattern.Other than that hugely important aspect, the bag is what it is- a bag.Even this setting is uncomfortable.I very much regret choosing the cheap option.Wonderful invention.If you read the instructions it says to untwist it 1/4 of a turn.These I also like because of their wide base.Just wish the wide ones were made in the USA.I was debating to get the wide neck or the standard.The wide neck made so much more sense since the nipple is more of a modern design (like Avent and others) and Dr. Brown claims its more closer to actual breast nipples.The standard version has a MADE IN USA shield tagged in front of the box, this one doesn't.Upon closer inspection, we found out this unit was made in China.We went back to the store where we purchased from and as it turns out, all of the wide neck bottles are made in China.I guess Handi-Craft decided to bring their newer line manufacturing to China.We like Dr. Brown's bottle, our baby doesn't need to burp as much compared to Avent.Quality control in China its almost a guessing game.Just remember the recent lead paint in toys and melamine laced milk powders (domestic products within China)  I'm sure parents will pay a premium for products that's made in a place where quality controls matters.Avent is made in England,  Born-Free is made in Israel.Even with that assurance, we can't be 100% confidence with its quality.I have been breastfeeding and using Dr. Brown bottles as well since my son was born.I am using these bottles since last 7 months and they are fabulous.The number of pieces comprising the venting system where cumbersome to manage and keep clean.We found the Dr. Browns Natural Flow 4oz.Wideneck Bottles to be very messy.The bottles flow was too much and caused a lot of spilage for our newborn granddaughter.And then i figured since by baby's been taking born free which are wider, let me get the wide neck- AWEFUL!!!the bottles leak like there's no tomorrow.I was visiting my sister and packed 4 bottles to take with me.I would not recommend the wide neck at least.(Which I love by the way).I have sanity now!For all the complaints about the "parts" inside, I don't see the problem.Compared to Avent which has 4 parts, there's just one more.There used to be a Doc Brown from the Back to the Future movie trilogy which involved time travel in order to correct life's mishaps.Playtex Vent Aire didn't change anything either.For Doc Brown, it was Back to the Future.For Dr. Brown's bottles, it's back to the drawing board.The only real difference that I could see was the extra parts that required washing.My son is 4 months old and he has a lot of gas.I have tried several brands including Playtex ventaire and Born Free, but he still had a lot of gas until we tried Dr Brown.These feeding bottles have several parts to wash, just like Born Free bottles.I bought these outright so can't say if another brand is better or not.These bottles are great!Also, be sure to pull the nipple all the way up through the ring that seals the bottle.I did notice that if you warm the milk in the bottle in hot water, the change in temperature can make the milk go up the inner air vent tube.I just make sure that I don't screw the white ring on tight while warming so that the pressure can equalize.Love these bottle though!Maclaren brand is fabulous.We've had an umbrella stroller for years that I loved.When we added to our family again, I knew that I did NOT want another travel system.This stroller frame is amazing.It folds up tiny, almost the size of an umbrella stroller.Outings with baby are so easy and uncomplicated with this.It does great on setting A, and there is a black strap to secure it.However, I always make sure to use ramps, rather than tipping over a curb...and other common sense safety measures.I'll also clarify that its a snug fit, not wobbly at all.Just no snapping in, as if using a travel system.I baught Easy Traveller after looking at the graco, kolkraft, and baby trend versions and love my choice!It folds up half the size as the others, fits a ton of stuff in the basket, and is so lightweight!My Chicco fits on the "A" position.It is lightweight and compact.I placed the Chicco Key Fit in the A position and it fits perfectly!I would feel safe transporting my little guy in this stroller.I have not used it yet since the baby has not come yet.But, I don't regret my purchase at all!i bought this to use with my chicco keyfit 30.It is about as wide as the car seat and I have never paid attention to the height (5'4, husband 6'1).I keep it in the trunk and it is easy to pull out and open and close with the baby in the other hand.Great stroller.Easy to turn, but you do really need to use two hands to steer or the stroller will not go straight (tough when the baby cried to be held and you still got to get the stroller home).This may just be the best diaper bag I've ever owned.It has lots of pockets (LOTS!)and it is stylish.It has a zipper top and the carriage clips are great!We love our baggalini tote.Also, in my opinion, the straps are too small, making it a somewhat tight fit.I'd prefer to have the option of one over the shoulder strap as well.It's easy to keep it organized, and it looks so chic!It has a ton of pockets and space without being bulky.The straps and zippers are strong and well made also and it has a contrasting light color(tannish)interior.I use cloth diapers and this bag is perfect to be able to fit everything I need.In person the color is slightly darker than how it shows on my screen.Edited to add:  I still like the look, pockets, space etc.I have aSkip Hop Pronto Changer Diaper Bag, Blackthat I like to bring along instead of the diaper change pad that comes with the purse, so that I can hand it off to my husband to do a diaper change if necessary, and it's just easier to carry the Pronto changer to the bathroom instead of lugging the whole diaper bag, but once that is in the bag, there's very little room width wise for much else!It is a deep bag height-wise though, so things can fit in vertically, but if they are wider/fatter objects, it becomes a little tight space wise.Also, I'm a very petite mom, 5'2 at the most, and this bag looks enormous on me.This is by far my favorite of them all.- It has tons of pockets - for everything you will ever need to carry.They didnt forget a thing.- Very roomy without being huge.That means I need to carry pull ups and lots of extra clothes, as well as all the necessary baby stuff.- Love the insulated side pockets for sippys and my bottle of water.- Antimicrobial liner is perfect for the snack pocket.- Great shoulder straps & fits perfectly on all 3 of my strollers with the handy stroller clips.- I get lots of compliments asking about the brand & where I got it.I purchased this being a little hesitant because most of the other reviews but I have to say I am pleasantly surprised!I've had it for a while now and it's held up to the abuse my eight month old gives it.My son is to the stage where he won't hold still for two minutes, so I have to be very prepared when it comes to changing his diaper.This holds an entire refill (about 60+ wipes) easily and is a great design.There are MORE pros than cons for this wipes case.Pros:1. you can attach it to stroller or outside of diaper bag.2.you can really open it with one hand, allowing your other hand to be holding baby.4.easier to remove wipes than it is from those cheap travel cases (mentioned above in #2)4. holds WAY more wipes than those cheap travel cases doCons:1.But in the case's defense, i did have it chuck full of wipes.so it could have been the sheer weight of the wipes that made the case open up.Easy for a toddler to pull off the red button, but it does snap back on.Just make sure you put it back on the right way b/c one side of the button is raised higher than the other to aid your thumb when trying to push it open with one hand.It is exremely big and bulky, bigger than the actual wipes from the package.The red button pops off if you use to much pressure3.The wipes dry out very quicklyI use the travel wipes from Target - cost less than a dollar, more in the package, no need to transfer, more compact and they stay moist!It's difficult to use with one hand as the slider is hard to open and the wipes are very hard to pull out.Will keep to use as a spare around the house, but would not recommend this.Recieved these as a baby shower gift and really like them.They are quite large and bulky but would be great for an older baby.I love these towels, they're absolutely adorable!Still, love these!The Strollair fit perfectly on our stroller.It has quite a few velco straps so you can adjust it to fit any stroller, as well as an adjustable strap.The cup holders fit a nice size water bottle and the pocket in the middle is good sized for cell phones, keys, i-pod, etc.It was definitely a worthwhile purchase.I wanted cup holders for the adults on my double stroller and this one works really well, very happy w/ my purchase.Baby seems comfortable and even comforted by the dark cacoon it creates for her.Before my purchase (from a local store, not Amazon), I had my doubts about this expensive product, but as someone who was just starting to make baby food for an 8.5 month-old who was not too keen on the chunkier textures, and since I didn't want to feed him the stage 3 store jars with meat in them, I needed to know that I was doing it right (steamed enough, etc), and this practical item did the trick.Overall, it is nice to have one device that does the steaming and the processing (it can also reheat, but it is just as easy and safe in the microwave if you are careful).And I love the spoon that is angled just right to get every little bit of food out of there.I can have baby food in about 10 minutes, so if I run out, it just takes a few minutes to make something freshGreat puree - really smooth and creamy, or as chunky as you wishit's small - not a space hog in my cramped kitchenLooks cute - so I don't having it out all the timeIf you are leaning towards getting the device, or registering one for your baby shower - DO IT!If anything it takes MORE time to prepare baby food with the Beaba simply because it has such a small capacity.You can put about a cup to a cup and a half of chopped raw food in the steamer, which seems like a good amount of food.Always a great food to start babies on because it's mild and sweet and can be pureed really smooth and creamy.I can cook four LARGE sweet potatoes and puree them in my 7-cup food processor all at once.Just one hour  in the kitchen on Sunday and I had enough baby food to last all week, if not longer.Gladware makes small 4-ounce containers.I believe a pack of 8 is under 3 bucks.I would fill about a dozen of these at a time with 3 or 4 different foods and pop them in the freezer.Come mealtime, it was fast and easy to scoop out what I needed and warm it up in the microwave.After several months of freezing and heating the little blue lids of the Gladware containers would crack, but they're so affordable that I didn't mind tossing some in the recycling bin and buying another set.I LOVED this thing, I used it everyday and it was great for 3 months.For my second one, I try Beaba Babycook =p  And no regrets!!!not to mention, FRESHLY MADE!!!and the rest 15 minutes is just waiting the food to be cooked.The liquid that comes out from the food are used, when pureeing, so using Beaba Babycook enhances the food taste.I can't say enough how awesome this cooker/steamer/blender is!I make fresh purees for my baby every morning before going to work..It's so easy!Since we have started trying solids, I have found it to be a life saver.Simply put, you don't need anything else to prepare baby food when you have Baby Cook.I LOVE my Beaba Babycooker.It's very small so it takes up barely any counter space.My baby 6 months old and I have made countless meals with it already.Many think you can't cook enough food.I like giving my baby fresh food and you can pack enough veggies to yield the equivalent to probably 6 baby food jars at a time.Cooking & cleaning are so fast that it's incredibly efficient.The Sure Lid containers are BPA free and have an attached lid - a really great feature.Hope this info helps...Sure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * 4 Ounce/Half Cup/118mL - 2 Per PackThe only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because I think the sugar bowl would be more fun if it filled up with water and it came out more slowly through the bottom.It's a sweet little gift.I bought one for my niece when I gave her a tea set and a tea party themed gift.The one teether that our youngest son DOES use is the widely availableThe First Years Massaging Action Teether.I bought this initially for my 2 year old.He was constantly curious about his baby sister's pacifiers (and they constantly went in his mouth, even though he never used a pacifier as a baby).I thought having this might keep him away from his sister's.Fast forward until my daughter turns about 4 months....I was having the hardest time finding a teether for her.Her mouth was still so little and she either couldn't get them in her mouth, or, if she could, they were so big she couldn't bite down on them.She absolutely loves it.We attach it to a pacifier strap and keep it in her carseat.My son will find it and use it over any others.If he has no pain, he's not interested, but if he does, this goes right into his mouth.He chomps on it until he gets the right spot, and is so happy afterwards.Also, he has always hated pacifiers, but he knows that this is different.It works better than tylenol or ambesol.Older adults have commented that they wish they had one when their children were babies.Update from when first ordered:I have ordered 4 more for spares and gifts to give to others.This is NOT what you want to happen.Intermittenly he shoves his fingers back there, but doesn't get any relief.And it's all there is, so it's worth a try and worth keeping it around in case it helps.Btw I bought it for $15 on amazon.I am so glad I purchased the 4-sided changing pad, it keeps her from squirming right off the table.But it's great!I haven't even used this yet, and the highest it can get is 2 stars!Who knows what this will do to her skin, let alone her BRAIN CELLS!Not pleased....hopefully it doesn't leak or I will be quite displeased!As our daughter outgrew her infant tub, I found this product and bought it based on the other reviews, and they were all accurate: this product is wonderful for the in-between stage where the regular bath tub might be too big for a little one.It is just the right height and size for a baby bath without using too much water to fill up your tub.IF you have a narrower-than-normal tub, this might not fit.In terms of width, this fits perfectly in our tub with not much room left over.There is no way one can inflate it with the mouth!It's absolutely impossible to use it this way.Oh yeah, one more con- my son cries the first few 10-20 seconds the tub.We used this tub a few times, and every time we put him in it, he cried until we calmed him down with some toys and then he enjoyed the the rest of the bath time...I don't know why.That could be specific only to my baby.I just love this tub!I got it over a year ago and I take it everywhere!It fits perfectly in the suitcase, is light weight, easy to inflate and use, atractive for the baby, and very, very, very practical!Very nice buy, worth it!This one was seemingly a bit pricey, and I didn't know how effective it would be but has ended up being one of my favorite purchases.Worth it--especially if your kid ends up being super active!You won't regret it!This pillow is adorable.It looks great in my glider and really ties the room together though so I highly recommend it.I have been uncomfortable ever since I moved my son into his own room because I can't SEE what's making him cry.It's this great window into that part of his world.I would prefer to fine tune the volume more but other than that, no complaints.We have been perfectly happy with this video monitor.We have only had some interference issues when there was construction on the road next to our house... but otherwise, we haven't had any trouble.Just wish it didn't take up so much counter space...Awesome camera, great sound, great picture, very durable, very affordable, wonderful product!As the paranoid first-timer, I was scared my little man would stop breathing due to SIDS...rolling over...pulling the cover over his head...being too close to a pillow...etc..etc..etc.!It has been through all kinds of abuse.If you want to do continuous handheld monitoring of your baby without being plugged into the wall outlet, this is not an effective unit.Pressing the button on top of the unit to get the video back is tiresome.The "widescreen" larger monitor is nice and we keep it in our bedroom.Why not just make it available online...or include it in the box?In 2010, you don't advertise a feature and make it impossible to get.But over all great item.Hand held unit works like a champ and except when moving around has a clear enough picture.Great option of 2 cameras wish it came with two, and had an option of 4.Required a little work to line everything up and the gate can be somewhat unwieldy so a helper is a good idea.The screws do extend on either side to help make the gate easily adjustable to fit perfectly.Our 1 year old has found spinning the little nut that holds the screw from loosening to be a lot of fun.It is actually closer to a bisque.This annoys my wife but I can't see how being off white hinders the gate's ability to function properly so I'm not subtracting stars for that either - just note that it is not stark white.There are not a lot of these sized gates out there and this one is great.It fits the 6' opening perfectly and looks fantastic!It's a darker bronze color (not what is pictured).My baby is almost 8 months and does have somewhat sensitive skin, but I was completely surprised to see the rashes developing from these teethers.We received these teethers as a gift and were very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the teethers and how much the babies liked them.Their shape makes it really easy for little hands to hold onto them, and the different surface textures of the teethers definitely appeals to the babies.On top of that, these teethers smell so delicious that it almost makes you want to chew on them!This was the first toy he actually held onto and would carry when we would move him, or pick him up.I love that they are BPA and Phthalate Free, SAFE.The vanilla scent is great!After he has a really good chew he always has "hint of vanilla" breath.They are easy to wash, the perfect size for him to hold, and really encourage coordination.Each one has different textures, and I'm very happy they come in a two pack in case he drops one, I then have the back up ready.Other than that, I honestly have not found any cons... We love these.Then one day the baby just began rejecting her and still won't touch her.I was left scrambling to find another suitable teether 'cause just a couple days before the baby turned one she cut her first three teeth in two days!After reading the reviews here I figured these had to be worth a try in spite of how pricey I think they are for such a small item.I am so happy I did though because this two pack is perfect.We got an orange lamb and a red elephant, each having a slightly different shape and thus textures.Either way these are a great teether in my opinion/experience as the rubber is soft, the scent isn't nasty, the texture and colors seem to be pleasing and while small the handles are just right for a baby's hand to hold.My 10-month old son loves these teethers - especially the poodle because of the texture.The smell is awesome even after a few washes.My son carries them around everywhere.I like that this mattress is very firm and has square corners that fit snugly in the crib (we have a Graco Shelby crib).I just recently purchased this mattress after a lot of research.I am overall happy with this mattress and its practicality.Here are the specs from Sealys web site:*Soy based foam-core offers improved durability over conventional foams and uses renewable resources resulting in the use of less crude oils.Also available are additional Sealy soybean foam crib mattresses models with fabric covers including the Soybean Dream.Hope this helps!I've done a ton of research on organic mattresses.The costs are very high.The mattress is very light.Once out of the package, it actually looks like a coiled mattress.The mattress is firm and sturdy without feeling like a board and sheets go on easily.The fact that my son will even nap on this thing earns a thumbs up from me!ETA 2013 Over three years later and this mattress is still going strong.Great investment!They show EVERYTHING, but I got over it because it's a baby thing.Mocha or not, they work beautifully and make my little one very happy.Don't expect them to prevent blow-outs.They fit right over the all-in-ones and pocket diapers I use.PERFECT for stopping leaks.These are the first reusable baby wipes I have used and they are ok. At first I thought they were super soft, but one wash roughed them up a bit.we like these just fine.These have been great wipes.I love these wipes!I had purchased 3 packs of these, but since they are large and work well, I could have gotten by with 2 packs as I wash diapers every 1 - 2 days.I bought more cotton pads to replace these.These nursing pads are fine; they do the job.It was how they felt.I never leaked through these, but of course if you leak enough, any washable pad without some kind of waterproof backing is going to leak through.My recommendation there is to double up.Also, I never had any trouble washing these pads, but I would recommend using a mesh lingerie bag so they don.t get lost.I prefer the Medela nursing pads--they are softer and contoured (they still show through a shirt, but they are much more comfortable).I've been using these nursing pads for about 3 weeks now and I have no complaints.I really like the material, first of all (I love Babykicks hemp/cotton blend).This is more or less true because the pads are thicker (they're actual cloth, so they have to be!).Anyway, I like these pads very much and would recommend them to anyone.Cheers.I now only use these in a pinch, I use BumGenuis mostly and other prefolds instead.I use these to lay on the ground when I want to give her some naked time.It says they work w/ Snappis but they pop right off.Snappis just don't work with these diapers.We are sticking with our Chinese prefolds and our favorites, Bummis Prefold Diapers.Oh and we tried them with safety pins - ugh trying to get pins through thick diapers is not fun.I love these diapers!They are great on my supersoaker baby boy.I specifically bought these as night time diapers anyway so I don't mind that it's not very versatile for active baby time.They take just as much drying time as my indian cotton twill prefolds.I'll definitely be getting them in the next size up because it's so absorbent.NOTE:  like any prefold that is made with a natural fiber, they must be "prepped."They are very absorbent now and not as bulky since she's grown into them.Although pricey, well worth it.I love these diapers.Don't get stained by poos (my daughter is on solids now and still no stains).Cons:1.I think the sizing runs a little small, we've been using size medium since my daughter was 17lbs.She is now 19lbs, and there isn't a whole lot of material to spare.These inserts are great.With these three inserts she only leaks a tiny bit, if at all.I actually purchased these large inserts to go into my daughter's Happy Heinys training pants (these are pocket trainers).They work perfectly and are a great fit.Wonderful quality, wash up and hold up very very well and are very absorbent.we use them in gdiapers and to double up for nighttime in bum genius.Highly recommend!I primarily use these as doublers in my son's nighttime diapers (1 hemp insert + 1 microfiber insert).Even with the hourglass shape I felt these were way too wide for between my baby's legs.They are even wider than the feminine pads I buy myself.I'm only giving them three stars because size small should be smaller.I'm quite pleased with my baby kicks.No leaks yet.These are two hour-glass shaped pads with two layers each, sewn together at the tag.The hemp does shrink in the wash, but they're sized quite amply to accommodate for that.That way, I could put in an odd number of layers if I needed to.I might actually snip the stitches at the tag to do this for myself.Good image, good zoom, good sound.the 360 of the cam is great!!!When I bought at amazon, delivery date was past 3 days when I called the manufacturer, since I didn't have the tracking number.I called then again asking for details they said that it was not shipped.I did not give up on the item because I have read good reviews before and really wanted this model.It sees great at night (not in color), no blinking lights, very portable, Can go outside and still see her, no delay in the image.LOVE IT.I got so used to the old one, where I could hear when my son was moving around in his bed, and it picked up every noise.I was viewing the monitor on this new one, and seeing that my son was moving around, however, I couldn't hear a thing!This is unacceptable to me.Good clarity at night with the "night vision" feature.I put a piece of duct tape over it so at night when I'm trying to sleep there isn't a bright red light flashing!I called customer service, who were nice, but said there was nothing they could do since it was out of warrenty.This so far has no static.This also interferes with my wireless connection.But I turn it on when I want to take a peek at my kid, then turn it off.Also, I rarely turn the volume on.I mean, it's awesome, but not THAT awesome.Maybe in the future the image will be picture perfect, but for now, it's kind of pixel-y.My toddler looks like a demon with glowing eyes in the night view.The first time it scared me but now he hardly looks at the camera anymore.In short, minus one star for pixel-y night time image and the inability to see child's chest rise and fall, and interference with wireless connection.But my husband says we can switch the wireless so we'll see how that goes.There are only two downsides I found: the hand held is kind of bulky but I usually just have it set up so it isn't a big deal and also that there is not a "talk" button where you can talk to the baby through the hand held.Overall I highly recommend this it gives me a great view of my baby when I'm not in his room.I read and read about them, then bought and returned a couple.We've been using this monitor for all of a day but I'm really pleased so far.The set up was really simple and it's very easy to use.I agree with all of the other complaints about the LED lights being too many and too bright.We have been using this monitor for 3 months with NO complaints!Here's what I love about it:1.The brightness and volume are easy to adjust.5.The camera is so sensitive, it picks up the slightest noise and makes it audible.So far it's been wonderful.I love it.It's perfect.I heard people complain about interference, but we haven't had any thus far.We started with an audio only monitor that was fine but lost the transmitter when traveling and were on the market for a new monitor when our son was 5 months old.Most importantly it allows us to see whether he really needs us when he's making noise.Second, it's downright amusing to see what he's up to and also just reassuring and sweet to be able to look at him at any time with the touch of a button.The video quality exceeded my expectations.The image is black and white, it's only color with light in the room.In complete darkness I can't believe how good the image is, but it's a little grainy so it depends on your expectations.I also bought this model in particular because I wanted the digital feature for privacy reasons.It doesn't bother me greatly but it would be much more convenient to have a readily accessible knob or something instead.Great for peace of mind...really great when you don't have to climb the stairs and wake the baby by opening the door and checking on him.Color and sound are great.My daughter did not have a video monitor because she wouldn't be able to see her twins when they were in separate cribs.There is also the time her son took off his diaper and it would have been nice to know this before he threw the contents at his sister, but I digress!I bought this system for her since it has the ability to pan the room and she can see each baby.It can also have an additional monitor so she can use it when they have separate rooms.She does have one complaint.My old eyes can see the screen better than they can on another I have tried.Sometimes he goes into his sister's crib and sits on her as she sleeps.We just wish we could have hooked it up to the "jumbo-tron" so the whole family could watch when we were gathered for Christmas!This is a wonderful monitor!!The zoom,pan and scan options are awesome to say the least.We have it for our 6 month old baby girl, and it helps us spend more quality time together.LOVES LOVES LOVES!!It's nice to peek in on her during naptime and nighttime and not have to risk waking her up.yes, you need to adjust the volume in the menu, but you only hit the menu button once and that's the first thing that appears, so not that big of a deal.The motor in the unit is silent, so it does not disturb baby.I have an older Summer model in the house that gets a lot of interference, but this one comes through crystal clear, no matter where I am in my two-level house.My only peeve is the auto-shut off of the video every few minutes.This does not happen if the unit is plugged in.The size of this hamper is actually pretty good.I had bought a Baby Trend infant carrier before and was disappointed with the cheapness of the quality of fabric.Not so for this wonderful stroller.My Baby Trend double jogger is truely a Godsend (ok since grandma bought it - it is a Goddess send :).Unlike one of the 300 reviews I read on it before buying it - it accomodates my HUGE toddler (95% for size) very well.I was prepared for the front wheel to shake - which it did just now for the first time on our walk, and I am confidant it will be fixed with a tightening of the nut , just like it has for everyone else that has posted about this wonderful stroller.The breaks are just wonderful on the Baby Trend.The underneath basket is has plenty of room, not tons, but plenty.And the parent compartment on top shuts which is very nice if we get just a bit of rain.The recline is perfect too.I think I might beam about this stroller more that people do about their Bob's or Phil & Ted's.I wish I had bought it 7 months ago.Happy strollin!ps it did fit thru a narrow doorway I wasn't so sure about.I am not sure if it would fit thru every narrow doorway - but it did in one of our towns teeny healthfood storesHappy travelsMy son is now almost 8 months old, and my daughter is 2 1/2.They BOTH love this seat, as do I!At a young age, my son had a flat spot on his head.I read reviews, and decided it would be worth a try.It is definitely worth it for all that it does.My son started sitting in it at about 3 months, and, because he was off his head, his head is now perfectly round.He enjoyed having something like what his sister was doing.It's wonderful to know that even if he is unhappy, he is safe.It's super quick to attach, has a buckle, and is the perfect height to the table.LOVE it.It's really funny to see her in there, but they are definitely accurate in lising this product to go up in age as far as it does.I would definitely buy this again for myself or for a baby shower gift.It's a fantastic little seat, and lasts through multiple ages and stages.I bought this for my son just shy of his 3rd month.This was perfect for him.The base is sturdy and I have had no problems with tipping over or anything.It comes with a formed foam insert for use when the baby is smaller and needs a little extra support.It locks the child in (along with the seat belt), it has two cup holders with a space to lay snacks, and it comes with four toys that attach securely to it.We have twins and they both love this!It was recommended by a child physical therapist.I have this seat and the bumbo.Here's my observation of my 3 1/2 month son in each:BUMBO+ Made of sturdy polyeurophane (sp?)My sister in law used it as a high chair for her little boy when she was visiting and it was perfect.It's small enough to move it around.We all think about the latch side, but it's easy to forget that little hands can get smashed in the hinge side, too.This is the perfect solution.We have been using ours for over a year, and they still work great.They just get a crack at the top.It works great for that!These do a great job of keeping the door from closing (and therefore pinching little fingers) and are easy to install and remove.The one issue I see though is that since they are not solid they do bend and with a hard enough slam or with repeatedly closing the door too much too often they look like they will likely start to crack based on the way they are bending.The material is well put together, beautiful, and feminine.I'm always impressed by the speed of Amazon's delivery, the package arrived quickly.We did have to iron the bed skirt, but that was no big deal.This is an adorable set for a baby girl!We'll see how it feels after I wash it a few times.The latter two leaked and my husband and I would often find ourselves mopping up milk stains anywhere we fed our son.Additionally, the Born Free Bottle parts are easy to disassemble and clean.Dr. Brown's bottles are VERY tough to clean even with the mini brush they give for cleaning the venting tubes.The one thing we are most impressed with are the accessories that are available with the Born Free bottles.I've taken pliers several times to try to squeeze the links together to keep them from falling apart.This thing is amazing.I put in a cup of coffee while taking my son for a walk.It never needs batteries, as it operates using the power of your own motion.Brilliant.Being a parent doesn't leave you with much time for cleaning cups.I LOVE MY UPPA BABY VISTA!What an awful design surprising from a company that creates the most useful stroller I have found (after much research I might add!By the way the whole issue with the chains allowing the drinks to move along bumpy roads is a lie.With this one you hear that "click", knowing your baby is securely locked in.Easy.To take off the adapter you simply press both buttons and it comes right off.It is lightweight and sturdy.The adapter appears to be white in the picture, but it is indeed matte black and matches perfectly with the Uppababy Stroller.This works great.There are labels on the device telling you which way to face it.No problems and it works great with my chico keyfit 30.I bought this to prevent my 1 year old from launching his cup at meals.As long as I use that wider cups, this works very well.This is very nice and soft, and fits the mini co-sleeper perfectly.The edges are piped, so it is a nice, taught fit.Also, the underneath has Velcro to secure the mattress to the co sleeper frame, which makes it very secure - no chance of the mattress shifting and creating a gap between the edge and the co sleeper itself.And yes, you can wash it in the dryer.So anyway the box comes in and I open it up, pull out one of diapers and look straight through it.Well I know that you should wash your diaper's four or five times in hot water so I tried this.Nope, it didn't help a bit.I am happy to have found these here.I have not used them as diapers but we use these ALOT for burping, wiping spit up, wiping tears from face...etc.I love that it has stroller attachments included, you can use tote straps or messenger strap, and there are plenty large pockets inside.The long strap goes nicely over your shoulder and is padded.The many pockets are great and it comes with a changing pad.We both love this bag, so many pockets and we love the stroller clips!Changing pad included.Lots of interior pockets to help separate the wipes from the binky!I love the colors of the slipcover.They are light enough to where they are not overwhelming.Overall I am pleased with it.This fabric is strangely rough.(It started ripping after just a few months of rotating use, so not even full time use.)There's a huge difference in the softness.It's been helpful in keeping a nice head shape!Love this item!We purchased 2 (I bought another one a week later for his daycare use).My only wish is that I knew about this sooner.A great gift for any new family who will be as paranoid about SIDS as we are due to the "back" to sleep campaign.I purchased this item on the recommendation of my Peditrician and have been pleased with it.It's not completely round again but it's so much better!Also used it in the bouncy seat.Anyways, I think it is a good feature on this Boppy Head Support.Word to the wise, though.Just probably every couple of days or so instead of daily.With the combination of some stretching exercises that her pediatrician showed us, the torticollis has greatly improved and the shape of her head is almost perfect now.I initially used this at night time in the crib.I was given these bottles as a gift.After only one or two uses and washes, the top of the nipple (where there should just be a small hole) cracks open.The second problem is that the glass gets very warm when you heat the bottles, and there is no sleeve or any other barrier between the bottle and your hand.Instead of these bottles, I highly recommend the Life Factory weego glass bottles.Lifefactory BPA-Free Glass Baby Bottle-4 Pack (9 oz.- Raspberry and Pink)Upon repeated uses, the nipples of the Life Factory bottles are in tact, and the silicone sleeve prevents slipping and provides a bit of insulation between the bottle and your hand.I haven't had any crack or break on me yet, so the durability on these is strong!Don't know what to say about it, I mean you go potty in it and it works.You can't change the language it says english french and spanish interchangably.My daughter LOVES Elmo and he delivers, as always, with the potty chair!He talks in both English and Spanish!The tray is easy to remove and clean.With very few crevices or tiny places, clean up is quick and easy.I've used this potty chair for two boys and it's held up great.Also, I removed the splash guard thingy in front because it just got in my boys' way.I am now looking at getting the Contigo Kids Autoseal (for older kids but 2 1/2 year olds should be able to push the button).But most sippy cups aren't completely leak proof.They are great cups!I like the design and it provides a nice place to put my baby.You definitely want to stay near your baby, but I like the strap system.If there is someone with you to hold the baby for a minute or if your child can stand, then this probably wouldn't be as big of a deal.I doubt it keeps every germ from your baby, but since my daughter is teething it's nice that she isn't chewing on the cart itself!Overall I am very pleased with it.I got this as a present from my aunt when my baby was 3 months old, he is now 15 months, he no longer fits comfortably, but it has been a great gift to receive!It's sturdy in each place with hardware mounts or not.Our one year old that is the size of a two year old hasn't figured it out & is able to tug and pull on them and not dislodge one.It's not as sturdy when it's taken to it's width limits, we have stairs that are too narrow for the extension but almost too wide for the gate by itself & it doesn't feel as sturdy but still holds up.We've gotten a lot of good use of these gates and they work fine for our family.I highly recommend this gate.We get so many compliments on the gate as well.(the gate DOES come with hardware mounts though if you prefer)This gate is great and we feel it's a good value.It operates easily,couldn't have been easier to assemble and attaches securely.Our 5 month old daughter pulls herself up on it and it doesn't budge and just the other day we had a very large 18mo old boy at our house and he was pulling on it and it still didn't move.I think there had been a previous version of this gate where a child had gotten their finger injured in it, but after inspecting the latching system thoroughly and even letting it slam shut on my own finger (it couldn't) I really can't see how anyone child or adult could be injured.We wanted to get a second one of these gates because they're so great and we got what we thought was the same gate we bought in 2010 when I first wrote the review, but opened the box and nope!Not exactly the same, a newer model (the one pictured) which does NOT have the same operating mechanism and does NOT come with the same number of extensions and thus does not expand as far!This new model, after you slide back the thumb lever, you have to use your other hand to lift up another latch to be able to open the gate.Any parent knows you're going to be carrying kid+stuff a lot of the time and a gate you have to use two hands to open is a deal breaker for us!I wish it would swing open both ways, that really was the deal breaker for me.Since this gate was just to keep our puppy confined to the kitchen while he's being housetrained, we didn't want to spend a ton of money on the gate.It's not the most sturdy gate, but it seems sturdy enough to keep our puppy confined.Note that we used the extensions - I think if your doorway was narrow enough that you didn't need the extensions, though, that this gate would be fairly sturdy and easy to install.Okay, so we originally bought the mirror that has the remote but was very plain (black and gray) that has music and a light - and HATED it!We have a Britax car seat so it's a bit larger than most car seats so the seat has to lean back further in our Armada.Because of this the mirror was always falling and the actual mirror part was too small to see him when it was upright.It stays upright on the seat and my son loves the colors and toys.The shape in AMAZING!I can actually see my son.It stands vertically verses the horizontal and it shows his face and body - I LOVE THAT FEATURE!Also even though it doesn't have a remote (I wish it did) you are able to set how long the music plays for so its not on the whole ride.This would have been PERFECT if it had a remote and a light but I still gave it 5 stars because compared to others it truly is perfect to me.I found out Amazon accepts return for 365days so I'm just now trying to return the replacement, I will get refund this time instead of replacement...Ordered this for my son and DIL and of course the wee grandbaby.Kids are petri dishes for illness.My DIL loves it and it goes along with them easily.Generous coverage.Wonderful bright color.Thought sbout a more substantially padded one but this works well and little-girl won't grow out of it so fast either.A great value for the price!I love that this is versatile and fits many chairs easily and that it's easy to wipe clean.Worth the few extra bucks.But otherwise, it's great!My husband & I had the hardest time picking a stroller/car seat combo.This was our first baby, so we had no idea what qualities would be important to us.Lightweight?Comfort for us & baby?Which mattered more & which "cons" should we give the most credence to?There is no perfect item out there - the Chicco is as close to perfect as we felt we could get - we love it, and we'd buy it again.THE BIG PICTURE:1.This is a GREAT stroller for the price range.It rides great - inside & outside.It is easy to clean, and the fabric choices are stylish.4.It is comfortable for the baby.Yes, the fabric is warm, (some of the styles of Chicco even seem hotter than others, go see them in person first), but so are pretty much all carseat fabrics (and swing and high chair fabrics).We bought the "Cubes" and are happy with that fabric and pattern.It is summer in Texas and the baby sweats a bit on her back.We have not had any trouble with the straps being too tight or too loose, brakes not working, or wheels squeaking.Yes, it is heavier than some models.The seat feels heavier than the stroller.We always used a hand basket for shopping - it is easy enough to maneuver the stroller with one hand, and we never felt comfortable putting shopping items under the stroller.(Sometimes they specifically checked for that).5.However, if you are at the mall, etc., not many bumps there, and if you are outside, you can attach a water bottle to a mommy hook.Disclaimer:  We have owned this for 5 months now, it is holding up perfectly so far.This walker is wonderful.My son is 4 months old, 16.7 lbs and 27 inches long.This one allows him to stand on the floor and he can actually move around.This is perfect!!And the colors (the blue) are super cute.I bought this one at the urging of my husband who said that Chicco was a good brand.But this walker is awesome!The activity tray has three different settings so I can change it up and not always hear the same sounds.It adjusts easily, and my baby loves it.Although it was nice looking, it only had 2 height settings and even the highest setting could not accomodate my son who's knees were bent as he strolled around the store aisle.Not only did people & their babies love it, but it was [...] cheaper than the car.Why I love it:1.The middle setting is perfect for him and it makes us feel good to know that there is still a higher setting left.2.Sturdy:  It's really well put together all around.My son bumps into the furniture all of the time and the walker never tilts.It also has brake pads below it which is an added safety feature.Lots of lights, music, drum beats, animal noises.Color really doesn't matter to me but if it matters to you, you may want to look into it further.4.The walker easily flattens with the pull of a lever and press of a button for easy transport or for storage.5.Baby loves it!What I don't like so much (which is why I took off a star):1.Adjusting the height setting can be tricky.I usually eye it.2.My son is 4 months old, and already sits in it.It helps him get more strength in his legs.He loved it but, as a longer baby was already too tall for it at 6 months (he was 27" then).It honestly is such a great design for that.It has been great for him and us alike.It has been worth the months of giggles and joy.I LOVE this stroller!Incredible value for a safe, fully functional, lightweight stroller.PROS+ Fully reclines!And it does so VERY easily!Perfect for newborns or sleeping babies.+ 5 point harness.This makes this stroller safer than many others and allows it to be used from birth to toddler, saving you money.+ Easy to fold up.+ Front wheels come off for storage in small places.+ Wipes clean easily.+ Smooth ride.CONS- Limited color selection.I dislike all of the color choices.I bought blue and have started to grow to like it.(But you can repair that easily with tennis racket tape.)I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this stroller.It's SUPER light and I can carry it and put it away with ONE hand.It folds up nicely (super easy!!)and compact in my Honda Accord and takes up LITTLE room.It also has a GREAT size basket for an umbrella type stroller.I love that it fully reclines - such a great, extra feature!One of the best gifts we've recieved for our son and family!When I got home and opened it...I fell in love.This is such a great stroller.I don't kick the wheels when I walk behind it and the handles are in the perfect position.Everything else is a bonus...the padding in the seats for comfort, the basket that doubles as a rain guard, the easy fold away.I know only have a day but I'm very happy with I tryed it already.I'll keep you updated about itWe're still using them every day and I've been very happy with the purchase.The lid is very secure and truly leak proof.It isn't as insulated as a thermos so it won't keep anything warm or cold for very long but otherwise it works very well.We've since bought an extra bento box to have because we use it so much.Those also work very well.But the set was worth it to me for the bento box and the bowls.It's by far the best piece of the set.The helmet seemed a necessity once the baby started pulling up.Unless the head bump causes a concussion, the medical profession is useless.So my guy started crawling at 6 mo, standing at 7 mo and walking by 9 mo.The leather seats!We had always owned a car with cloth and yes while it would indent with our daughters seat it would also come out.It's nice because while she was rear facing we could just double up the bottom protection, but when she turned around and faced forward we could put it upright and protect the back and bottom of the seat.Also the top is a Lycra material- smooth while the bottom is rubber to keep it from sliding.There are three different mattress positions and we decided to start the baby on the middle one.It appears to be rather sturdy.It's a little larger than I would like for our small nursery, but the size is comparable to other 4-in-1/sleigh style cribs you'll see in baby stores.I've updated my scoring to 5 stars.He'll soon be handing it over to his little brother and the crib has still held up well.(It has survived being taken apart and put back together twice.I have no concerns about moving it again to another room.)If you don't have a lot of space, the sleigh style might not be for you.I actually only use it on emergency cases... but so far, it was a good buy!Then tried "simpler" nipples like Soothie, Gerber, and Adiri, etc that have the smooth "unshaped" nipple.No luck -- the flows were too fast and he didn't seem to like the shape, because he couldn't keep them in his mouth.The flow was perfect.SUCCESS, finally!Hope this helps!We HIGHLY recommend it!Switched to NUK bottles and she had no problem moving up to the Medium flow eventhough Im breastfeeding.I introduced the bottle at 5 weeks and almost felt defeated after trying another brand popular for breastfeed babies.It has been the easiest cup for my daughter to use, as we've been transitioning to a sippy from the bottle.Otherwise, it has been the easiest trainer cup (and we have tried many brands) for my daughter!I can't say enough good things about these swaddle blankets.I just love them.But these little blankets make swaddling so easy that anyone can do it.Swaddling helps our baby to calm easier (ala "Happiest Baby on The Block" -- if you don't know that book, look it up, it's a perfect companion gift with this wrap).I wish that we had bought two for those early days when she was spitting up so much so that I could always have one on her when I needed it, even if the other was in the laundry.You might watch the nurse swaddle your baby with a receiving blanket and say, "why do I need something more expensive?"but you will be very, very happy to have the velcro on this.It's easy to bind up your squirming baby with the swaddle-me, and it stays put so that she won't wriggle out too soon.I love that it's easy.I love that it's effective.I love that it has landing-strips for the velcro so that it doesn't ruin all the other items in your laundry.My only complaint is that it does not last very long.Don't count on using it for your next baby, and realize that a hand-me-down might not hold as well as a new one.Go for a lighter material in warm climbs.I wash all new items before introducing my infant to them.I removed the item from the washer and to my surprise the outer shell was slightly torn.love the soft fleece lining the inside of the car seat, even when not using the top part (which easily unzips off).nice for fall/spring, can add a blanket inside for colder months.convenience of not having blankets falling off.color is nice.The first time I used this it seemed to be a dream come true.The next day, I tried to use it and the suction wouldn't work anymore, no matter what I did.I purchased this aspirator to spare myself the suction on the regular one, but i went back to using the pigeon one as it's more effective.The music is a great distraction but the suction is not so great.I guess you;re better off with the usual aspirator and i would highly recommend the pigeon one because it works wonders with my baby.Item worked about as well as the bulb syringe, but didn't make my baby nearly as angry.The straps are super easy to use, and the buckles are nice and secure.The best part about this Beco carrier is that the baby is not hanging out forward facing instead they are in a natural position that supports their hips & back and yours so you both are comfortable.In a stroller strangers are free to come up to your baby and touch them, but when you have them in the Beco close and secure to you, you control access to them.I love my Beco Butterfly!I only wish I had purchased one sooner!I have carried both my infant son in it and my 35 lb.2 year old!I get so many compliments on my Beco!This carrier is perfect for both me and my husband.The Beco is easy to use, comfortable to wear, and our daughter is securely held in it.I keep giving this to my friends as a shower gift.I think this pacifier pod is perfect.I ended up keeping the binky on a clip that hooked to the baby's clothes whenever we went out.He's only around 6 lbs, so he fits perfectly into the changing station.The changing station is also easy to wipe down and clean for any blow outs and other diaper changing incidents.We installed the bassinet feature underneath and store all our extra clothes, cloths, shirts, blankets etc underneath the napper and changer for easy grabbing access.There are some faults to this pack n play, but for us this one is perfect.We know we're moving in 6 months time, so this is the perfect 'crib' set until we can get something more permanent.This pack n play has been a life saver for us.Obviously this was not going to work.Plus the sounds and vibrations are great as well and can be use with or without the timer feature.I bought this in Summer 2009 and chose it over other Graco pack-n-plays since it had the newborn napper.Also, it was difficult to assemble, my husband finally was able to put it together but he complained that the instructions were terrible.For the price I paid, I am still happy with it.It has held up well and the colors will allow me to use for either girl or boy if we have another baby in the future.My son goes to the day care since he was 6 months old.I use this storage containers to send him variety of foods everday.The diaper bag is so much easier to carry around instead of having 4 diff containers rolling inside.Easy to use, washes well in the dishwasher.I would recommend it for any age.Easy to open, give him a snack and snap the lid on.My son started sitting and crawling so I got this helmet to protect his head and I know that no matter how closely I watch him he would have ended up in the emergency room without this helmet!This is a great way to protect your baby yet they still need constant supervision because it doesn't protect their face or chin or body in general from harm.The helmet does make their head sweat so I would recommend using it for 20-30 minutes and then taking it off for a while.My son is 7 months old and the helmet is too big for him so I pinched the elastic on the back and used two safety pins to make it smaller and it fits fine.Well worth the price to protect your baby for years!!If I could give it more stars I would!!These were given to me for my baby shower, and after my son was born, I found myself searching in the clothing basket for them over the 20 other clean blankets that we had.I just love how soft they are.They hold up so well, he is seven months old and still only uses them as blankets.I ended up ordering 6 more.I wish they made them in big people sizes!They wash well, too.I purchased this at the last minute before my daughter was born since we had a moses basket for her.I'm so happy we got it.Not only was it so simple to assemble but it is wonderful to take from room to room during the day for her to sleep in.I have even taken it in the bathroom while I was in the shower.I highly recommend this to anyone planning on using a moses basket, especially if you want something that doesn't take up a lot of room.I can see where people might say it pinches because although it's not supposed to bend anymore in that direction, it does, and could possibly pinch.I'm definitely going to buy one of these for my son when he's potty training!I bought this to use with breastmilk for my baby at daycare.I was really excited to get these bottles because I was giving my son some breastmilk bottles daily.While I found he did not have any issues with "nipple confusion", and the bottles were easy to clean, I did have some issues and ended up changing brands.Finally, my son was gassier w/these bottles than the Dr. Brown ones.At first, I was very impressed that they improved her latch and she didn't appear to have much gas from taking the bottle.The outer, clear nipple was still in perfect shape but the inner, blue nipple was deteriorating.I told her that I was using a nipple brush to clean the inside of the nipples but that there was no other way to get to the very tip of the inside.My only complaint is that I can't get more caps and collars, just nipples.I used these with my son in 2007(Oh this account is in my husband's name BTW) and he breastfed just fine, I used Philips AVENT with my daughter in 1998, b/c these weren't invented yet, and she refused to brestfeed after having one bottle.I came back to order some more for my next baby due in October!Everyone in my family laughed at these bottles b/c of the two nipple design, but who cares-they work!My 4-month old is much happier laying in the same position on something that's much softer, like a boppy pillow (which we don't have, but he likes the one at his daycare).We received this as a gift for our then, 6 month old son.Lots of fun.They come in a set of three, each with a different top for different water streams.CoosWell priced (about $10).Each toy unscrews for easy cleaning (less likely to "toss" for mold and mildew).Interchangeable pieces (kids can create different combinations).3 toys in the set, but there are 6 pieces for play (each "bottom" makes a cup...what kid doesn't love a cup?).Three different texture and design "tops."BpA-free, Phthalate-free and PVC-freePretty cool.Kids seem to enjoy their simplicity which encourages more creative play.BoosThere are only three in a set (we would like more please).Slightly higher priced than other bath toys (but we think these are cooler).The shape can be a little awkward to grasp and squeeze for some little hands (does get better as fine motor skills increase).The Petite Consumer Says: We "dig" the cool designs and creative play.These are fun for in and out of the tub.This Pod is great to have just a couple of diapers and a travel wipes case.I love this one because it's small and compact and easy to put in the diaper bag.So when I need to make a trip to the bathroom, I can leave the bag in the stroller with my husband and take just this.Most of the time my toddler son carries it for me and his baby brother.:DMy only complaint is it didn't come with a wipes case.Or now that my older one is potty trained, I can comfortably fit three size 4 diapers with the case.I keep the matching pad in the pocket on the side of the case.This is NOT made for long trips.It's hardly fair to complain about it being small.If you just need a few diapers because you're running here and there and don't do that many changes while you're out, then this is perfect.If you're going to Disneyland, then pack a bunch of diapers in your diaper bag.Also, if you're very concerned about germs, then you'll probably think the pad is too small.It fits a newborn perfectly.If I think the bathroom is less then clean, I'll change him in the car or use an antibacterial wipe on the surface before I lay him down.Mostly I'm just worried about keeping his sensitive parts off the surface and not passing butt germs on to the next kid.Bring a blanket if that's what you need.And it's super sturdy!I've had it for about a year now and it still looks new!Can't deny that.This is a great short excursion tote, well constructed and cool looking.I love this pod!Wish I had it sooner.It is perfect and very practical when you don't want or need to carry a full diaper bag around.I fit 4 size 5 diapers and a travel size (soft sided) pack of wipes in it without a problem.The pad is small, but his but fits fine and he is two years old now.A big cushie pad would not be this portable!I love this!It's cute and stylish to boot!Love it!When I have my 2nd child in a couple months, I plan to use this in the large diaper bag with all my older son's things still in it, so I can keep their diaper sizes separate and easy to find.Other reviewers commented that the mirrors don't face the baby and that they cant be moved after they are placed So after inspecting the design my husband decided to shave a tiny piece of plastic off the bottom of the mirror stand.(a piece that locks the mirror into a rear facing position) before snapping the mirrors into the sockets.We have been using it for about 3 days now and my 4 month old son seems to really enjoy the lights and sounds.I got this to use on the subway and trips where the stroller just isn't easy to take.I also received the fanny pack attachment as a gift and when it is warm it makes moving with my daughter easy.They are easy to put together.we purchased extra bottles separately just so we wouldn't need to wash parts so often.these bottles also prevent having a gassy baby since you have to physically push the extra air out of the liner before feeding.overall, wonderful bottles.Super easy to throw away the liner and not have to carry multiple bottles with you.The fabric is 100% cotton and silky to the touch so it does not irritate you or baby's skin.We only use bottles occasionally, but this system is best.She just could never get the natural shape ones right they leaked out the corners of her mouth all over the place!I used the older style ventaire with my boys and loved it, but never really liked this new style of vent until I got this bottle.Very happy with it, works great and she spits up less with these than with the drop-ins.We have this fountain and the Flow N Fill spout by the same company.As the pump has seized, this will take a little bit of force and then it will spin freely and start right up.He still loves to play with it everytime.We have owned this tub organizer for almost a year, and it is still doing well.The suction cups grip well on our shower wall, and even when stuffed full of toys (and handled a little roughly by a two year old) it has stayed in place.The soft material means that it can change shape to accommodate toys of different shapes and sizes, while taking up the least amount of space.Overall, a great purchase for our household!An hour later, and it's holding up great!It's exactly what I was looking for as far as my son's bath toys go, so I'm very pleased...It's a very cute light blue, great material, with enough mesh for all the water to drain out of the toys, and not at all bulky like I thought it might be.It was worth the effort to get it to attach so if you are having problems getting it to stick, a good old fashioned scrub down with a scrub brush should do the trick!They didn't seem particularly tenacious.:)  Choose your color and there you go!Not only does the orange go perfectly with our boys' jungle bathroom, but it holds the insane amount of bath toys we have.Impressive!I honestly have never run it through the wash as it smells good (I rinse it with the shower every so often); it smells like our kids' Burt's Bees Shampoo and Body Wash.The mesh bag is falling apart and ripping, after only having the bag for 6 months and washing it maybe 10 times?This item is terrific.It is also very cool looking.I am pleased with this purchase.Be warned, if your tile is not 100% smooth this will not stick.Our tile is the modern xlarge tiles and it has a very slight texture to it.I bought this wipes warmer since I thought it would fit nicely in my suitcase when we go to visit family.It is compact, but honestly it's too compact.You can change about 2 diapers before you have to refill it, and it doesn't even keep the wipes warm.Furthermore, since it is so lightweight, each time you go to pick up a wipe you end up picking up the whole dispenser.I was so happy to find a wipe warmer that didn't need pillows or any other items to make it work.You just put the wipes in and then plug it in and they are warm.But after 2 months, it started to pop open or refusing to close every so often.This a nice travel warmer, but for when you are like away not for running errands since the case is bulky and the wipes don't stay warm after is unpluged, is great if you just changing your baby in the vehicle, I like it so far I just got this cause I'll be traveling and my son is used to warmed wipes at home wich I have a bigger warmer another brand and I just love it.my only complaint about this warmer is the rubber dispenser where the wipes are suposed to pop out rip the wipes and I cannot get them to pop, I've tried many differents settings for the wipes, when this is the only reason I ordered this one instead of the other brand that you have to open the whole warmer and pre separate the wipes to place them in.You can't really appreciate this until you try carrying a screaming little one in one arm to the bathroom to get warm water for a washcloth in the middle of the night.This holds at least a dozen cloth wipes, but we don't roll them like the pictures show.They stay warm and wet, and are ready to go whenever you need them.The light glows, but isn't really enough to light a dark room, and so far the anti-microbial pad seems to be keeping things clean and moist in there.Instead, we use baby washcloths (mostly the Gerber) and bleach them, then rinse wash.Even counting the wipes in this one, it's still a 5 star item in my opinion.This warmer is great, even if you don't use the cloth wipes.I purchased this model because I thought we might use cloth wipes and wanted to have that option.Right now we are usingPampers Sensitive Thick Care Wipes Refill, 180-Count Pouches (Pack of 4) (720 Wipes)and they work well with this warmer.I give this warmer my highest recommendation.2) you can't fill it with more then 10-12 wipes or they won't get warm at all.Baby girl is three months old now and we use this wipes warmer daily.The cloth wipes that came with it are ok, but I prefer the fleece clothes I bought on Etsy.Warm and wet is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and mold so it is important that you keep the unit clean.I fill the unit with dry clothes and add about 3 cups of warm water with a tablespoon and baby wash and a couple of drops of tea tree oil (natural antibacterial).I use all of the wipes and then wipe down the unit and start fresh.When I first started using it I would just keeping adding wipes and water daily and that's when I would get the funk.If you can keep up with that you'll be very happy with the wipe warmer.There's nothing better at cleaning up ooky poop butt than a nice warm wet cloth.She loves it.I have both intense love and intense hate for this wipes warmer.Cloth wipes are fantastic, and I would highly recommend to anyone, and especially to cloth diaperers.The wipes provided with it have all unraveled at the edges.We use cloth diapers and wipes, and we needed a convenient way to keep the wipes moist for diaper changes.This warmer is perfect.It also holds a lot of wipes at once, so we don't have to refill too often.Great purchase overall.Highly recommended.I didn't have it before my baby was born and she would cry when the cold wipes touched her skin.There are recipes online for different wipe solutions some with lavender, tea tree oil, baby wash, etc.for your baby's skin.I don't always have it plugged in during the summer but it's still a nice place to hold your wet wipes.I'm glad to read some of the reviews of people owning this for years and it still working!I loved this warmer for my cloth wipes, but then the power cord quit working after about two weeks.I tried and tried to contact the company.They FINALLY called me back after over a month and no questions asked, they sent me a new power cord.They get very warm.I think another reviewer that said it will only heat a few is probably because they didn't have enough moisture in the warmer.I decided to switch to using cloth wipes about 10 days ago, so that says a lot for the timeliness of the shipping, but the condition the warmer arrived in was far less than satisfactory.I don't mind buying used items when they work, nor do I mind cleaning something of minor dirt, but when I bought something "new" I expect it to arrive that way.My little daughter enjoys her preheated wipes.I thought it would be a tad bigger, but it is the perfect size for her to keep in her crib and for transport.She does crawl over and play with it from time to time but I really wish I had not gone with the natural color!It is good quality.Purchased one of these in the natural color you see here, then also found one in the "color burst" variety.Ended up giving this away to a friend who just had a baby and saved the other one for my son.Great item!Easy for little ones to grab, hold on to, and manipulate.Because of it's design, this toy is really easy for young babies to grasp.The sound it makes when it's shaken is quite soothing, not jarring like some other rattles, so this doubles as a rattle, too.It's also great for taking along when you're traveling with your baby.Since it's squishable, it'll keep nicely in a bag without taking up a lot of space or getting damaged.Even my husband was fascinated by it for a few minutes!Even my husband who was against this loves the gate.It allows us to block off part of our house very easily.It blocks our bedrooms from the living area.It was pretty easy to install (took one star off because getting the width right was a little tricky), took my husband maybe 10 minutes or so.Many of our friends have other baby gates and they all love how easy this one it to use.Okay, so maybe I didn't read all the fine print carefully enough.My son loves rattles and like to shake them.Sassy and Manhattan Baby have some good selections.Because it is not "spill proof" he can actually get water out of the cup... cause + effect = reward!It will be my new standard baby shower gift!Highly recommend this sippy above all others!One of my friend recommended this combi cup, but I don't really like it.It has too many parts to put together and you have to lined up it perfectly, and even after you did all of that, it still leaks!!!After a while, black mold started growing in the straw and soft plastic parts.To wash it thoroughly I need to use Q-tip and the tiny brush from Dr. Brown's bottle.Yes it is beautiful, yes it is well made, BUT it is a little big for infant hands.My 8 month baby only sucks the ribbons then shake it for few seconds, and thats it.Okay so it's beautifully made, colors are vibrant, and it's easy for my 5 month old to grab onto it but I gave it 3 stars because of the price.I knew I was taking a chance on buying such and expensive toy for my son to love or to ignore.The one thing he does like are the ribbon extensions to chew on but they move to the inside where he's just to little to figure out how to take them out.My son went through a phase where he absolutely loved spinning stuff.He still loves it and will spin something if he see's it is spinnable...falls over and ceases to be interesting in any shape or form for my little one.Not sure if this is any better than any other vent system though since I have not tried any others.I've read tons of reviews and chose this one based on them and my own understanding of this design and others (admittedly, I'm not an engineer, just a doctor).Other systems with even less pieces seem to leak often.These bottles are fantastic; they work well with the MilkBank storage system and my daughter has no gassiness after she feeds from them.He's used to the Dr. Browns and actually took in more air with these bottles.Ok SO I bought these because a friend has them and she said they only leak sometimes, much better then the average bottles.It was hard to get a comfortable fit for me and also it was hard to get my baby in there and have her comfortable as well.By the way, I did make sure that I bought the right size.I give it 5 stars for the functionality.It's a wonderful, leak-proof sippy cup that is easy for my child to hold and drink out of.Everything comes apart and you can wash it, but it really takes a lot of work and time to clean out all the little corners and spaces.You have to buy a little tiny brush to scrub out the straw areas and the straw protector (the one the flips open and close).Pros:Good qualityDo not leakGood for travelCons:A lot of piecesNot too easy to cleanMy daughter loves these cups.They do not leak and are sturdy.The straw system in the cup comes apart in two pieces.All together the cup is five pieces.That was a long ride home.I would recommend this to a parent on the go.The other straw cup without the flip top from Munchkin is much better in terms of easy of use.I have both the Combi Mug Step 3 and the Munchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Sippy.I much prefer the Munchkin because it's easier to wash (I used my Dr. Brown tiny brush to clean the straw).It takes more effort to suck as other reviewers indicated, but my kid is fine with it.However, the one without the flip lid does not leak at all!I haven't had the trouble with leaking that other reviewers have mentioned.I think these cups are a very close second to the Playtex model, which I prefer but it's a little more expensive.Just two gripes: First, the flip top is too hard for my son to open, but easy for him to close.Second, you have to disassemble the flip top piece to put the straw back in.These cups are better than others I have tried but they still leak, particularly after a bit of use.They do flip shut securely and with a straw cup I think that's about all you can hope for.My son is very happy with them and usually drinks from them hands free with some strong suction.All in all, a good cup, we own six and I will probably give in and order about 6 more.It's true what they say, you can never have enough sippy cups.Great for their teeth but it still leaks some when they flip it over and shake it but I have yet to find one that doesn't.We introduced the Munchkin straw sippy cups to our twins when they were 12 months old.(Before this we had used primarily bottles; they never did well with either soft-spout or hard-spout sippy cups.)Within two weeks, we were able to ditch bottles and transition full-time to these straw sippy cups.Overall we're happy with these.They do randomly leak sometimes but for the most part they're fine.This is a good sippy cup in that it doesn't spill when tipped over and it's also easy to clean.The only thing I don't like about it is that my son likes to chew on the straw and it doesn't hold up.If you're child is not a biter or chewer this would be a great sippy cup.Fun colors and no spills!Worth the price and then some, I will be purchasing more of these.The flow isn't too fast like some other sippy cups with straws.It leaks a bit when you leave the straw open, but there are no leaks when you close the straw lid.You can easily take the whole thing apart to wash in all the nooks and crannies.My 18 moth old can open and close the flip top easily.Much better than the Nuby, which does not seem to come apart to wash.These are nice & light and nonbulky.We use the Playtex Straw cups at home because they are bulkier.My one year old sometimes throws things down from his carseat (that let's-test-gravity stage) and this holds up quite nicely without any spills.I love that the cups aren't too big (no sense in having kids supersize when adults shouldn't be doing it either).They don't leak and they're easy to hold for my 2 year old.When my son was ready to drink from a cup we tested them all.Now that he is teething he does chew at the tip.I think these cups will last.I started using these when my baby was a little over 1 year old, and this is her favorite sippy cup because it is easy to drink from.I like them because they do not leak, look nice, come in an 8 oz.The pieces are interchangeable between the different sizes, except that the straw, which only fits the 10 oz.We went back to our Born Free sippy cups.They work much better.These are great beginner cups.I've tried different cups with my son and he loves these cups the best.They have a soft top that is a great trasition between bottle and cup.I like the fabric design and the adjustable strap.The new one is great.Very nice looking and seems to be functional.But I am no happy!I like these cups.The cups claim to be 'spill proof' but I have noticed that if the cup is in the open position and laying on its' side, it usually leaks a little.I do suggest that you take the cup fully apart each night and let all the parts air dry - I had some mold in one of the straws - so make sure you take it fully apart and 'open' the valve part.My 15 mo old twin boys really love this cup!I purchased at target since amzn doesn't let you select girl vs boy colors.The design is really improved overthe previous version in terms of being easy to put together and take apart for the dishwasher.Yes, there is a vacuum set up when they suck, but if they take a break between sips you can hear air going in.These cups are amazing!We've been using the Munchkin straw sippy cups with our twins since they turned 1.I'm a bit shocked they only have 2.5 stars and wonder if the design has been improved recently or if others just didn't put them together correctly.If you're not allowed to specify a preference, they should use gender-neutral colors; I just ordered a set of these and received a set of pink flowered cups for my twin boys.While I like pink and flowers, I know when they're at the gym daycare, church nursery, etc., it's going to cause some confusion when they set the cups down and the nursery workers are looking around for a little girl to give them back to before they notice their names on the label.Not cool.They should at least let you order "Boy Colors," "Girl Colors" or "Gender-Neutral Colors."The old Playtex Insulated cup was my (and my son's) favorite cup.This is definately not one that I can count on.I have a two year old and one year old and both use this quite well.I think if your kid is already using the traditional sippy cup well, this is a nice progression.The cover over the straw is easy enough for my two year old to open & close without assistance.These are double walled so chilled beverages can keep cool better than single walled cups.These are easy to disassemble for cleaning with minimal parts.Perfect.However, if you own an orbit baby and looking at these, then that most likely isn't too much of an issue.These are great, they integrate well, stow away on the stroller and don't get in the way when the stroller is collapsed.Well thought out, although they are quite simple.The panniers accessory from the first generation of Orbit strollers has carried over to the Orbit Baby G2 line up.Despite having a black and mocha version, they decided not to introduce the textile in ruby colour to match the new ruby/red addition.The panniers are pricey, I agree.I had heard a lot of good things about bamboo wipes, more absorbent, sustainable, softer.While that maybe true, what good is a wipe if it falls apart on you?When cleaning up a diaper I prefer a bigger wipe but maybe that's just personal preference.I keep a lingerie bag next to the changing table and place used wipes in it.This has worked great, my baby is now 4 months old and we're still using the original wipes.The end result is a soft, warm wipe that smells great, softens baby's skin AND we've never had diaper rash!A couple have frayed at the edge but we still use them.These are great!does the job.Good little item.For a few bucks I can't complain.I has held all the air so far too, so I would really give it a 4.5 if that option was available.Our daughter is now 17 months, and she still loves it.Our daughter loves to put the different cups in the holder, or hold her hand under the water.It works for us every time, I've read some people had theirs stop working.My son loves this toy and the cups that come with it.I got this when my son was 17 months old and he loved it until it stopped working after about four months and he would cry "Yoo-kid -o"!My daughter who's 19 months is absolutely obsessed with this one!We've had it for a little over a month now, and she still loves it.It's a hit with our three year old as well as our one year old.It's been used daily for months and the batteries are still going strong.Two other family members had these for their kids.He has tons of bath toys, but loves this one!It really holds his attention, and thus far works great!The cups are great and the kids love to try and drink the water from the cups.I would recommend this to any parent whose kids enjoy playing with water.The suction cups are good, the unit is quiet, and the stream of water is just enough.The cups that come with it are adorable and fun and the entire unit is kid friendly.It's wonderfulSucks.I bought this for my 10 month old baby, since we transitioned her to taking baths in the big tub and decided she'd probably want something to play with.This toy made the perfect replacement!We just got it for my 20 month old son and he LOVES it.I have a 3 yr old and a 18 month old and they both love it.It works again.It's easy to set up and provides tons of fun in the bathtub.Note though that this toy eats batteries for breakfast.I bought this for my son as a first birthday gift and I am very happy with it.This thing works fantastically and my 1 year old and 4 year old both LOVE it~!My 12 month old daughter LOVES it!I bought this toy for my 11 month old and it has been a HUGE hit.She loves to switch out the cups, pour water from one cup to the next, trying to catch the water in her hands, and the list goes on.I am so happy with this purchase!My son (who is 1) used to cry when the bath water went off because he loved to run his fingers under it and collect water in his bucket.My only complaint is that the neck isn't as long as I prefer, I wish it was just a few inches taller.The suction cups aren't that great either so it comes off the tub wall often.Overall it's still a great toy and my son loves it.Update:  This stopped working just months after I bought it.I bought this for my 18 month old son and he loves it.Ordered two and now I have two very pleased grandchildren who play with each grocery item w/ their own unique color and texture.The perfect size not too big and not too small.A perfect gift for the upcoming holiday season and/or birthdays or .just because you LOVE them.I bought this for my granddaughter who is too young (6 months) but she does love to watch and touch and feel.I love it.I purchased this for my 14m at the time daughter for our plane ride to Houston from Seattle and was shocked at how long she played with it.Finally her first birthday rolled around and this was at the top of my list of gifts for her.After reading the reviews here I knew it was going to be a hit with our family.Yeah, I said family, not baby.My older kids love to play with the baby but often want to play more imaginative play (they're 11 and 12) than she's ready for.I like to play peekaboo with the banana's face by pulling down the peel--it has velcro on each peel part so it can be "peeled" halfway--and it makes the baby giggle.It's colorful, has excellent textures and is well crafted, has adorable little faces that you can't help but smile back at and the sound making parts are an added bonus (rattling, crinkling, squeeking, jingling...) and with the bag itself your child can learn IN and OUT.My 2o month old daughter loves these!All the pieces are really soft and all the sounds from each fruit/veggie keeps kids occupied.My 9 month old baby loves this.This wipe warmer is great.It keeps the wipes very moist and warm.The wipes come out very easily, as long as you are using pop up wipes.You may see some discoloration on the pad but not on the wipes.Our changing station is next to a window and the wipes were getting so chilled that our baby would get startled every time she was changed.It's not the end of the world, but she does seem much more comfortable now.The wipes don't stay warm for very long so you do need to be able to have the warmer right next to the changing pad.I found that it also helps to tuck the last wipe back down into the warmer so that only a tip of the corner shows.This helps keep more of the wipe warm for the next change.Warmed wipes are also great for between bath clean-ups behind babies neck and under their chin.I like that the straps haven't gone all twisty like our infant car seat, I really like the size, installation was super easy.The only drawback is that It took a bit to get it in the right angle because our seats go down a bit, and there is no solid base I had to experiment with putting things underneath it to get it right.The seat belt holders was not convient or easy to use.It was about the same size as the maxi cosi we ended up puchasing.The brown wasn't as deep as I was expecting either.I absolutely love this seat.I was able to do this easily, with my boys graco nautilus( also an amazing car seat)  on the outsides and my little pink coccoro in the center.My new little girl loves it and rarely fusses in it.My little one was 7 lbs when we first used it and she fit very comfortably and smaller babies would be fine as well, she is now 14lbs and we are getting tomthe point where I may have to remove the infant padding, because she is a little to snug.The install can be tricky but once put in correctly is very snug, and seems safe.The buckling can be a little tricky because the bottom buckle has to be put together first then snapped into the buckle.Also it does get dirty easily but washing and removing the seat coverbis fairly simple so not to big a deal.I highly recommend this seat.Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Keylimethe fact that you can also use it with  the combi flash stroller fame is great, and wonderful simble and chic carseat and snap and go stroller.Combi Coccoro Flash Stroller Frame, BeigeThe Combi Coccoro accomplishes everything and looks great, too.Tightening and releasing the seat straps are super easy.Just push the center button and pull the straps to loosen.She holds him and gums on his face :)  I like that it is colorful and not too big.My daughter is 4 months old and this is a good size for her to hold on her own.Soft, comfy AND an adorable monkey!I use them to wipe my daughters face, she is in the drooling stage.I bought this with the matching hooded towel.Great choice.Fabric is nice and comfy for baby and artwork is adorable!My son doesn't seem to like them and I believe it's because they are a little too rough.They get the job done.I bought this mug after my 1.5 year old figured out how to remove the lid from the Munchkin Snack Catcher within 5 minutes of me giving it to him.Yeah, so the kid can get more than one Cheerio out of the mug at a time but so what.I've tried baggies, tupperware and most recently those little snack cups with the wedges cut out.With the snack cups, the first day I handed it to my 13 months old, he pushed down on one of the wedges and shook all the food out!Not that spilled cheerios are so hard to pick up but as a mom, it is wonderful to know that I don't have chase him around picking up all the spilled food.The only cons I have is the size and the cost.I do think that $16 for a snack cup is too much.Maybe if these become more popular the law of supply and demand will allow for a reduction in cost.Second, it is rather large.It would be nice to have a smaller size.That being said, I absolutely recommend this to any parents of toddlers.This Munchie Mug is awesome and totally worth the (probably too high) price.My only regret is that I did not get this sooner!The cup is actually quite large; in fact, at first I thought it seemed too big, but the little slot around the top edge is a perfect handle for little hands and my daughter is SO proud to toddle around holding on to it.The only crumbs that I have seen outside of the container is whatever little bits are on her hand from reaching in, but I have not seen any crumbs fall out even when she holds her hand inside it upside down or shakes it around.Can't say how much I love this cup!It is the only cup my son can't open, and that alone makes it priceless!My only complaint is that it is a bit on the large side.While this is a bit pricey, it's worth every penny.If there is a mess, there is a small mess and it's only because my son took a huge handful out at once versus a small amount and then dropped them everywhere.Absolutely love it!!!I bought 2 of them for my son and am getting ready to buy one for my niece.Sure, it's a little expensive, but the quality of the mug is fine, and it works as advertised- and does indeed prevent spills.Here are my complaints about it:1) it's big.I'm glad I did my homework, and even happier I decided on this product.I was prompted to get a snack container when during a toddler class, my son was going around and having his way with everyone's snack containers!!I saw him steal multiple SNACK TRAPs and MUNCHIN SNACK CATCHERs... then before I knew it, Cherios, raisins, nuts, etc.Also, the top can be a bowl - I pull out a few snacks and place them onto bowl like top and my son goes and play, then comes back and grabs more.This mug also comes with a lid, by the way, that screws on in place of the other one.I gave it a five stars but the size can be a bit smaller (although it's not a huge deal, but certainly can't stuff it in your pocket) and still keep all these great features.Buy it if you don't mind not being able to stuff it in your pockets :).This cup is AWESOME!!!I have tried many of the other snack cups with the silicone/rubber flaps on top and they do an OK job of keeping my toddler's snacks in...but this cup does a much better job than just OK.I love the idea of the stretchy fabric on top vs. the other silicone flap cups because it is soft and does a wonderful job of holding in what your toddler isn't pulling out (even if they are digging in it holding it upside down).When I first got it, I did think it was a bit large...but that doesn't bother me anymore and I actually prefer it's size because it is easier to find when my little one drops it around the house.I bought these cups for my daughter when she was just starting to use cups and they dripped like crazy.They often ended up sideways or upside down and the water just ran out the lid - free flowing.If you have a child that always places their cups upright this would be a good cup but I found I was do a lot of extra cleaning.This shield has proven worth the money.The tot shield blocks the children from reaching the stove and has a nice look to it (I think).Everyone who has come over to our house and has seen the shield has commented on what a "cool" idea it is.My husband takes it off whenever he is cooking, but I don't mind it being there.You should take it off when you open the oven door so it doesn't fall on the floor, but sometimes I leave it on and it manages to stay in place.One thing I found a little amusing, though, was that the label was put on upside down on our particular shield.You'd think that would be kind of important to the manufacturers...I found this stove guard to be the perfect solution on our Whirlpool gas stove.The shield was simple to assemble and install, it does not interfere with the use of the knobs on the front of our stove, and it definitely functions as an effective barrier to our baby boy who is curious about everything.There are just 3 very minor drawbacks, none of which are significant, in my opinion:1.Wide Width: This shield is so much wider than our standard-width stove that the cabinet drawers on either side of the stove top are now difficult to open without running them into the shield.2.Falls Off with Door Open to Floor: Only when the oven door is wide open--all the way to the floor--does the shield come off.This is no big deal to us, since it is rare that we would have our oven door open to the floor.The shield will work just fine without them.You cannot put a price on safety and security.I sure wouldn't want to rest MY naked bum on it, so I can't imagine it'll be too comfortable for baby's skin.I love this changing pad cover.I've washed multiple times now and it had held up great and fits just as good as day 1.Even though I'm someone who prizes natural fibers, and even more so when they are organically grown, I am evaluating them from the perspective of having found a changing pad cover that, though synthetic (may be easier to wash clean) is so soft and sensual that it's sure to please baby -- and looks nice in the nursery as well (referring toCarters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Ecru).He enjoys it and seems comfortable in it.)-It just LOOKS cool.We've gotten so many compliments on it.I honestly can't think of much to complain about.Some people have commented on how it's like a "spaceship" because it's so complicated.(PRACTICE before you put a real baby in there!I almost dropped my nephew because I was fumbling around and trying to figure out what some of the levers did!...It is a bit costly, but we registered for it and received it as a present and it was worth it!right now we mainly use it as a stationery entertainer for when WE eat meals as she has not started solids yet.It's beautiful and so easy to manuever and goes from room to room.love it!This is so stylish and folds up so compactly!This high chair is amazing.My son loves the swing option.I love that it reclines as well.Here are some cons, in my opinion, after I received the stroller.1) parent cup holder really really sucks!.It's too small to hold a parent water bottle.Good that child can't remove it.I purchased this stroller because my Maclaren Quest did not recline all the way.I needed a stroller with added comfort when taking my son on vacation or trips to theme parks where he would have to be in his stroller for prolonged periods of time.It is perfect for adult beverages though.Unlike that Maclaren basket which is very high off the ground and never has dragging issues.Inspite of these minor flaws, its still a very good/sturdy stroller overall and does its main duty which is to give my son a safe and comfortable ride.The Light Way also folds more compactly than the Si.Great stroller!Pretty easy to figure out and seems very sturdy.I bought this stroller because my sister has the same one and its solid, and really attractive.We bought the 2010 Peg Perego Si in "Kiwi" to replace our bulky travel system Chicco Trevi stroller while we're on trips.This takes some time.-Some people have mentioned that their front wheels shake uncontrollably.Mine shake pretty noticeably, causing the whole stroller to tremble a bit when moving at any speed.It's still not capable of off-roading, but the steering is fantastic and it's so slim and lightweight compared to our "outdoor" stroller.The fabric has held up nicely, repelling water and stains very well.Now that our son can eat solids,  I do wish there was a a small snack/cupholder attachment on the front bar so that he could serve himself while we're on the go.I still wish it had a good adult cupholder too.So far, this has stopped my 13 month old from yanking the plugs out of the outlet.I'm very happy with this item.This plug cover is super easy to use for an adult but not for the little one.There is plenty of space inside for the largest adapters to fit.Works with standard and the square outlet types, one or two screws.I bought 10 of the Safety 1st plug covers from various places then when I started to install them around the house, I found that they only fit the outlets with 1 screw in the middle and I had some that had 2.I use it on the non-nursing side when I nurse my son.It is easy to use, easy to clean, and helps me keep my shirt dry while nursing (I would often leak through a nursing pad and my shirt on the non-nursing side).It is not at all uncomfortable, and does the job it is intended for very well.And it is cool to take it out of your shirt and think, "wow, look how much is there!*It is surprisingly large.*It leaks if you bend over too far.I didn't get it until my son was about 4 weeks old, and I know I leaked more before that.It is not uncomfortable for me at all.Overall I love this!But they rinse off very easily!I've actually bought these a few times because our dog loves to chew them up when she can get ahold of one.She chews on everything, and won't take a standard pacifier, but she LOVES these!My son starting teething very young and wanted to bite bite bite all the time (usually on mama!)He was far too young to keep a good grip on most traditional teething toys, but he took right to these the way he took to his other pacifiers.Finally, comfortable nights for the baby this summer!We own a A+A slumber sleepsack and it is awesome.We wash it on warm and it has held up great so far.The zipper works fine too.When I first opened the box I was suprised at how thin it is and wondered if it would hold up.I don't know how others treat their sleepsacks and if their kids walk around in them or not, but ours is still in one piece and it is in constant use.No complaints from me!***EDIT**** January 2012By now we own two of these and while they held up fine as long as our son was a quiet non-sitting or non-standing sleeper, we now have two ripped A+A sleep sacks.However after a few washes and watching my 15m old walk around in it (we got a bigger size for her then she needed) I realized it was pretty sturdy.I really like the weight of it, works great in warm weather!I even registered on Amazon for a second one and another one in the 4 layer heavier weight for winter.I have a few of these and love them, although I feel they are very fragile.In general, I love aden + anais.I have their burp cloths and swaddling blankets, and I've been very happy with both, so this sleeping bag seemed like a perfect purchase for the summer.We live in a temperate climate without air conditioning, so having a light bag for the summer was important.I thought my average twins (6 months)would fit, because we have a different walker already and they fit it just fine.My boys are of average height too.I should of listened to the reviews, but i went with my own gut.Amazon did take it back on return, and I purchased another Chicco--happily.He has so enjoyed the toys on the tray and that when the toys are "opened", he couldn't fit through the doorway, so it kept him right where I wanted him!It was GREAT!I loved the safety grippers on the bottom.It was always well balanced and solid, not to mention entertaining.This caterpillar is not only cute but it is entertaining with all of the tags sticking out of it.I tried it 3 different times, trying different positions and adjustments.I have given up on carriers and we just bought a backpack carrier for my husband instead that my little one loves!We'd loved our Bjorn but after a while our backs hurt too much.We used it all over Italy.It folds up really small and the should piece really makes it comfortable.Our daughter loved riding in it as it holds her in the same position that we hold her in when we carry her.She is now 15 months old and still fits in it great.He was a July baby, so I needed something light and gauzy.This was perfect!Its huge size accommodated him as he grew, and while he no longer needs to be swaddled, I can tell if he still had needed to be, there would be plenty of fabric to do so!I still use this blanket all the time - it's a great nursing cover.Light, unobtrusive, and breathable for baby.It's a great, versatile blanket.they had good and responsive customer service and overnighted the parts right away.so i just got it - can't tell you how muchill like it in a few months, but for now its great!im sure ill be able to get even more the better i get at it!The thing I most disliked and I had actually bought this item because of that feature, is the cell phone pocket on top.It is weirdly made and could close a little bit better.That's the reason I bought the Be Rich in the end.The outside zipper pocket is smooth to open.Not too big but perfect for change.2.I love the Lotus pattern and the stain resistant bag.3.I really don't use it much but it is a nice litte extraWHAT I DO NOT LIKE:1.Cell phone pocket in the front.I have a Droid Eris (love it!)It should have been a magnet or velcro at the very least.The extra sleeve for pictures/credit cards.Sad but true.So anyway, this very large sleeve holds 2 pictures (useless) and 6 credit cards - that is is.This is a lot of used space for not much.Two areas for lipstick is okay but I rather have one little pocket for just one instead.Trying to take out and put back a lipgloss in that stratchy loop takes skill with 2 hands and a little bit of time.Then when it is open, it is ALL THE WAY OPEN like a massive bi-fold, so you have to hold it with one hand.But the MAJOR isn't huge and you can not really place your set of keys inside on the cord.Both straps.I would much prefer the wristlet to either be a smaller loop or preferably be like a camera wristlet that you can move back and forth to tighten it on your wrist.The purse strap is to rigid.I like that they give you the option but neither feel comfortable.8.If you take out the photo/credit card sleeve, you only have one place for license and 2 other spots for credit cards.Everything has a place which at first looks great but you find you WANT a place to throw something in there every once in awhile.I give it 1.5 stars.Not worth the price AT ALL.It can also be used in vehicles that don't have an anchor for a versa tether- Easy harness adjustment no re-threading necessary- Easy to recline (this is a great feature and something my previous car seat didn't have.We've been using Britax for 13 years now and have had many of their great seats.We got this seat for my son at 4m of age.He was in his brother's hand-me-down decathlon (my fav seat) with all new foam and straps but I wanted to take advantage of the newer safety features of a new model seat.He loves this seat, rarely fusses in the car, even now at 8m, just doesn't like going in the dark.The seat installs easily and fits well.WE also just used in a small 2010 ford micro suv using latch/tether and it still fit good, just couldn't install with as much recline as I do in my full size SUV.My only complaints (and these are minor, nothing worth losing a star over;) are:1) the fabric on the infant inserts was so rough at first, cured by washing a few times.2) never heard the 'click' of the secure click feature.3) chest buckle sticks.Overall, a great seat, great price at amazon and still made in the USA!Everyone has rather thoroughly explained the pros and cons of the seat, which I LOVE LOVE LOVE.So I'll spare you ALL the details.One thing I don't see mentioned is the top tether, which straps to the floor and keeps the seat from flying upwards in case of a short-stop.Once the headrest is at the topmost position, I doubt it will fit.This helps some.-----My five month old is now 13 months old, and I'd like to say that I am still loving my car seat.Let's talk about comfort.The seat gives her the cushioning to be comfortable and cozy, but also the good support where she needs it for her little body to enjoy extended seat-time and the ventilation to not be too hot.Having our kids comfortable on a long-haul trip is invaluable in reducing the strain of a long trip on everyone in the vehicle, and I also think it is very telling of the comfort they experience on the short-haul trips as well.Yes, this seat is a giant.I really don't know - but I can tell you that whatever seat you end up choosing, a Britax is worth the cost.It's not that obvious from the photos but in person, they're there.When we opened the box, I was surprised that 1 - the box was a square (unlike the Boulevard) - AND there wasn't any items inside as a filler for the seat itself.It does take up some width of the backseat =(LATCH system - easy to install.make sure to pull the straps TIGHT after install.Seat will wobble a bit but once you tether it down (or up) it's very secure.If you do tether it up, make sure the seat is still within the 30-45 degree requirement.My car has squishy seats.Recline: If installing rear facing, MAKE SURE TO RECLINE THE SEAT before installing the LATCH system.It's very hard to reach once your seat is latched.Background Info: My son is now 16 months old.20lbs, 29" tallSEAT:Straps: REALLY SOFT!!Harness is easy to use and unclip to get our baby out.Drawback is that the rubber part of the strap is too tall (it's longer than my son's torso (I had the same complaint when he was 6 months).It irritates him and doesn't seem comfortable.There is also another pad behind the buckle so it doesn't push onto his bits and his belly.Padding: Infant inserts removes easily so as my son gets bigger, we can take the cushion off.Seems like it will work with his large head.Style: Good looking.Fabric is soft and feels nice.Color combination is attractive.It's nice that this seat has a pattern vs the Boulevard which was just a color scheme.Overall: The seat is pretty light.I carried it without a problem (Surprising b/c the box is the size of a small playhouse).It's great that the seat sits a little higher so my son can look out the window.I feel very confident and comfortable that my son is in a secured and well rated seat.Unfortunately it is also the size of a small whale, especially when in the recline position (which you have to use to keep it rear facing).When we first tried using it my daughter (then 9 or 10 months) was also just interested in picking it up and dumping it, but we put it away for a little while and brought it back out when she was more interested in the food (11 or 12 months) and since then she hasn't done it anymore.I'm not sure if there are any plates out there that can truly deter a determined 10 month old!The size is great for a younger toddler, it's perfect for finger foods, the design is cute and it cleans up easily.I especially like the separated compartments and the price is great compared to many of the alternatives.bought this hoping it would replace the placemats i brought to resturants.and once there is a tear, the rest comes off easily.We bought this changing pad for use with a newborn.As other reviewers noted it is nice and thick, and is a good size that allowed us to continue using it as he grew older.On the plus side, the raised edges provide a little extra comfort level for the parent, and also help keep anything unwanted from getting off of the pad (if you have a boy).On the negative side, as another reviewer noted, the straps can scratch the surface underneath the pad.Other than these issues, which are hard to avoid in a changing pad, it works well and seems to be very comfortable for the infant.We have only been using this pad for a few months now (bought in September 2010).Usually we put a protective towel or blanket on top as well.Seldom we use a disinfectant wipe to clean it off.BUT, we have noticed that the vinyl has already started to break down and small tears/holes are forming.Otherwise, the contoured changing pad works well for us.I got this instead and it works great.This worked fine as a changing table.When my son had a bit of reflux at 2-3 months old, we propped is up at a slight angle and used it as a co-sleeper in our bed.Works great, fits Pottery Barn Baby changing covers.The Summer Infant Changing Pad is large and comfy for baby.The raised edges are high to make sure baby stays on the pad once the wiggles kick in!A perfect cover to put on this pad is the American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Contoured Changing Table Cover.I bought one of these pads on sale to keep in our car -I hate how dirty many baby changing areas are when out and about (and sometimes they aren't available at all) so for the sale price of around $20 I thought this would be worth buying and keeping in the car (if you have a big enough vehicle to do a diaper change anyway, we can fold a seat down).I use a soft Carter's cover on it, and it's great.I have a baby who is very big for his age so I love it that this pad is nice and long.This pad is actually longer than the one currently on my baby's changing table, and really my son is getting too big for the table anyway...this pad will be more comfortable than just changing him on the floor.I recommend this pad for the price.Keeping a cover on it should at least help minimize tearing, but at least you can wipe this down nicely if and when needed.I bought this primarily for changing my baby in the car!The back trunk surface is too hard and uncomfortable for him, so I just place him on this pad and changing him is a breeze!My son wiggles and rolls when I change him, so I love that it contours and buckles him in.This changing pad was recommended by a friend and I received it before my daughter was born.It fit perfectly on our changing table.The straps work amazing and the pad is thick, supportive, and seemingly comfortable for my little one.It is contoured perfectly to fit newborns all the way up to toddlers.I wanted a nice thick changing pad and this met all of my expectations and more!This one was so perfect we actually bought a second to have one upstairs and one downstairs.The size is big which we love, even though our little one is pretty little, she is secure with the straps and contoured sides!This does great!!The size is large that we should get many years of use.**Update Nov 2011** We have been using this since our child was born and it is still in top condition!We also use it in the bathroom to lay him down after his bath - makes it easier to put his dipe back on and get him dried off.We still highly recommend this item :-)My baby finds this pad so comfortable that we call it her, "baby lazy boy recliner".The pad is long so be sure to measure your table.Instead of buying a changing table, since we already have a couple suitable dressers with nice wide flat tops, I decided to try going with a changing pad.Since it is a bit longer than many standard changing pads, I decided to just buy a few receiving blankets to use as covers, and they work wonderfully - if I get anything on one, I just use Bio-Kleen Bac-Out as a pre-wash spray and toss it in with the dirty cloth diapers.It's a great solution and now I want one that lives on top of my laundry table downstairs and in the baby's nursery (I have this one in our room on my dresser).And it seems very sturdy for the price!I really like this changing pad.It was a great buy and it the perfect size.It will be big enough to grow with my son for a while.I have not had my baby yet.....but is it really a must to have such a HUGE changing pad?It is easy to roll as well.This is a great one.It came today and is awesome!Colors are bright and the rattle inside has a pleasant sound.This is def going to be a "go to item" for any future baby showers or child gifts.His little fingers easily latched onto it, allowing him to move it around and bring it to his mouth (for chewing on, of course).He loves the jingle bell inside and is still interested in it at 7 months!We haven't really found it to be very 'bendy', but it is soft and flexible.I bought this for my son when he was starting to be able to grab onto things.The rattle ball inside keeps his attention really well and he loves the little caterpillar's face.Great, simple toy!The "Baby Einstein Bendy Ball" is sorta misnamed - it really does bend!We mainly use it while we are in the car - the Bendy Ball fits nicely in our daughter's lap..Pros-- Perfectly sized for small wandering hands.It also grabs the attention of our cat, but that is a separate story.- Brightly colored - once she gets older we will play the "Point to the red/blue/green/yellow game.- Is light enough that it doesn't hurt her when she bangs herself in the head.- We have not found in sharp edges - I know one reviewer mentioned this, but they may have receieved a bad bendy ball.- Despite all of the cut-outs and the Baby Einstein logo the ball will roll - which makes it a fun crawling toy.- Not that expensiveFinal Verdict - While I would not say that this is our daughter's favorite toy - she does enjoy playing with it and for the price it is a welcome addition to her toy box.4 1/2 starsIt is bright and colorful and holds my daughter's interest for a great length of time.She mostly just shakes it, rattling the ball around inside, but I'm sure she'll be rolling it across the floor in a few more months.The soft, flexible sides are good for mouthing and the open lattice design is nice for babies to grab hold of.It's also colorful and not too heavy for a young baby to pick up.Shape and size make it easy for my 4mo old to play with....yet it also makes it easy to get his hands caught inside.This has been my son's favorite toy since he was 3.5 months.My son has been using since 1 month old as a kick ball.We suspended with "lots of links" from rungs of play mat.The whole family loved to watch him kick.As he developed, he started wrapping his toes around the ball and pulling it this way and that.This ball is colorful and is sure to be an attention grabber.I realize we didn't pay that much for the toy, but rattles are cheaper than the price we paid and he would've probably been happier with a colorful rattle.I wrote back, asking for more detail and never received a reply.My child likes this toy very much but because everything goes in his mouth (whether it's intended for that or not), I can't let him play with it.I bought this from Babies "R" Us when my son was 4 months old and 2 1/2 months later he still plays with it everyday.The ball is easy for him to grasp and move from hand to hand.The rattle inside captures my son's attention instantly.The bendy ball is bright, soft and bendable; my son has hit himself in the head with it a few times and hasn't injured himself.This is the first toy we grab when we want to distract or calm fussiness.It is easily held and easy to grasp for little ones who are just beginning to learn this new skill.This is one of my son's favorite toys.Purchased it when he was around 3mo and he's still grabbing at it and tossing it at 6mos.Great rattle sound, bright colors, easy for little hands to grasp.I feel safe in letting our son play with this; no sharp edges or anything to choke on.She is just starting to try to grasp things, and she has a very easy time holding this ball.With every shake of my son's hand, the little bells inside made a jingling noise, and he was fascinated with it.Try holding down the arm of a 2.5 year old kid who's cranky because he's sick.2.Don't really want to use the oral tip after using the rectal tip.This fits easily and is perfect for light weight storage.We love that it is mesh since we keep our diapers and wipeys in here and can always see how much is in it and know when to re-stock.The straps grip well and protect our stroller's aluminum bars as well.I was actually impressed with the quality and how well designed and made it is at such a realistic price.It is always great to find something so useful and designed right.My only complaint is that I didn't order two in the first place.I have this cheap no frills umbrella stroller that has no pockets or anything.I purchased this net and it fits all the stuff I need (bottle, wipes, blanket, etc.)It holds a nice amount and is great for those items that you need to have on hand for quick access.I highly recommend purchasing TWO of them - one for each side of the stroller.Another plus, if you want to take it off the stroller and onto the plane, it's very easy to remove and you could wrap the velcro around a diaper bag/purse strap and off you go!Doesn't weigh down the back of a stroller, no tipping when baby gets out of the stroller!Can hold A LOT - the mesh part stretches out to hold so much more than you'd think.We can fit a few diapers, wipes, a spare outfit, toys, snacks, sippy cup/bottle, plus some of my own items in just one!I was very nervous when I checked Walmart online to order some more and they were not longer selling them - VERY relieved to see that Amazon still has them!My only con - I wish they came in more colors than just black!I think it would've taken ages to file her nails down with this.On the flip side, it is very safe since accidentally filing my baby's finger won't hurt her.This is one of those baby items I have never and will never use.I also purchased this for my sister in law who agreed that the vibrations were too strong.The file is metal, as well, so I don't see how metal can be gentle on the baby's nails.I bought this item from another store, but saw it on here when trying to find the manual online.You can take a temperature in the same spot 10 seconds apart & it will give you a completely different number every time.At 2 months my son had his shots so I took out this thermometer just in case.When we came home he was fine but I took his temperature anyway and it read normal.It showed that he had a fever.I really like how easy this is to use.I took my temperature multiple times with ease, and the results were consistent.I bought these so I could have more nets for the Nuby Nibbler.My son loves the Nuby.Our first net that came with the Nibbler got pretty dirty and had some fibers (banana or other fruit) that was just so ground in it, I hated seeing this net dirty looking all the time.I have dedicated one to just bananas and the other ones stay nice and fresh looking.Well, the idea of having my son suck on a net that has been soaked in OxyClean for 12 hours makes me cringe.I also find that if the banana is frozen when it goes in the bag, it helps more than a raw banana.The bottles work great because the nipple base is nice and wide and the nipple is very soft to touch, both things that are great for a breastfed baby.It is nice not having to clean the bottle base everytime you feed her, just pitch the liner and wash the nipple and ring.The flow on the nipple is nice and slow so they do have to actively suck and milk isnt just free flowing down their throat, again great for a breastfed baby.Since we only give 3-4 bottles a day at daycare and 1 or 2 on the weekends it isn't such an expense, so much more reasonable if you are still breastfeeding when you are at home.I warm these bottles by making sure the cap is on and leaving it in a cup of hot water for a few minutes.Works great.This is the only bottle my son liked-- tried Avent and the First Years with slow flow nipple.The avent leaks and my son HATED the slow flow nipple.Highly recommended.She is now 7 mos and I bought her this teether and she refuses to even put it in her mouth.My son has been teething since about 4 months.These cups are great.They really do not leak (unless you forget to put the little gasket back into the lid after washing it).Like one of the other reviewers, I was also sent a pink and purple cup (for a boy) but no biggie.I'm not concerned, really.This is a bit expensive compared to some of the other options, but it is absolutely fabulous.It created a nice sized space for our infant daughter to learn to crawl and move around, giving her enough room to play and move, while being contained.You can do the large square as illustrated, or a rectangular shaped half space, or a quarter space square, which made it convenient to take to my parents' house for the weekend.We call it our "Fun Corral" - it's awesome and like I say in the title, worth every penny.Best Play Pen EVER!!Great investment.I would like to get an additional one with another Extention Kit so there is a HUGE play area (we have 20 acres) space is not an issue.AWESOME ITEM!After a power outage killed my original adapter, I needed a quick replacement, and this adapter hooked right up and works perfectly.It is extremely clear, and the lights on the top of the receiver light up in bright white from left to right when our son makes noise; this is handy because it confirms the audio, so you know you're not hearing something more locally.The receiver also has a walky-talky feature on it, and often we have calmed down our now 13-month old by holding that button down and talking softly into the handset.We haven't used that feature very often, but when we have, it has been quite pleasant.This is really nice.It works perfectly.The sound is crisp and clear and it really gives me peace of mind.The other features are great too.I bought it mostly for the monitor features, but I have found that the other additions are really nice features.I have tried numerous monitors that claim no interference.This one delivers.Every feature listed works and works well.The light is enough to see by, but not enough to disturb baby.Then she calms down and waits for us to come.My favorite features are that it IS great sound quality.The other favorite feature is that the monitor can be carried on a neck chain, making it much easier to deal with than a pocket clip.Our "baby" of 19 months sometimes starts to drift off then, the music will stop and she'll wake herself and yell "sing" because she wants it to play again.I have been very pleased with the performance of this baby monitor.I wish it had video like my Summer Infant monitor, but the features it does have are terrific.The unit is small, about a four-inch cube, and the parental unit fits comfortably in my hand.Both are easy to use with intuitive buttons.You cannot initiate the lullabies from the parental unit, which is a shame, but a quick press of the lullaby button before you leave the room helps sooth the baby.The units work well through multiple levels of the house, through several walls and even outside with no interference at all.He could just talk if he needed something and we could press the button on the parental unit for him to hear us.It was a great system.Maybe it would work better for newborns.I bought this trying to coordinate with pieces from a different line of bedding.I don't want most of the pieces that come in the Cocalo Azania set, but their dust ruffle is not sold separately.I did a lot of searching and was so happy to find a cute dust ruffle sold individually that coordinates with the other items.I love this blanket!It's sooo soft and the size is just right.It is made of quality cloth and for the price, it's really worth it!I have gotten a lot of compliments on how cute this blanket is.Run, don't walk, to get these blankets for baby showers for all your friends.It's a great buy at under $15 and warm for the baby.I used this blanket for my son since he was 5 months old.He is now 3 1/2 and it has been passed down to his newborn sister.The only problem is now the seam along the edge came off a big but it can be easily fixed with some thread, but really you can not really notice.We purchased the Roundabout 50 after comparing all the items in the Britax line.I knew that our daughter would hit the height requirement before the weight requirement, so the extra 15 or so pounds the Marathon can hold would not be a worthwhile investment for us.We are incredibly happy with the Roundabout, and especially with all the different adjustments we can make.We cloth diaper our daughter, so it is great for her extra cushy butt.The clasp across the chest is a more secure fit, the strap adjustment button is so easy to push (not to mention the straps slide easily), the material is made of much better quality, and it is so much more padded.So I guess I am trying to say that the sides of the Britax come out further, keeping the head in.We prefer the Roundabout so much more that we are dropping another $160 to replace the Cosco.They also added the HUGS pads for comfort.My only complaint is that the new one does not come in the fun Cowmooflage print.I own the original version, which I purchased last year (and I reviewed it here).What I loved about the original was the compact size and super safety ratings.What I did not know at the time (chaulk it up to first time parent) is your kid can max out at 40 lbs.and may not be tall enough for a booster seat.I have 'Irish twins' so I moved my 4 month old from his Graco Snap and Go to the Roundabout (rear facing).I put my 14 month old in the Roundabout 50 forward facing - he's north of 20 pounds and more than a year.This is a little more cheaply made than their premium models, but I can't complain as I got a sweet deal on this, but I wish that the seat had a separate reclining part like a true car seat.My daughter loves the seat and the fact that it's one of the safest makes me a happy person.The baby loves the steering wheel which turns and the toot toot and music sounds of the horn.I got this set with the plate, bowl, fork and spoon when my daughter was under a year old.The images on the silverware are also like new- you'd think they'd rub off, but somehow, no.I am considering getting another set just in case ours ever does start to age and they stop making this one... but not sure if the Pooh theme will still be a hit in another 3 years!All in all, a great set, worth every penny.Can't say the same for our disposables.So far, these diapers have been easy to clean and use and are holding up well to washing just about everyday.I love the bright colors!It's just like wrapping a towel around your baby's bum.I purchased these fitted diapers to use as an overnight diaper for my son.I purchased three diapers in size small (all colored).After this pre-use washing, the diapers were already pilled inside and out!However; the diaper is very absorbent, hasn't stained, and makes a great overnight diaper combined with a hemp doubler and PUL wrap.The small size still fits my son at 13 lbs.Our family has owned quite a few of these spikey balls and they are a never ending source of fun!It is the perfect size for my 15 month old as well as my 5 & 6 year olds (I think I need to order 2 more so there isn't anymore fighting!).My only gripe about it is how spikey the tips are on it...they are getting softer the more we play with it, but when we first got it...ouchy if it bumped your face!This crib fits my needs perfectly.After searching for ages I came across this one on Amazon and loved it from the outset.The cappuccino color is beautiful and being 5.4 the height suits me very well.At first the crib looked really small but it is a perfect fit in the nursery.It was easy to assemble and I love the classic look.To top it off, a great price too.I needed two new cribs for our twin boys, and while I was interested in convertible cribs, I didn't have to have one.When I saw this crib though, I thought it was surely too good to be true since it's so inexpensive compared to other convertible cribs.Plus, it seems to be a little bit different in style than other convertibles, and I like that.They came and all of the pieces (for both cribs) were in perfect condition - no bumps or scratches in any of the pieces.They were easy to assemble, and they are very sturdy.The color is a rich, true walnut.This is a beautiful crib.It DOES ding easily because it's soft wood, but it arrived in perfect form.This is an awesome crib!It is a cinch to put together, is very sturdy, and looks great!It is elegant, yet practical.I have the crib in the cappuccino color; the color is warm and rich...very nice.We were looking for a crib that would be able to fit into our bedroom and not be too large, and this one was it.I highly recommend this beautiful crib!!I have since given the cappuccino-colored crib to my friend for her baby girl as she loved the color of that one.This was the case with my cappuccino-colored crib, however, I found it added to the overall charming, rustic look of the crib and really liked the look of it.The cherry-colored crib does not have this distressed look and instead is a smooth, rich, deep cherry color which I also love.One review questioned the sturdiness of this crib....I have found this crib to be extremely sturdy and well-built.If you remember to go with a standard size 52 x 28 crib mattress, it fits perfectly.I lost the directions a couple years ago, they can't be found online (that I could see).When you email them asking for directions, you must send them all these numbers found on the inside of the crib, which I practically had to dismantle just to get access to.It's like they don't believe that you actually own the crib and you have to prove it to them.Sure I could be more responsible, but in this day and age when 95% of the baby items I own have manuals easily available online that I can find in 30 seconds, this is pretty annoying.This is a great crib for the price.That is a nice effort on their part.It's a look we love, and we were really excited when we started pulling the pieces out of the box!Our little girl is still in her bassinet so we haven't actually used the crib yet, but so far we are extremely happy!After researching tons of crib I found my preference to be a crib that would be non dropside, convertible.I found a lot where I would have to purchase separate rails to convert or they would be dropside.I finally came across the Shelby and am very pleased with it!It came in 5 pieces and a ton of screws took my husband and brother about an hour to put together and it is very sturdy so far but light enough for me to be able to move around if I needed to.My only problem with it is finding furniture to match with it!I ended finding a walnut dresser and nightstand from Walmart that matches it fairly well.I was very suprised to see that there was no matching furniture to go with it if you pick the Dark Walnut color.Which the wood sample picture is more fairly accurate than the actual stock photo.This is a nice looking crib for very cheap.I absolutely love this crib.It was very easy to put together.Has a very nice look.It was very easy to put together (took my husband and I about 1 hour) and the crib is super sturdy.Also my 2 mo old LOVES it!Its standard height and our mattress fits perfectly snug!It is such a stunning and somewhat rustic looking crib!Great purchase!Cute and keeps our baby's head safe.And, contrary to other reviewers who have had it slip off their faucets with no shower converter-pin, ours stays on pretty well with our smooth faucet.BUT -- this isn't mold resistant from what I can tell at all.I know we have a high incidence of mold growth in our bathroom even with extra care to clean and ventilate, but I wish this product was a little more fuss-free, considering that any additional work on top of parenting is hard to manage.A trusty little item that works well with your shower/bath tub if you have the diverter (CAUTION: IF YOU DON'T HAVE A SHOWER DIVERTER THEN THIS MAY NOT WORK!).We do have the diverter so this works quite well.Well worth it!It looks cute in our bathroom without adding a cluttered feeling, and it protects my daughter's head from getting bonked on the sharp faucet.It's ingenious how the fins adjust the tightness.If your faucet does not have a diverter, this isn't the model for you.Highly recommended!This one, by letting the shower spoke through it, allows you to use the tub as a shower, as well as protect the baby.Also remarkably easy to put on and take off - I'm very happy (and amazon has a better price than the other places we've seen it).However the blue in the photo looks almost like a baby blue.I am so grateful we bought this faucet cover.We bought it based off of the reviews and it was totally worth it.This thing is perfect.Easy to install, durable, easy to clean, matches most decor since it's a solid color, cute to the kids who use the tub, etc.This little whale is adorable.It's a nice alternative to the duck ones that are so popular and the whale is BPA and PVC free, can't beat that!So, the big tub he goes.Wish I had found this for my older child - we had another one that wasn't nearly as easy to access the drain lever.Stylish and functional!Got this for my 15 month old son to protect his head when he gets close to the tub spout.It does work and easy to install.It does come off though when you pull on it without the shower tab on top.Pumping (and nursing) is and always has been painful for me.I used the 24mm with my first son, but got the "large" (27mm) of the personal fit or whatever they're called after my second son was born.I wish they made them in larger sizes.That's pretty cool.Oh, and not being able to microwave sterilize them kind of sucks.The others I give 1 star to and this item would get 3 1/2 stars.First of all, the backing part is soft.There is a circle in the plastic inside which is part of the manufacturing that sometimes rubs on the nipple - when you nips are sensitive you really don't need extra plastic in there.2.I bought them to keep my nipples aired out but in reality it does still keep them fairly moist and yeast - thrush culprit- thrives in moist environment so I eventually stopped using them.Verdict: Good for the beginning of breast feeding - invaluable really.Overall the best item compared to other brands that make shells.I realized the top/opening is just a little bit off from the standardized size that Evenflow/Dr Browns3.5oz/Medela bottles are.Also, the vent system is also just a tiny titch longer than the 3.5 oz Dr Browns vent system, so you can't mix & match.I prefer the 3.5 oz ones for the standardized opening.I bought all of them less than a month ago.Just imaging how unsettling if this happened while your baby was holding their own bottle.They are GREAT.The Glass bottles aren't so great but the company is!The venting system is great!They are very easy to keep clean and I am very happy with this purchase.My 9 month old just started pulling up to stand and the first thing he did is chomp down on his crib rail.I hopped on Amazon the same day and read the reviews on crib rail protectors.It fits perfect, attaches easily and actually looks fine on the crib.My baby is teething and unfortunaley has already started on her crib.I bought these AFTER my son began gnawing on his crib.I wish someone had told me before he added his bite marks to his beautiful crib that such a thing existed.These are great, have waterproof backing and are easy to tie on and remove.I bought the front rail as well as the side rails and they do a great job protecting the crib.They are a creamy white color, so blend in nicely with our nusery.Despite their white color, they are easy to wipe clean with a facecloth.My son was chewing on this when he was teething and got blood from his gums on it and it wiped right off.Woke up to find my son was standing chewing on the crib rail and had taken a nice chunk out of it!I was horrified and ran to see what kind of guards there are online for this not to happen again.They are exactly the right length and size for my son's crib.These are a lifesaver for my son and what's left of the crib!And there's a nice waterproof lining underneath.Strings are the perfect length and hold very good.I attached them so the strings face away from my son just in case.It is also very taut, so I don't worry my son will somehow get his head stuck underneath it.This was a concern I had when ordering them.Very happy I bought them!I was more concerned about protecting my son's rather expensive crib rather than having a perfect crib guard, so I didn't bother sending it back.These worked perfectly to prevent a certain baby boy from chewing on his crib railings that will turn into his full sized bed someday.I bought both the side and long rail covers -Trend-Lab Crib Wrap Rail Guard for Long Rail, Brown Fleeceand they worked perfectly (even on a crib that has an extra wide railing).We LOVE this rail guard.I would highly recommend this along with the short rail guards also by Trend Lab!We have a wide rail convertible crib and was looking for a rail guard that wouldn't take off the finish since we plan on converting this to a double bed in the future.We ordered the long rail guard and also the side rail guards in brown fleece.They are soft and protect the crib from my sons teeth marks.We are very happy with this purchase and plan on buying them in a different color for my daughters crib when she is able to stand up in the crib (since that is when my son started to chew on his crib).I wish I would have purchaed this crib wrap BEFORE my son started chewing on his crib.It is awesome.The material is very soft and easy to put on and take off for weekly washes.It looks nice and fits my son's DaVinci Kalani crib beautifully.The rail guard is a well made piece - it protects the wood from a teething baby and looks good doing it.The fitment was perfect for our crib.The attachment is simple - just tie down the straps around the crib slats.Love the ties.The velcro style rubs the finish from the slats.The back side of this pad is the waterproof lining.I love these crib rail covers.They are super soft, wash easily, and are simple to install.As soon as I put them on, my son stopped chewing on the crib.Order it early--it fits perfectly, it's soft and fleecy, the waterproof backing ensures no drool goes through, and the particular color we ordered (cream/off white) looks great with most bedding.Love it!Good quality and thickness.Does stop baby from chewing though.My boy is very active and he loves biting any hard things, and so he managed to leave his teeth marks on the crib sides.And I am very happy with them , My boy doesn't eat any of the paint or small wood pieces any more from his crib and the crib looks nicer after the teeth marks were covered by the crib guard.These diapers are great quality, absorbent and functional, but very big!They worked wonderfully for my newborn.(Just a note:  cloth diapers normally get soaked.You will wash every 1.5 to 2 days.We bought three sets of these utensils online (although they are available at Target in-store.)We received one of each color (pink, blue, and yellow), which is fine with me.I had been searching for a fork that would actually stab into food, as opposed to just mashing it up.These forks are great.My two-year-old son can pick up hot dogs, grapes (yes, he eats grapes with a fork), and even apple slices.The knife is not sharp, of course, but he still likes to "cut" his food with it.The spoons are just a little too wide, but they hold the food well and are easy to use.I might have to go pick up some more sets!These encourage her to grab them correctly.They are big enough that she can get food on them easily.She absolutely loves having a fork now, and the knife is a big hit, too.She asks for the knife if I don't give it to her!It's just a fork.I'm not going to spend twice the price just to get a certain color.Love these!Only complaint is that you can't pick what color you want...I've used this set with two kids and it has held up perfectly through hundreds of trips through the dishwasher.Love the forks but, hate that you cannot select a color.Why not just sell gender nutural colors if you are not going to allow the customer to select a color.I figured the odds were in our favor of getting yellow or blue - we only had a 33% chance of getting pink (I have a boy) - well we got pink.BTW - these are the best toddler forks out there and the quality for the price is outstanding.They are easy to hold and pierce toddler food easily.No blade, not sharp, but strong enough to hold up to my 4 year old who is determined to try and cut everything.Doesn't bend!They are big enough for my 4 year old, small enough for my 18 month old and when I borrowed one to take a bite, it was even pleasant for me!The only possible negative I can think of is the color, I have two girls, so I was golden, but if you had an issue with pink, you might not care for the varying colors bit.Yes, it is a pain in the behind for me everytime I have to open the cabinet, because it's definitely not a one-hand operation, but it is worth the extra effort for the safety it provides.I rarely use it because it doesn't seem comfortable against baby's skin.Very happy with it.I bought this item when my son was 4 months old and even now (at 9 months) he enjoys this on his crib.I would recommend this item after 4 months of age as the mobile was more entertaining to him before he was more mobile.This is an amazing alternative to a mobile.I know it doesn't claim to, so I didn't take points off for that, but my daughters Fisher Price Dreamland Soother did, and she really loved that feature of it.I can't believe none of Fisher Price's current soothers have that feature.My son loves to push himself up to look at the animals and touch them.Great utensils.)Very fragile that way.Otherwise great.My son (5 months) old and just started eating baby food.The spoon is my son's favorite spoon.He uses everyday and we've had this set for 9 months.BUT, I would be extra careful with the fork.You can't sterilize, microwave or put these utensils in dishwasher.But it's not a big deal to wash them by hand when you know that your child is not influenced by harmful chemicals.Plus the item isn't actually plastic and that's what I love the most about them!I think these are perfect for beginners to eat on their own.We've used this just about everyday for over 9 months.I love it.It wipes clean really easy and that's a small task when in return your kids are NOT eating chemicals=) Totally worth it!!My son (5 months) old and just started eating baby food.I feel good knowing that I am not putting his food in a container that could leach harch chemicals into it with this bowl.This item looks much bigger in the picture.The actual size is 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 2 inches high.This size is perfect for my 6-month.It's bpa, pvc and phtalate free.You can't put it in microwave, dishwasher or sterilize, have to wash it by hand.I wish they had a cup to go with it.Great eco-friendly stuff!nice little bowl.I didn't know what to expect on the size of this item but I think it is perfect for babies.It is solid and well made.They leak and got my bra/shirt wet on numerous occasions.They wash very well and hold their shape after I don't know how many washes now.No complaints here.These are the most comfortable.This duck floats well.Water will not get into the duck, so there is no worry about water getting in and forming residue/mold.We used the harness on a recent trip to Disney World.My almost two year old loves to run around everywhere, and this harness was a life saver!It also is easy to put on and take off.My daugther was able to give herself the bottle and it taught her how to control it.I keep loosing this brush since my baby likes to play with it during bath time.The clear color make it hard to find in the white tub.I got this because I wanted to protect my baby's toothbrush from germs in the bathroom.The case is very protective and I am confident minimal contaminants from flushing are getting to the toothbrush.looks darling, washes up well, goes great with the matching mobile.the colors are so versatile and allow you to match it up with many other things in the nursery.wish they made it in big girls bedding so it could grow with us - that's how much we all love it.I bought this pad to use it with the DaVinci Emily II Changing Table and it fits perfectly.My baby boy seems to agree that it is very comfortable as he normally stays very quiet on it.It is pretty well constructed, as you can expect when purchasing from a Brand like Simmons who are experts in the Mattress business.So far it has lived to expectations and I use it many, many times a day.Highly recommended.My cats destroyed the changing pad that came with my 27 year old changing table--thought it made a great scratching post!So when my son and daughter-in-law came to visit with a newborn, I had to buy a new changing pad."This is a wonderful pad.It has a non-skid bottom which is nice for a squirming newborn.It is also much thicker than the original pad that came with the table some 27 years ago.The straps are a nice addition too for the rare times you might have to strap the baby in.They are placed in such a way that a cover fits on the pad with no problem.I highly recommend it and if like me you have held on to your child's changing table for some 27 years, it would make a great replacement for the original padding.Perfect size to fit on my dresser/changing table combo.It is perfect.I have had it for less than a month and so far I am happy with it.Great quality changing pad.I also feel like the contour serves as an additional safety feature to keep your child from rolling off the changing pad.I had first ordered the LA Baby changing pad.I love the simmons contour pad.We are using it on top of one of those combo units.Ours fits great.Still have room for the diaper organizer and wipe warmer.It has a non-skid bottom and it really helps hold it in place.Great thing too is that Boppy changing pad covers fit it perfect.I really loved how soft they were and how they had the washable piece that lays on top.But I love the set up now for changing my baby.For the price - this is great.I actually never used it as a changing pad.My newborn would often end up in my King Size bed and my husband and I were sooo scared of sleeping with him there.He could not roll off of it and we didn't have to worry about rolling on to him.It fit perfectly between us on a King Size bed.She has the ones from playskool and likes those the best.I did not find the nubs too hard but then again my husband and I are not throwing them around like some rambunctious tots might.These balls are really fun and come in different colors as well as nub size/shape.I think they will work well for up to at least age 4.Bright colors, easy to hold.Easy to put together.I am very happy with my purchase.My husband's main complaint was that the wooden dowels didn't appear to do anything but help align the pieces.While the crib seems very sturdy, he wishes it had more screws to hold it together.It also looks very nice when put together.I hope it lasts for years to come.We are SO happy with our decision.The mattress fits very snug which is great and the craftsmanship is wonderful!All parts fit perfectly together.It is really beautiful, the color, the style, everything about it.It was love at first sight.It is very sturdy and all of the pieces came in perfect condition.It has now been 4 months since purchase and we are still in love with this crib.This was the cheapest one where the mattress fit snugly and it seemed very sturdy.)(4) I found it for $125 new, which made it a lot cheaper than my other top choices for cribs.I can always put pillows or blankets down for the first while.I thought this was much more economic, because if I do use it that way I can just buy a cheap bed frame and cover it with a dust ruffle.I don't even think they need headboards, but it's sure a nice option!When we received the crib, my husband and I put it together.So... not having the packaging for the crib anymore, I ended up buying a firm mattress without a steel frame instead.This is a very soft and pretty towel, but it tore along the seam after only 2 washes.I love these towels.They are not only great looking when you buy them, but also look and feel just as great wash after wash.These don't move quite as well as the Fish Mobile from the same company, but both are fun.i bought this for my 4 month old because she loved to lay on my chest and bounce by pushing against my legs which wasn't very comfy for me.The item came extremely fast which was a shock because I live in japan at a military base and everything normally takes over 2 weeks.She LOVES it.it took her no time to figure out how to roll the spinner and play with the other items.I would suggest though buying the switch a roo tea pot at least because this saucer comes with nothing that makes noises or lights up which my daughter loved so we just got the tea pot (which does both) and she has a little of everything she likes now.its great for when i have to vaccum or have to do something and cant watch her on the floor with the dogs as closely.I bought this because I wanted a fun learning center for my little girl.I am also a HUGE tea fan and thought how fun.However, my daughter loves being in this and it keeps her attention.I bought this for my 6 month old to have at grandma's house.So if you have that item make sure you call evenflo and get a replacement.This exersaucer is fine for the 1 or 2 visits a month that we take grandma's house and it was only $40.00 when we purchased it with free shipping.We bought for christmas for our daughter only to find out the cake was recalled on it.The candle light is a choking hazard.No leaks.I use the different colors to coordinate for my two kids.Out of desperation I tried these cups based on reviews and I am thrilled with them so far.If the smallest part were closer to the top, maybe it wouldn't do that.-I wish there was an insulated version!I have come to learn that there is just no perfect sippy cup.But, this is the sippy cup I prefer to grab if I'm going to be keeping her drink in my purse, since I KNOW it will not leak!I bought this for my daughter when she was about one year old and it's one of her favorite bath toys!I like that it's nontoxic but it's also really fun for her.We just purchased another pack of these as a present for a 2 year old.This is a great alternative to rubber duckies.I love these plates.Wish i could pick which color I want, but its ok since they are such good plates (i see them lasting and being able to use them for the next baby).I know I took a chance but it would be nice if I didn't have to.Also, Amazon has a warning for choking due to small parts.Not sure what child could fit a full plate down their throat.I love the design, the dividers (and the plate itself) are just the right size, and overall it's a cute plate......however........They don't stack!!!That's my only complaint, other than that, they get the job done:)Our baby boy was always spitting out his paci on accident, or as a game.I am thinking about getting another just to have a spare on hand because he is gonna love this one to bits.I had the giraffe on my registry and received it as a gift...I'm so glad I did because my son loves these Wubbanubs.But my son loves hugging the giraffe and the bear and it definitely makes my life a tiny bit easier because these do not fall to the ground every time it falls out of his mouth.They're adorable too.I only wish there was a way to throw the plush part into the washer and dryer.That's why I had to order the bear so he'd have a spare.(I just wish my son took a paci for more than a few weeks!)GREAT shower gift!!Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.This one is great for little girls and boys, so I like to give them away as gifts.I guess if I had a complaint, I'd ask to have more "beans" or filling in them to make them a tab bit heavier.I love these wubbanub pacifier holders for my twins.The best part is that they come with Soothie pacifiers, which are perfect for a newborn's small mouth.I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.For the most part, I wash them by hand.When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.I have used this a couple times when making my own baby food and I love it.It's really easy to freeze food in.When the baby food is frozen you just run hot water on the back and pop out the food.It washes up nicely in the dishwasher.I think the ammount of food that it holds is good too.if you freez baby food this is for you!!!very easy to get it out!!!!Gets the job done.I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite.It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food.(I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid.Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid.These work well for pretty much freezing only.This is a wonderful stroller.It's very compact when folded and the mesh pouch on the back is perfect for quick on the go take-a-long items.The only down side is that it's not ideal for anyone over 5'8" or so.Its great.Easy to put up, very cute pattern and I just love all the features (reclines, has sun shade, has a cup holder etc)And I can't find a scratch on it.It's very durable.Sound:This toy is much quieter than many other child toys we have.It still works great and after being not played with for many months, it's become a new/old favorite for my son to play pretend.I expect it will last through both our kids.It seems sturdy and fun!Take into consideration a 18lb baby plus an almost 20lb stroller and we're talking very heavy here if you have to struggle up and down the stairs with both of them.The adjustable straps and 5 point harness made me feel better that my baby was both safe and comfortable.Both my husband and I are not what you considered short people.My husband being 6'5" and me being 5'11" so having a stroller where we didn't have to hunch over was also a plus for us.We also loved the fact that the braking system only needed for us to touch down on one of the tires for the entire stroller to be locked unlike the McLaren which needed both to be depressed.The amenities are also a welcome addition.The two cup holders are perfect since it can hold something for me and something for baby and the basket although not too roomy is easily accessed even when baby is sleeping.First let me say that I LOVE the Britax carseats.Have four kids and have owned a Britax carseat in every shape and size.Whooo Hooo....well not so fast.It does look nice.I like my Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller in Black/Scarlet better.I was also not happy with not being able to take the fabric off to wash this thing if necessary.The pattern is classic and suitable for a boy and a girl.For a mid-priced stroller my wife felt as though this one had many of the higher end features such as the double cup holder and large under seat storage.. We currently have a jogging stroller with shocks that provides a very smooth easy to navigate ride.The chaperone has a much different and not as smooth feel when you push it.I agree with the other reviewers in that it could use a little more padding in the comfort department.It easily clicks open, and does so safely, and closes with equal ease.2.It's sturdy, durable and easy to steer.3.The sheer behemoth size of this monster makes a perfect sleeper stroller even for a five year old, which I've had a few in who slept soundly.4.This is rugged enough to stand up to everyday use, but I'm glad I no longer have to.5.)Very pleased with this purchase.This playmat is awesome.We got it as a gift for out little boy and he loves it!It makes for a great place to put them to kick and play.I do think it's a bit pricey for what you get but it's a nice splurge if you can afford to ... otherwise put it on your baby registry!We used it to distract her when they drew blood from her arm for her 1 yr checkup.I love this brand and really like this item.He's too young to actually play with it yet, but he will gaze at it for quite some time.This is a decent bouncer, I can't really complain.I've been using it with my new baby for 2 1/2 months now, and it seems very comfortable for him.My only real complaint is the choice of music, it's cute but soooo repetetive that we hardly ever want to play it.We will turn on other music for baby instead.The vibrations are good though, didn't use that so much at the start but now have found it's very comforting for baby, and he'll take a nice nap in the bouncer if you leave the vibrations going (shuts off automatically at about 15 minutes though).This bouncer is adorable!It's sweet and calming to look at.Came with assembly directions and was simple to put together, took less than 5 min.Some things I love about the Zanzibar that I haven't seen on a bouncer before:> 2 seat positions, reclined as shown in the picture or more upright> the toys detach by a velcro loop allowing you to interchange with other little toys of your own> vibration has slower and faster levels (music also has volume levels)> the frame has good bounce to it, my girl is 5wks and her little movements can bounce the seatI didn't give it 5 stars because of where the buttons are positioned.When my baby gets bigger, she will be able to kick the buttons on and off, which may or may not become upsetting to her.The buttons really should be at an angle that is out the way.But I am soo vey happy with this seat, and so is baby!I love how this laundry hamper has an inner mesh bag that you can easily remove so that you can empty the contents into the washing machine - no chance of losing tiny socks or onesies on the way to the washer...I'd say it helped to keep it in 30% more than without.It also is great for her to snuggle and suck to soothe!Definitely helps that soothies are one of her favorites too.Great!Comforting in more ways than 1!My daughter loves her Wubby!Anyways I bought one to have on hand before she was born.also thought they would be great for her to hold onto when she gets a little older.Specifically I think the cat one has the softest material.This one by far is the softest one but they are all super adorable and worth the money.I wish you could get these with other brands of pacifiers attached (ie Nuk or Mam)I bought this wubbanub as we have cats in our household.For now my baby does not care much whether the stuffed animal is a cat or a frog.However, my little boy is not very much into the soothie pacifiers and only wished for these to work with other pacifiers.I'm not sure who loves this Wubby the best...me or my baby daughter.The weight of the kitty cat helps keep the pacifier from falling out, which allows me some interruption-free sleep at night.Now that she is a little older (almost 4 months), she likes to play with it, and strokes her hands over it while she is sucking the pacifier.My baby tugs and pulls at the legs, and the stitching is holding up perfectly.I'm not sure exactly how the Soothie pacifier is attached, but it is still attached after about 3 months of use.She wouldn't take a pacifier before and was starting to suck on her fingers a lot... this has been GREAT.She loves it!The Petite Consumer's review:The Wubbanub is a super cute Soothie silicone pacifier that is attached permanently to  a special weighted stuffed animal in a variety of styles.A great shower gift too.My son has loved his Soothies since the day he was born but always had trouble keeping them in his mouth; dropping them and such.Soon after I ordered this Wubbanub (my son's first nick name was 'Monkey') at 3 months and even at 6 months old, he LOVES it and uses it as 'security blanket', if you will.He plays with it and it's very easy for him to hold on to and put in his mouth on his own.He also gets TONS of compliments on it!I definitely suggest this product to all mamas!EDIT: My son is now nearly 2 years old.We weened him off this pacifier (THE ONLY ONE HE WOULD USE) at about 12 months by cutting the Soothie out of the Monkey mouth and sewing the mouth shut.My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the monkey being the first one we got for him.He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part.That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up.I highly recommend Wubbanubs!But I still love it!They are cute, easy for babies to hold, and wash well in the dishwasher.Living in Texas, I was really happy to find the long horn here on Amazon."Regardless my daughter started banging happily on it and really liked the lights.She found out pretty quickly that she could wedge the piano on the mattress and use it as a stepping stool.Now the key board bends under her weight but it does give her a bit of a boost.Much as I'd love to leave it in because she likes it, anything that can be climbed on needs to be taken out of the crib so out it went.My son got this as a gift because he loves to kick so much.My son loves this keyboard!So funny!We have had this piano for over a month now.I sometimes wonder if they know they are creating the music though.Your baby make enjoy it but my two aren't that into it.My baby girl LOVES to kick the piano and just get a big kick out of the music and lights.I bought this thinking my daughter would love it since she LOVES to kick everything in her crib.Our newborn (3 months old at the time) loves this, and so does our 2 year old!Locally these gymnasium things cost a rediculous amount of money, so as usual, I turned to amazon to find a great deal and free shipping to boot.I bought this for my son's overnights at my mother's house.It can play up to an hour and I believe the minimum time is 15 minutes.I am going to return it and pick up the homedics projector which they sell at walmart for less than it cost on amazon.We got this as a shower gift.I, too, thought the image would rotate, but it doesn't.However, my son doesn't care.He'll gaze up at the picture and smile.Now that he's in his crib, we still use it when he wakes up in the middle of the night.It also has an "ocean" white noise sound.The light display provides just enough light in his room for me to see my way out, but not so much as to keep him awake.The projector does not display a moving scene, its completly static.One simply has more colors, but once a baby is seeing colors I don't think we need to hold off to introduce them to them.Overall I am happy with my purchase.The baby loves the ocean sound and the melody.The music and colors of the mobile are nice but it doesn't swing at all.:(I still like it but it stopped swaying today, gues I have to fix the strap again.PS.It is easily pressed while in the bag, and recorded over.It has lots of pockets and room.But other than that it will do what it was intended for.It also has a great look, so both mother and father feel comfortable carrying it.The quality is average.The portable changing pad that came with it is really too small to be of much use, so you'd probably still need to buy a separate one.I was a 38D before pregnancy and according to the box I should have gotten the S/M combo, but this fits me fine.Back panel is easy to adjust.I bought this for my wife because we have a newborn and a 10 1/2 month old.It's very comfortable.My mother-inlaw and I got a good chuckle looking at it.But we both realize this is a very important device to have.I thought it might be just another item that's a good idea but not necessary in practice...Surprisingly I find it's made the task of pumping just a little bit less daunting.I really wish I had gotten this sooner.I bought this when I went back to work- it is great!It is very adjustable to fit your body size and it washes well in the washing machine.This is fabulous!The fabric is soft and I even bought another one as a backup.Highly recommend!I have a fuller bust and purchased the size that the chart said I needed.IT is accurate!It also came very fast to APO!Comfortable, very easy to adjust the sizing via velcro and zippers and holds the flanges perfectly.Only complaint is that it only comes in pink (ugh), but who cares, when other than that it's absolutely perfect!!!If you are at home alone and pumping, you can easily attend to your babies needs.This is absolutely perfect!The sizing is great (I was a 36C before, somewhere around a DD or E now, and ordered the L/XL size).The velcro pieces are wonderful, the sizing is remarkably flexible and well thought out.So, if I wanted to leave it on for a minute to do something and throw a shirt over it, it always felt like nails down a chalk board with the t-shirt rubbing against your nipples as it moved around.this one is adjustable, which is great because finding a size that works while you're pumping can be difficult.Very nicely adjustable, I do not use the extra piece in front, and I wear this very snug.Highly recommended!My only complaint is that I would make it more adjustable.It's very comfortable and worth the money.Allows you to use both hands while pumping to eat, read, brush your teeth, whatever (assuming you can take your pump where you need to do these things).Its really comfortable & leaves my hands free to use the computer, change the channel on tv, put my hair back when it gets in my face (can't do that when you're holding the bottles!It is so soft and comfortable.It is easy to adjust.It really helps me save time so I can spend more time with my family.Also, the construction is sturdy, it's an attractive pink color, and the velcro mechanism for making it tighter and looser is quite ingenious.This is so comfortable & a must have for any pumping momma.Make sure your shirt is tucked back/up and out of the way and make sure your nursing bra cups are folded all the way down and you are gtg.I love the infinite adjustment!I have been pumping for 7 months and cannot believe I did not buy this sooner.Include a nursing shawl and this is very discrete and you can continue to get your work done.It's great item, definitely a must for pumping mom.I recently had my 2nd child and this has been a dream!!It's simple to take off and put on.To be honest, I was nervous this couln't possibly work as good as expected but it EXCEEDED my expectations in everyway.I highly recommend it.Actually I sent this link to a friend who already bought it.It is adjustable so one size does fit all.The fit is great and its comfortable too.My only complaint is that the design is a little bulky.If they could combine a SPANX product style with this, it would be absolutely perfect.I use the Playtex Double Embrace pump and had trouble using most other hands-free pumping bras because of the size of their comfort breast shields.It works well with my breast shields, the fabric is very very soft, the zipper is a very heavy-duty nylon/plastic style zipper that holds up well to a lot of use, it's very comfortable since I can adjust it quite a bit...I think the description says up to 10 inches, and the best part is that I can just hike up my shirt and wrap this around me without needing to completely take off my shirt.It makes pumping so easy, you almost (almost!)I love it and wish I had bought it the first time around-- it would have made my life much easier.I love it!It stays in place, holds the shields where they need to stay and firmly, and is super easy to get on and off.It really is perfect!This fan is safe and it works.My two year old loves it.Also, it does a good job of providing some air.Works well, durable, easy to use, soft blades don't hurt a bit if touched, etc.While the idea is good and the fan clip is large enough to use this fan in multiple places, I'm unhappy with this purchase.- The LED light display on the fan is excessive.I removed the batteries that power the LED display.- It's a battery hog, perhaps because the fan assembly is heavier because of the extra circuitry and lights added for the aforementioned LED light display.Bent blades don't move air as well and defeat the purpose of having a fan to begin with.- The "neck" isn't as flexible or as long as it needs to be, and it is difficult to position it in such a way that the fan blades don't hit the neck, especially after the blades become deformed and bent.I've found other clip-on fans for 1/2 the price at a local store with higher quality fan blades and a longer neck.The fan itself is cute and entertains my child.The clip also seems sturdy.Purchased this fan before we traveled to southeast Asia.Kept him cool and the light show kept him entertained.Would highly recommend.It's a generous size and looks really nice.Nice crib, sturdy and very nice looking.I got these before I did more research on cloth diapers.(By the way, my prefolds and Thirsties/Bummis wraps work GREAT.I just wanted a few AIO or Pocket diapers so my husband or babysitters will have an easier time if I'm not home.These wetbags are awesome.These are great for use with cloth diapering.These bags are small, but I've found multiple uses for them.These are great!I read the reviews so was not surprised by the size.I am very pleased with this purchase.When I had a newborn I could fit four small prefolds into one bag, but now my son is 10 months and the bag can really only hold one...maybe two diapers and close properly.Hi there,I loved the smallish size of these wetbags and the colorful design.I think they would be fine for occasional use or to keep in the diaper bag, but if you are planning on using them everyday, I would think twice.I love them.I have no complaints.They are not tiny mind you but if I was just looking at the bag and did not have a description I would name them a medium for sure.He's 5 months old now, and still really loves it.I would give another one of these as a shower gift me and my baby love it so much.It turns, but the two cross pieces don't spin obviously, they wobble back and forth in a weird spastic way.So, as cute as it is, I don't use that part of it often unless my son turns it on.These are gorgeous -- very well made.My baby is just 4 months old and isn't too interested in them yet (she's just learning to grab and her little mouth doesn't quite fit around the teether)...but I bet she'll really love them in a couple months.And I'm not easily pleased.Put this together myself, very easy.It is a basic changing table so it is pretty self explanatory.I am very happy with it and look forward to using it when my baby comes.box within a few days of placing the order.Assembly was super easy.The colors were exactly what I expected, a perfect match with the espresso and mahogany furniture I had already purchased.It is not as plush as the more expensive gliders but will be comfortable and is a great deal for the price.I am 5'10 and my husband is 6'5 and we have found the chair height to be comfortable.I may have to get a second one.I would have loved to give this 5 stars, but I've knocked off a bit (1/2 star or so) for the quality of the fabric.And it's nice having items delivered right to the door!It arrived very quickly, in solid packaging and the the chair and ottoman is beautiful!!Very very comfortable and glides so smooth!Highly recommend!It arrived in a few days and was easy to put together.It is so unbelievably quiet!I am very happy with my purchase!Excellent value glider annd I am happy with this purchase.The glider looks high quality, the cream color is realy nice.It was shipped very fast.This arrived pretty quickly, no complaints on delivery time.My husband got it put together in about 30 minutes, no complaints on assembly.My only complaint is I don't find the chair very comfortable.It will work fine if you don't mind this.I read about that problem on another review of this, but since so many people rated it with 4&5 stars I went ahead and purchased it.The hardware (nuts & bolts) fall off with rocking.We bought this glider when our daughter was 3 months old.I wish I had bought it sooner.The crib has a beautiful finish, with nice thick pieces of wood, and was easy to assemble.My only suggestion is that the manufacturer should include a couple of extra pieces of each size of nuts and bolts in case something happens to the supplied pieces.The cup and the  flatter surface on the bottom are nice for holding items that can't be hung on the pegs.Both the pegs and the base rotate making it easily accessible from all angles.Easy to assemble and break apart for dishwasher cleaning.This rack is great!Its durable, stylish looking, and diswasher safe!It hold so many bottles and caps and looks great on our kitchen counter.The price is great & it holds just about everything!I would definitely purchase this as a gift for a friend or family member.It doesn't take up much space on the counter and its perfect for organizing & drying bottles & things.I love this rack!It's also easy to clean/rinse off.I highly recommend this one.It seems sturdy and I like that it spins.I like that it spins easily and doesn't take up much space.Another feature that I get a lot of use out of is the cup in the middle.I use the Phillips Avent bottle brush, so it isn't like a normal one and I don't know if it would work as well with a normal one, but I think it would.This is a funky, bright drying rack that seems to work with any bottles and nipples.It doesn't remotely match anything in my kitchen, which is part of its charm, and is highly effective at what it does.Highly recommended.I like the compact and colorful design, especially the cup for spoons and such in the middle.AWesome drying rack!It looks great and doesn't look like an ugly eyesore on my counter.This item is just perfect... no mess,no leaks, and perfect size.Its perfect design allows you to put many items, but it doesn't take a lot of space in your kitchen.I've been using this for 3 months and I just love it!It makes drying the bottles and all the little pieces so organized and easily accessible.I love it.Great design!Looks fun, too.The poles are sturdy enough for glass bottles and the bottom part can be used to dry smaller pieces without losing them.i as skeptic about that it works with glass bottles when i read the review, i bought one to try, and it worked great!This definitely does the job.This bottle holder is great - it really keeps the bottles cool for a good 4 hours.As any new mother can tell you, when you walk into the house at the end of a long day of work, the baby is often crying and hungry.This bag has really reduced the stress associated with pumping and transporting milk every day.The front mesh pocket is pretty useless.The small middle pocket doesn't get very cool, so if you want your teether to stay cold it's not a good place like their picture shows.You can fit 3 standard bottles or 2 Tommee Tippee bottles in the main pocket.There are 2 ice packs.One goes on the backside of the main pocket and the other on the front side of the main pocket.Since nothing but bottles have gone in there, I know nothing sharp cut it.I was not to happy to have who-knows-what chemicals in that gel near my baby's bottles.Pros:- 2 removable ice packs- Fits 3 standard or 2 Tommee Tippee bottles- Keeps bottles in large main pocket cool for hoursCons:- Mesh pocket and small middle pocket useless- Thin plastic over ice packs so they can break easilyIf I knew what I know now when I purchased it, I would have bought something else.When I finally got it open, imagine my delight that it didn't work AT ALL!No lights!Trying this now, but the light rattling is a little distracting/irritating when the car is quiet.I like how you can adjust the position fairly easily.nice and big.However, I was pleased to find that there is no way this thing is coming off in an accident if its installed correctly...which is very easy to do.I bought it for our trip overseas, don't know what i would have done without it!!Definitely the best option for travel!I bought this couch for my 1 year old because I remember having a fold out chair when I was younger and how much I liked it because it was my size.Shipping was much faster than expected which was AWESOME!!I absolutely love the couch and so does my baby.She likes to climb on it when it is folded up or laying out.She takes her blanket over to it and lays down.It definitely was not overwhelming and I didn't have to air it out.My baby was playing on it about 20 minutes after I unpacked it (because she was napping).The foam is very firm and seems like it would not be very comfortable, but after sitting/laying on it for a few seconds it softens...maybe because your body heat molds it...I'm not sure.I do know that I love this couch and so does my daughter.Update:I've had this couch for more than a year and it is still holding up pretty well, especially after everyday use by a toddler.When the couch is unfolded, the seams that attach the main couch to the fold out are coming apart a bit, but its not a huge deal.My daughter likes to "read" so they help keep a few books close and somewhat organized.I have bought many other brands before but this one is far more superior.All of my others have shrunk/ripped or fallen apart weeks after purchasing.These are definitely worth the extra $$ you really do get what you pay for.I LOVE THIS STROLLER!!!I tried the Maclauren for its hype...I just hated it.It's only good features were maneuverability and its lightweight.I bought this stroller without a chance to test it out....but i was very pleased with it!I do have a couple complaints about this Zooper model: the sun cover broke after its first use :( and the brake mechanism is a bit weak (you really have to make sure the brake is properly set).It could use a handrail piece like the white version of this strollers shows in its picture (is it only featured on the white models?Its features are worth 17 lbs ;)Like everyone else, I was overwhelmed with the choices in strollers.I ended up choosing the Zooper Twist because I wanted something a little better than a simple umbrella stroller but not so big and heavy as a full size one.That was what really won me over for the purchase and my favorite feature.It is HUGE and there's lots of ways to use it.-Nicely padded seats and comfortable seat belts.-Fully reclines so my child can sleep in it (with the nice sunshade pulled down) or you can change a diaper (haven't had to try that yet but I'm sure you could).-Extras like the rain cover and sleeping bag.-Stays up even with a diaper bag attached to it (and even other items like purchases).-Really nice styling and variety of colors (not a fan of all the orange, black or red strollers out there).Overall, it's a really nice looking stroller that I am generally happy with although I'm not sure I'd purchase again.This is my first stroller so I don't have others to compare to (I have used one of the MacClaren umbrella stroller models which pushed and maneuvered like a dream but it didn't have any of the features I wanted).I think the sunshade is such a huge plus that I'll continue to use this stroller for a while.I might think about switching up models later though I don't think many strollers have all the features of this one and still be lightweight.Our son is 16 months and 27 pounds, and this stroller is a breeze to push him in.Infant strollers are wonderful, but true stroller engineering comes into play when you are pushing really heavy toddlers, and looking for a lightweight option.When I put my son in the twist, I couldn't even tell he was in the stroller.I am so happy we came across this stroller.This stroller performs so well, we just love it.Love the various recline positions, including full recline.We have checked this stroller on 4 flights now and used it overseas on cobblestone and uneven surfaces, on the beach in the Caribbean, and around town at home.I can't be more pleased.Our son seems very comfortable in it.The foot rest part that can be extended up is sturdy and seems better quality than the Maclaren.Lots of practical design features and it drives great.When I received it I thought it was great.The book has spaces for photo on one side and topics on the other.I am not good at scrapbooking and this book was wonderful so that I could put together a nice little history for my son.Each page has small suggestions on what to put on each page which is helpful, and on the family tree page, I plan to order small wallet size pictures of his grandparents, great-parents wedding photos if I can round them all up.I also recommend for preserving family memories the Family Tree Legacies: Preserving Memories Throughout Timeby Alison Stacy.Well organized and lots of room to record memories.Easy to insert photos, but it would be nicer to have some kind of plastic protection.It does a great job keeping her clothes clean and catching all of the finger foods that she drops!We have two of these bibs and have no complaints.The package says the minimum age is 8 months, but I've used it on my 5 1/2 month old.The size is also right for my younger baby.I bought the blue Bibbity for my son.I actually like this bib better because it flexes around our son's neck instead of the firm plastic which just pushed up into his face.I don't want my son eating paint.My son is 18 months and is in the 90th percentile in height, all torso, so I thought it would be to short for him too.Actually I like the length because his high chair or booster seat trays don't interfere with the pocket.The Bibbity is a little tricky to get folded up because it wants to unfold itself, but if you can get it tucked in the pocket just right it does stay, as well as it will fit a fork and spoon in the pocket too.We have been using it at home as well as around town when going out.It washes off quickly and easily and you don't have to wait for it to dry before use.I was a little skeptical when I first bought it but frankly I love it.I LOVE not having to clean dried food off fabric bibs or do more laundry.For the price especially it is awesome.Bought a pink one for our daughter too, even though she isn't born yet- this will be great to have once we start her on solid foods.At this price I'm keeping it in my Amazon wishlist to give to friends who have babies too!****2nd update**Still love it!Got the pink for my daughter, now 8 mos and eating solids, and have bought these as gifts for friends.LOVE IT!This didn't work for our 8 month old.The plastic is molded inward towards the middle part of the bib so it doesn't catch anything.My son also does not like the way it feels around his neck, he is constantly pulling on it.I bought this bib by accident, anticipating a trip.Little did I know it was PERFECT!My son was ~16 months old when we started using this and wanting to feed himself all the time.This is the only bib we ever use anymore at home, and when it was tragically forgotten while on a visit to my parents', we went out an bought another one rather than use one of the few cloth one we had around.One of the few baby items that I think everyone should have.Unfortunately my son does not like wearing it, I think it irritates his neck.Also, it doesn't seem to catch any food.The front part of this bib is somewhat molded inward (not sure if it was from the packaging or what) so it doesn't catch anything.It catches everything, easy to clean and very sturdy.I always give it as a baby shower gift to friends.About the same size, with a pocket, waterproof, washable, and will not mold or mildew.Regardless of this fact, I would buy these again over the Bumkins for a baby - they are superior in every respect!I like telling what temperature it is in the room and this seemed like a cool  thermometer but it too long to adjust and I did not find it very accurate either.Also, I would much rather prefer if it were battery operated to I can put it anywhere I want without having to plug it in.This is a cool thermometer, looks good, novel ideal.However, I found it was not very sensitive to temp.It doesn't always reflect the true room temperature.It is a perfect glow for night..not too bright or too dim.Works great, I like that it changes colors to let you know the temp.It has a tendency to read 2-3 degrees higher than our thermostat for the house, which is about 15 ft away (and is closer to the heater).But I do feel that its ballpark temperature is accurate, even if it's not precise.I enjoy the colors and the smiley face when it is yellow.Be aware, that this is not a full car seat; but a booster seat for larger toddlers and kids.Otherwise everything about it is top-notch, as you would expect from Britax.However, the unit I received was made in China, so FYI for folks who are concerned about these things.We bought 2 of these to replace our beloved Britax Starriser Comfy but these were too high in the seat so didn't fit in the 3rd row with older kids (which is who they're made for), too bulky and MADE IN CHINA!!!!I'm glad I bought from Amazon since they have the BEST return policy online!!!!The fabric on the seat is beautiful and seems comfy.I also feel that she is very secure in the seat (when properly belted, see below).It's so difficult to get her properly locked in this seat, as compared to a harness seat (with which she is able to secure herself).I would be afraid to let my child secure herself, as I believe this last step is essential in making this seat safe.I do feel that when properly belted, this is a safe seat.I'm not sure if I would purchase this seat again - over a Graco Turbobooster, yes - however, I may spend the extra $ and buy another Frontier if the choice arises again.We found these Luvable Friends 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets to be very pretty, too small in size, and of not of such good quality compared to other receiving blankets that we purchased.It looked alright even after wash. it has the seams neatly locked in white.!Nice to have, I use this all day for 3 months now and be very ok.Wonderful colors, but they are very thin.They are for a warm city or summer.These blankets are very soft and absorbent.They are the perfect size.We actually use them as an additional layer on top of our changing pad cover.They catch diaper accidents, but are also handy for a quick face wipe if spitup happens.The only negative is one time she had a little diaper mishap and the blanket is now lightly stained... can't seem to get the stain out, but still in love with this blanket and I highly recommend it.Had I known it was going to be so nice, I would have requested a bunch of these organic receiving blankets instead of many others.This blanket is a nice large size... my daughter was 6lbs 3 oz when born, but due to its size and stretch I'm certain that it can easily accommodate a baby as large as 10-12lbs and possibly larger.This is my husband's favorite choice in receiving blankets for swaddling too!These are great blankets for swaddling.They are slightly larger than most receiving blankets, and are made with some stretch so that you can get a nice, tight wrap.Our son has been sleeping more soundly and for longer periods using these than the standard cotton blankets we started out with.The blankets are also very nicely made, very soft, and with a thin ribbing that that makes them visually appealing.These are outstanding blankets, and we use them literally everyday of the week.Highly recommended.I love these blankets, they are just the right thickness and are so very soft and a good size.I would highly recommend these!It's actually nice to have something so simple to assemble for once.My son has loved looking at it since he was 3 months old (now 6 months).The music is pretty good, but there is a setting that has music and a bird singing, and it's my favorite (I'm not sure about the kiddo!).All in all, though, he has always loved to look at it.She laughs and talks to the mobile as it slowly spins around.It's really colorful and looks like something out of a Dr. Suess book.She waves her arms around and smiles as she watches the figures spin around.I also really like the sound quality of the songs it plays -- it's more realistic piano music, and it's quite soothing to have it playing.The colors and the toys are perfect for even a new born.The material is great for the baby to touch or rather hit!The music is great.It is very easy to assemble.Therefore, for twins, you can mute one and run both of them, the music don't get mixed up and annoying.It is a great choice as a mobile.I highly recommend it.I though this mobile was a great idea, and I really wanted my son to like it.My son LOVES this mobile.As soon as he sees it, whether it is on or not he goes crazy with the smiles, the wiggling and the giggling!Two girl friends had recommended I purchase this one instead of the pretty ones that matched the nursery decor.He won't shut his eyes otherwise.It would be nice if when the activity stopped, the power drain stopped too.As parents we love it too - it is cute looking, matches baby decor, sounds nice and (unlike someone else's review) consumes very little battery power.Visiting friends have admired this mobile and wished they had bought it for their own kids.My daughter has a great time when I turn it on!It is a bit disturbing if you intend to use to put the baby to sleep, but it's good to distract the baby and have some time to do some stuff around.The musics are good but the sound is not really good at all.Love the remote control, has many of the same characters that are on her tiny  luv playmat, love that you can turn off the music!My daughter was intrigued from day 1.Now that she is 3 months old she loves to catch the little toys and try to bring them to her mouth.At least they don't make me cringe every time baby puts them in their mouth, since safety standards are much stricter in Europe, and also because they use natural materials (e.g.Also while it fit my orbit seat it barely fit...comes off easily.my baby girl has always hated the car since she was born.Few good features: the musical mirror is fun for my 5 month old son.He loves to pull the string (while I'm holding it) & watch fan go around.The "claws" aren't very secure & when my son pulls on the toys, as he wants to suck on everything, the whole unit pulls down into his face everytime!My son loves looking at it and batting at the toys.I purchased this potty after seeing the reviews and secondly for the color as it matches our bathroom.Everything about the potty is great!!My 18 month year old sits on it everyday at bath time and though we are not fully there in the potty time, she seems to like the potty.This toy is ok...it does make the nice crinkly noise as advertised, but as far as being a "book" and teaching letters and numbers...It has One Apple on the first "page", two birds on the second, and three cat heads on the third page (the name of each item drawn starts with the first three letters of the alphabet: an apple starts with an a, birds starts with a b, and cats starts with a c) and that's it...there are no actual numbers or letters on the toy.The pictures are sewn in light colors as you see on the front with the apple.This is not an educational toy (beyond simple motor skills, color contrasts maybe), but does pass as a regular organic crinkle toy, if you want to pay that much for one.Love this Sage Hamper!The hamper is sturdy and will do fine as a unit.Love the dolphin and the sheep!Wonderful that you can adjust the volume (I found many other white noise plushes very loud).I prefer the music or the ocean for nap time and both make great background noise for dozing off.Other than that, very CUTE, great battery life, good noise options.The calm and relax sounds keep her peaceful during her "quiet, alert, awake" phase.I have it attached to the car seat when we go to doctor's appointments -- in every office we have been in someone asks where to buy one.It is fantastic.*Although I do not have the regular-size Dolphin, I do have the regular size (and on-the-go size) Sleep Sheep.My 5 month old babies love the red cube in particular.The fight over it everyday...Okay so they don't physically fight over it...but when one has it the other tries to get it too.The red one is a "crinkly" material and I wish they were all like this.The images and colors on the red one also keep their interest the most.It has a lot of black/white/red on it that babies love.I have washed them and they do wash well.I think they are great quality.I am considering getting another set so they both can play with the red one at the same time!worth every penny for my ears to get a rest!We got this one first, and the music globe plays very pleasant music, my baby liked this gym when he was one to three months old, and with additional links and toys added (LOTS of them) he loved it.In the Baby Einstein gum, the two arches are held together in the same direction, while the Fisher Price Rainforest gym has them crossing each other.Only now, as he is standing and pulling himself up all the time has he even begun to abandon the two baby gyms.But he still loves the music.My son has played with this since he was a month old!Now at 10 months when he rolls over the whole thing will come with him and he will cover himself with the pad & play peek a boo with it - so fun!He loved it so much that when i thought he outgrew it i got rid of it, the next say my little one noticed it was gone (didnt think he would) and laied down on the floor and stated looking up and kicking and moving his arms.I might even buy an extra so I don't have to move it around - she loves it that much.Daughter loves these.I bought this because my daughter hated tummy time and I thought it would help her enjoy being on her tummy more.Perfect size for my 5yr old and seem very well made.This is a nice set.The carrying case is useful for bringing it places.They are first of all adorable and sturdy easy to clean and he loves eating with them.He is 2 years old.But I bought them for him about the age of 1 .I bought him several pairs.I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son.It fits him well, it's just the right size.Though I agree with other reviewers that the straps are sewn on too far apart from each other at the top.This makes it easy to slip off.If the straps were closer together at the top of the bag allowing for a more comfortable fit I'd rate it 5 stars.I may have to get a mitten clip like one person said they did.The large velco flap is easy for him to open and close.It's lightly padded all around, which I'm sure allows for more comfort, so he's not feeling every toy or book poking through.He just wants to fill it up and wear it!I got it as a toy more than anything, and for him to take a few things with him and spare pants/undies when we go out, so I don't have to carry his stuff.I ran it through the washer on cold in the "hand wash" setting and hung it up to dry.The edges of the flap crunched up a tiny bit.I think it looks great considering it went through the wash, and is actually a bit softer now.I'm happy to know I can wash it and it's ok!UPDATE 12/28/11 - Just bought another one for my second son.The robot style, since he loves "bo-bots."Can't wait to give it to him for his second birthday!I love these, and the kids do too!The original, now 2 1/2 years old, is doing very well.I have been able to avoid having to wash the robot one and it's still nearly like new!We will be giving our daughter her's on her 2nd birthday in two days and she's going to be so excited to be just like her brothers!My only complaint would be the limited girl styles.We settled for one with owls and hearts and not too much pink.I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter, despite an earlier review about the straps being too wide.This is true, the straps are too wide and fall off my daughter's shoulders if it is not positioned exactly right.But I have rectified the issue by using a mitten clip (it's a mini suspender) to pull the straps together across her front.The sizing is wonderful, the pattern is cute, and it's not advertising for anyone (Disney etc.).I am very pleased with it, and would give it a 5 star if the straps were a little closer together, or if it came with a clip that you could just put across their chest to fix it.Mitten clips are easy to find and very inexpensive (a couple of $$).It's well worth it.UPDATE (July 2011): My daughter is now 3yr3mo and the straps fit fine.I was a bit surprised to see how small it is.A bit expensive considering after I ordered it I found a mini back pack that was a fraction of the cost but it wasn't as cute and didn't have the front compartment.I love it.I had to tie it to keep the drink from falling out, but other than that, it is still an adorable little backpack.I love it!I love this cute little back pack.We get lots of compliments on it where ever we go.It's the perfect size for a toddler and the straps are adjustable.It's sturdy and well made, and though it's on the small side, it holds just the right amount of stuff, (which for us is a lot since I'm an over-packer anyway).The side pouch is the perfect fit for a sippy cup.They are sturdy, cute, and affordable.Perfect size for a preschooler.I HIGHLY recommend!I bought this for my 13 months old little girl.she doesn't have books or folders to carry around.I usually carry some toys, a sweater, and maybe a blanket.No inner zippered pocket or even just a pocket inside the main compartment.I wear this for my kid because he's too small to wear it.Different animals is more fun!These are nice and sturdy and good size for little walkers.It fits his- smallish for a 4 1/2 year old- back perfectly but still fits an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper (the requirement for his school).It would fit a full sized water bottle in the side, but he will never need that for preschool.The front pouch is insulated, but once again this isn't really necessary for a preschooler.It is well constructed, it feels very sturdy, and I am hoping to get a few boys worth of use out of it.Mostly I picked it because it is cute without being girly, a hard combination for a mother of two boys to find.I tried to get him to pick the owl or bumblebee, but the zebra it was!I bought the Dog backpack for my 17 month old based on the previous reviews and I'm happy I got it for him now.The size is perfect for him, it has a snack pouch, the colors are super vibrant, well constructed, and he loves carrying it around making dog noises.And this backpack is absolutely adorable, so I would give it 5 stars for that if I could.So if you're on the lookout for a nice school-sized backpack, look elsewhere!Insulated front pocket is perfect for juice boxes and other snacks.We've gotten lots of compliments on it already!Our son loves monkeys and loves this backpack.It's the perfect size for our 26 month old.I own 2 of these carseats - one for each car - and I have been very happy with them.PROS:-They are easy to install, and switching from rear facing to forward facing is easy.-It is easy to buckle your child into the seat properly, yet my 2.5 year old has not yet been able to figure out how to unbuckle herself which I consider a good thing.-You can tighten or loosen the restraints very easily with one hand-The seat seems sturdy and has some side protection as well.-The carseat is very comfortable for children of various sizes (17lbs - 35lbs in my experience, I haven't tried it with smaller/larger children) even on long car rides.-It is easy to remove the padding/cover to wash it.-I can fit both seats in the backseat of my Jetta without any trouble (forward facing only), they aren't too huge.CONS:- The chest buckle slides up and down easily, which is nice for adjusting the harness as the child grows, but my child has been able to slide the buckle down and get her arms out even when fastened in tightly.You need to pin a safety pin just below the buckle so they are not able to wiggle out and so that the buckle doesn't slide down on it's own.- If you were going to use the seat rear-facing it would take up a lot more room in your car.All in all, a great value and a safe, comfortable seat.I only used it forward facing.It looks and feels comfortable and my son could sleep comfortably in it - not to mention that the price is very reasonable.I hope to never be in that situation again, but it is good to know this is a reliable seat and my child loves it.I have a second son and bought one for him as well.I am reviewing this car seat based on its use in my Audi Q7(small SUV).One is rear-facing for my 3 month old and the other is forward-facing for my 2 year old.PROS:  The seat seems comfortable, easy to clean, is nice looking and was affordable for a seat that can be used up to 50 lbs.This may be because the seats are slightly bucket style.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.The cushions and cup holder are nice additions.This is a great tub.It has many awesome features.The infant sling holds a newborn safely and seems to be very comfortable.We have yet to convert it from it's newborn status but it looks as though the "big girl" setting will work just fine.Two features that I LOVE: 1.The temperature gauge, very convenient and safe.My son is two months and he loves taking baths.Used this on top of deck stairs and works well but latch difficult to open and is starting to rust.It's amazing what a little "humming" technology can do to help a young child relax, especially in a new environment.The tough velcro, however, will keep the belly closed tightly.But, I am confident that he will love it as soon as he better understands his surroundings and becomes more interactive with his toys.This bear has very small eyes, like they are closed, or perhaps he is very sleepy, which is very cute :-)The most important part of the bear, of course, is his gentle shivering touch.Vibrate and heartbeat allow you to control the patterns vibration on the bear; Vibrate is a constant vibration while heartbeat allows a pause, like a real heartbeat.The actual fur is very nice, it does NOT shed with regular wear and tear.Heck, I'd probably sleep with it if my husband let me :-)ENJOY!I purchased the giraffe instead of the sheep or the dolphin because my son loves Sophie the giraffe.i no longer use it because when it shuts off my baby wakes up.I wish I bought these sooner!I purchased three of these pocket/all-in-ones in size medium for the babysitter to use.I decided to do three more washes and see if that helped.I realize that when it comes to an item like this, it will never be perfect.These are much more convenient then the diapers our mother's and grandmother's mastered.I started out by ordering one of each of the best reviewed brands.They are cheaper (even more so since I don't have to order a separate diaper cover) and work just as well or better.I like the leg gussets, although they sometimes dig into my little ones very chunky legs, they are great at preventing leaks.They seem to be very adjustable, which will be great when my little one starts crawling and thins out some.He is 24 lbs now and fills up the medium.Maybe that is why, even with good inserts, she woke up soaked from head to toe.If your child is near the 40lb mark I would find something else to use.Very nervous about ordering my daughters crib on-line, very very nervous.But after checking out the local shops and looking at almost every crib here on Amazon I felt a bit more confident and ordered this one.Wow.So far both the grandparents have commented on how pretty it is.It's solid once assembled.To convert it to a day bed you have to remove the bolts.We'll see how well it withstands the test of time.It is very sturdy and will perform great, I'm sure.My husband and I put it together quite easily.I'm happy with the quality for the price.We expect it to keep going for quite some time....Would highly recommend!Easy installation, very sturdy, feels safe, and really stunning.So happy we made this purchase.I wanted a crib that was sturdy enough yet reasonably priced.I figured I'd take a chance, and I'm glad I did.It's lightweight enough to be easily moved but it doesn't feel or look cheap at all.It looks great with the matching changing table.You definitely need two people to assemble it, unlike the table which I was able to do by myself.The cherry color is very pretty and my husband and I don't have any worries that it will be safe enough for the baby when the time comes.I bought this crib after it was recommended by the book Baby Bargains.I thought, "Why buy a $1000 set of nursery furniture when we'll only use them for a few years?It's not a bargain if it won't last through all of the children we hope to have.The color is beautiful and it's super sturdy.Very easy to assemble.They made life livable those few days, allowing me to put my bra back on without wincing after I fed my baby.We bought this set as a baby shower gift - usually I receive amazon orders in 3-5 days, but this one took more than a week.It is absolutely gorgeous especially the "boots idea".So no need to buy a gift box.I wish somebody made such a gift to my son on a baby shower :)Bought for my 9-mo old grandgirl and it came a couple days ago.My son and DIL took it out to a restaurant last night they loved it.Last year I purchased the front rail cover for my daughters' conversion crib and it is more than generous in size to accommodate her sleigh style crib.Thankfully it came in real handy when my son started standing in his crib.But then what was I to do with the side rails?Thankfully Amazon carries the matching side rail covers.These are a nice ivory color, which helps hide the drool spots, lightly padded (which I didn't think would protect the wood from teething babies but I was wrong), and very easy to install and remove for laundering.My sons' convertible crib has curved side rails so I wasn't sure how well this would stay on due to the strip of velcro in the center, but it has done marvelously.I highly recommend these if you want to protect your investment.These "covers" aren't exactly beautiful, but he was ruining the crib.They are a bit big for the sides, but they work perfectly.And actually fit just fine.Like another reviewer said, this isn't the most stylish crib accessory.But if your goal is to protect the crib rails from baby bites, it does the trick!My son is a teething monster, but the crib rails still look brand new.These are easy to install, and easy to remove and (machine) wash out the baby slobber.It fits my crib great and seems to do the job.He has not tried to bite the rails anymore.I ordered one of these (and received the pink bunny version) to use for my 18-month-old twins when they get the inevitable bumps and bruises of toddlerhood.One of my sons actually burst into tears when I brought it out and wouldn't let it get anywhere near him.I think a brown or other more natural color might actually be better?The first time or two I brought it out, he would touch it but not let me put it on the spot that needed it.He does better with it than with a normal ice pack, so that's something!We love the Safe Sippy Bottle.I had to purchase brushes to do so.Other than that complaint, we're happy.Baby loves them, so we live with it.But now I have found a great toy that my son LOVES and I like the looks of it too!My 3.5 month old son loves looking at himself in the detachable mirror, and playing with the multiple toys attached to the arches.The colors and patterns are more "adult" and go decently with our house, and my son loves the contrast.I would highly recommend this to anyone with a young baby.This activity gym is great.Colors and patterns are really cute too!I was surprised to see this labelled as "boys" because I bought it in a store for my little girl.Pretty small for storage - folds up easily and pops out just as easily2.)The mat is fairly small - actually, this is a bit of a pro for us, because we live in a tiny space - but if you want something where your baby can roll and roll and roll, you might look for something biggerFinally, my husband remembers his siblings having gyms that the top bars stood separately.These must attach via clips to the mat in order to arch.This is the only gym I've ever had/seen so I don't know if they make them where the arches stand alone or not.It would be a nice feature because you could then set it on whatever surface you wanted.Overall, I'm satisfied.I got this for my son when he was 1 and a 1/2 months.He instantly fell in love with it and could be easily occupied with it for up to an hour.He is now 4 months old and he still loves it.The colors are very vibrant and when he's on his tummy he loves to stare at the patterns and colors of the squares.The folding feature is nice since we don't have a lot of space so when I need to get it out of the way it's really easy to do.I LOVE this playmat and my son does too.He is 6 months old now and still loves it.It has even gone on our trips and fits nicely in a large suitcase.Right out of the box, the Twist and Fold Activity Gym was super simple to put together.It came in just a few pieces and I had it together in around three minutes.The colors are what struck me the most.It looks like a beautiful quilt that your grandma would make, no kidding.When I went to put it away, he cried.I would have never thought I could take an activity gym to the park or to Nana's house.With most gyms, you would have to disassemble them and find a way to keep up with all of the pieces.It really is that simple!The material is easy to clean, the colors are gorgeous, the characters are so cute, and it is portable!I can say that without a doubt after reviewing this that I would buy it in a heartbeat.I use this every time I bathe my son and it works great.If I made the water to what I thought was warm, I would probably have burned my son.Works instantly and its easy to use.Initially, I bought 10 of the honey colored Avent bottles to start my collection because I wasn't aware of any differences.They are fine, however, I do experience a leak from time to time with them.But these Avent bottles are perfect - no issues!I wish I had known about these and bought them from the beginning.I bought 4 of these from Amazon and although I still use the other ones (what else am I going to do with them?)I always reach for these first.FYI - The little booklet that came with these says that you can get more adapter rings from Avent customer service, so I'm going to call them to see if I can get some of the rings for my honey colored bottles...  Maybe that will help with the occasional leaks I experience with those bottles?They are BPA free and so easy to clean, even though there is an additional piece.These bottles have been perfect for both of my babies!Both babies were in the NICU using specific bottles and nipples in the NICU.However, once we came home, we transitioned to the Avent 4 ounce bottles then the 9 ounce bottles and the transition was perfect!Love the bottles.Highly recommend.I love these bottles!I've used them for 13 months now and highly recommend them.They also don't have a million parts to clean like many of the other bottles out there.They're simple, inexpensive, BPA free and do the job perfectly!You just have to make sure you screw the lid on tight enough.They do leak horribly.These make for an easy transition between breast and bottle.It also makes them easy to clean.I like how the air enters the bottle under the ring and not through the nipple.Knowing what I know now, I would go with Dr. Brown's.My only complaints are that the markings do chip away.Unlike the normal bottle where you just attach the nipple, these bottles require a separate ring to be attached before you can screw on the nipple.Plus it's another piece to wash and keep up with.On the plus side, formula seems to slide down the edges of this bottle quicker than the yellow ones, so you don't throw as much away.My son loves these bottles/nipples.He is nine months old now and he still loves them.The best on the market... intriguing to baby and very soft to stop the bumps of learning to sit, stand, walk.Does not have the chemical smell that the others have, so no need to air out for a couple of days.I bought this play mat and the pink/brown one to make one large play mat for my daughter.It was easy to put together.I also think these are softer and I love the circles much more than the letters and numbers because the kids pull them out and you can just toss them back in.These small pieces get lost.I give it five stars!I only bought one package because I only needed a small area covered.But I might by more and get rid of the rug in my son's room.I decided to purchase this playmat set for my 4 month old son so he could have a safe place to play on the floor (no carpet at our house).We have had the set for 2 months now and I like it for the most part.The pieces stay together nicely and the foam is cushy (about 1/2 inch thick).I like that there are endless ways to arrange the pieces (it will make a great puzzle when my son is older).This mattress is lovely.It is nice and firm, and even know that he is rolling over in the middle of the night, we aren't that worried about it smothering him in any way.Colgate mattresses are highly rated in Baby Bargains, so we chose the Eco version, and we are pleased with it.It fit our Bonavita crib perfectly.I got this for my one month old daughter and it works perfectly.It is easy to put baby in right after a bath so she doesn't get cold, and its super cute, she seems to be nice and cozy when she is in it and it does a good job of drying her off.I've used it about 5 times so far and I'm very happy with the quality and it really helps to simplify my life when I'm trying to keep her warm while I get her clothes together, and have to carry her to the other room..My daughter will able to use this blanket for many years to come!It is so adorable and extremely soft.Love this!I love these plates!I wish I had gotten them sooner.These are very colorful and most importantly, my 2 1/2 year old LOVES them.I also have the bowls and cups and again, LOVE THEM.Perfect size, sturdy and colorful.They wash off nicely in the dishwasher.These are fine plates and I would recommend them.I would highly recommend these plates.They wash up really well in the dishwasher.The edges of the plate are raised which helps food stay on the plate.There is also a rubber bottom on the plates that helps keep it in place for my baby.Great plate.They are sturdy and have a little grip on the bottom, so they don't slip out from under my toddler while he eats.Rubberized bottom is awesome.Nice addition to the bowls we already owend.Great gift.I prefer this in almost all ways to the KidCo food mill of similar shape and function.)Keep in mind that this isn't a blender and food will end up a bit textured.I didn't want to pay $50 for a stainless steel grinder so this is a great second place.It's super simple to put together and understand.Super easy to clean.For first foods- avocado, sweet potato, banana... this think is great.For second foods- squash, peas, carrots...it's great.I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.I'm not sure what she made in it, but I find it incredibly messy and not worth the effort.Works okay for small, fairly dry meals (like spaghetti).Liquidy foods just squirt out the bottom and leak all over the counter.I saw this food mill and thought I'd try it out since it's super inexpensive.I kept making my own baby food but I never bought the fancy processor - this mill does the job.If you're looking for a really smooth puree, you're going to be dissapointed.It says it separates skin from fruits but it leaves lots of little bits of skin, so I always just removed the skin first.This mill is easy to clean and is dishwasher safe.Love it!If you don't set your expectations too high, this food mill works just fine.But, as long as the foods you grind are cooked well and cut into small pieces, the mill does a good job of grinding it into a smoother texture for the baby and straining out the more fibrous parts.I bought 2 of these because I make a lot of baby food at once.Works great.I freeze them in a 1 qt ziplock and label it before I freeze them.Great for mixing foods to expand a baby's pallate.These trays are perfect.Plain and simple, they are very flexible, easy to use and easy to clean b/c they go in the dishwasher.We loaned the tray out to a friend who then bought several more for herself b/c she loved them so much.It is very easy to get the cubes out of the tray, unlike hard plastic trays that are generally used for ice cubes.These bend every which way and the cubes pop right out.HIGHLY RECOMMEND.My only complaint is that it can be difficult to get that first cube out.It would also be cool if it came with a lid.But I didn't dock points for no lid, since I knew it didn't come with one.Otherwise it's great.Some reviews mentioned it was hard to remove the cubes...the first one takes a bit of wiggling, but once one is out, the rest come pretty easy.So I don't always have to bring a separate sippy cup.It's also very small, so very portable and easy to take on trips.I thought this was a great creation, but it doesnt work well with nursery water bottles.I can give it to my daughter and not worry.it is just plastic bowl with some rugged bottom so that you can grind food against it.It is a good size and easy to hold bowl.The lid is tight so food won't leak.I have taken fruit in it and grind it just before feedingI needed something to heat my daughter's food that was quick and easy.This bowl isn't the item you want if you want to quickly bring food from fridge temp or frozen, unless you plan on taking things out at least an hour ahead of time.That said, it does keep food nicely warm and the weight of the water does help, in my opinion, with keeping the suction down for as long as it stays down.I wouldn't leave my child unsupervised with this plate, especially when it was full of hot water.Another note, the manufacturer could have thought of an easier way of getting the water inside.My son (5 months) old and just started eating baby food.I feel good knowing that I am not putting his food in a container that could leach harch chemicals into it with this plate.Great bowl.Keeps food warm for a long time.Has held up great to multiple feedings and hand/diswasher washings.Wish I had found these sooner!It has a waterproof lining INSIDE between the front and back cloth linings, so there is no vinyl/plastic exposed.When I purchased them my son was 5 months old and they were a great fit.It was funny because I bought 4 of these, each with a different food and the only one that had a bigger neck opening was the "takeout" one.I also "heart" this brand, so that's an added bonus!They are a lot bigger than I thought they would be and the sweat shirt type neck is very practical- no velcro or tying.It might work alright on a 2-3 year old, but definitely not for a baby.They are fantastic!The leg gussets close the leg off without being tight (no leaks!These work really great, they keep everything in.I love them both but the Duo Wrap is awesome because it's adjustable.I studied carefully before picking out a diaper system.Cost was important, but so was longevity and leak proofness.Reading all of the reviews the choice was clear... Thirsties hands down!But people said "try multiple systems, it might not fit your child!".The buck stops here for cost and for quality.Cost wise and leak prevention wise!Rarely does anything get on the cover even, and never once on their clothes.My twin boys are a month old, and the duowraps fit better than the regular.But to do it over I'd get only the duo wrap, since you only ever need 2 sizes!My 7 pound boys dropped to 6.5 pounds, and are now almost 9 pounds, and duowraps are the BEST!Any other system is going to cost you about 10 times that.Prefer the original.These are great in theory that they can last longer...yet I doubt they will take my son to 18lb.The original are sized bigger, giving more room.Great colorsI love this wrap partly because it holds in wetness well and partly because it fits so well!I love these!I love the gussets these covers have (As mentioned by a few reviewers).They really keep everything in, which is important with an infant who still has very runny stools.The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because, as mentioned by someone else, these do run small.I never got to use any of the smaller sizes on this diaper!It wouldn't fit over the prefold if I snapped it to a smaller size.My son is now approx.14 lbs and its time to move up to the larger size.Overall, very happy.Worth the price.I have several of the sized thirsties, as well as both sizes of the duos.If you can afford it I would go with the sized thirsties instead.I recently bought a flip one size diaper cover and I have to say that after just 2 uses I am impressed with it instead of the duos.We use prefolds and the flip worked fine and contained my sons very large poop very well.Mostly I snappi my cloths, but everything works just as well if I don't.(I wash about every other day) So they have been washed quite a bit so far, and are still like new!I have no desire to try another type of cover.awesome color.fast friendly service.I love these.I use one with a bamboo fleece insert in my son's pocket diapers at night and he lasts 6 hours with them together.They really hold the urine well, better than microfiber in my opinion.Well worth the extra money, especially if your baby is a super-soaker.Either way, with my other inserts that have begun to smell a little, I just treat with some Bac-out and it's gone.I am surprised.I assume the hemp is really pulling the moisture away from her skin.I use these overnight in my daughter's fuzzi bunz as an extra stuffer in addition to the microterry inserts that came with the diapers.I bought this and the baby kicks at the same time.I did, and they absorbed well from their first use.Keep in mind that they will shrink for the first few washes, but they are big enough to do so.These inserts are very absorbent, and they fit my happy heinys pocket diapers perfectly.The best combo is one layer of microfiber insert closest to baby, with the hemp insert behind that.The microfiber is quick to absorb, and the hemp helps keep the moisture put.They are trim and the size small fits well with a prefold diaper in a size small PUL wrap (Bummis or Thirsties).They pull the moisture down to the prefold, instead of just getting soaked after one pee.I wash these with my prefolds and wraps and have not experienced any stinkiness, staining, or repelling.I love these inserts.They are nice but I much prefer these.The BabyKicks are wider, even in the center where the hourglass shape is.I really like the comb the most because it has regular teeth on one side but the other side has wider teeth and it's great for hair that is hard to comb.The brush is great too for smoothing down his hair and getting it into place.I don't use the brush quite as much though.Soft, pretty and work very well.My daughter even enjoys it when I brush her hair.Luckily I bought this since my newborn came with a head full of hair and also some unexpected cradle cap.I just rubbed a little baby oil on his scalp and eyebrows and used this brush and the nasty little flakes came right off.it wasn't too rough on my new baby.I don't really use the comb it came with but the brush is really handy.I have used this (juice colored) seat for my daughter for the first 6 months.We got it b/c it fit on the Quinny buzz stroller, and thought it would be useful for when she was too tiny for the regular stroller attachment.It did fit the stroller fine.In the car, it can be a bit of a pain to get the top part latched into the base, and it never seems to align correctly -- sometimes the straps underneath get in the way, and you can't fit it in right.And it is *heavy*.It feels awkward carrying it, and I can only make it very short distances.Based on these, I would have probably given it 3 stars.However, I just saw that independent "car seat chemical" testing on it (you'll need to look-up the web site yourself) revealed lead in the shade and clip.Antimony is in the seat.This one is very intuitive and easy to use.The seat is easy to pop in and out of the base, and is secure when in the base.I use it with theMaxi-Cosi Foray Stroller - Choco Mint, and t is easy to put onto the base of the stroller and take off.I am a BIG fan of this seat.With this next one, I went to consumer reports and asked everyone I knew why they liked their seat.So no complaints here.Anyway, very happy.And this  is currently rated #2 in Consumer Reports over the combi seat, but it is because of the "ease of using a shoulder seat belt" over the Combi.I bought this when my daughter was 4 months old and already teething.She still loves it at 7 months.This is absolutely one of her favorites!The teether has not been used yet, but after examining and washing I think it is of great quality.The one I received is blue and in a hand shape, each finger has different designs in the raised rubber for different textures for teething baby.I would highly recommend to other caregivers of teething infants.I have a Medela PIS from years back that I use at work.I could never use it at work as I would disrupt my whole office.I also don't find the horns and the suction to be that comfortable.I think the PIS is worth the extra $100.I used a avent isis with my son for 7 months, then packed it away.2 years later i brought it out when i had my daughter.i did a lot of research & bought the ameda off a friend & absolutely love it.but if i wait 30 mins after my baby eats,  i am able to get at least 2-3 oz.i was shocked how fast it works.it has only 5 parts to wash (including the optional 'aerola stimulator' - which i recommend just for comfort) i soak everything in hot water for a few mins, then wash with a bottle brush.every few uses, i sanitize everything in the avent microwave sanitizer (also an awesome product)highly recommendI bought it for her at 4 months old.However, I think that it is just darling.I would suggest this to anyone that would ask, but have them keep in mind that maybe below a year old it isn't that exciting for them.It is very stylish and matches perfectly with their line of storage boxes.It can easily be folded up for storage.My only complaint is the lid does not match up very well.In order to keep the lid from falling in, I have to slightly pull it as I put it down.It is a minor inconvenience.They are great!These boxes fit on the shelves perfectly, and they are not so tall that you have to pull them out to see what is inside.It keeps little items organized and the shelves look clean and neat.I use one for pacifiers, pacifier wipes and pacifier straps.Another for nail clippers and other grooming items.They are very sturdy, made of a thick canvas type material and they easily collapse to be stored until you need them again.A must have for any nursery.I have the Chicco Key fit seat.The Arctic bundle me works as described and keeps our son warm in very chilly weather despite not needing to wear a winter coat underneath.We have it attached to a Uppa Baby Vista stroller and it fits like it was custom made for it.It will also work on the G-Lite umbrella stroller if needed.We would highly recommend this product to anyone in need of a warm option to a bulky bunting or winter outfit/coat.Bought this to protect our little one from Ohio's frigid winters.I own the JJ Cole Arctic Bundle, Urban Bundle and the Original Bundle.That being said my daughter is two and I started using these when she was one.I use these with a Baby Trend Jogger and an Uppa Baby Vista.The Arctic has a better configuration for the Uppa Baby's sunshade that attaches to the top of the stroller.The Urban one is less stiff and works better on the jogger.Both are a good investment if you are going to be out regularly through the fall/winter months in cold climates.Last winter we used a combo of the Urban and a vinyl cover which my daughter was not thrilled about having the vinyl cover on--but was happy to be in the Urban bundle.This Chicco seat makes him much more a part of the family.It has a nice expansive grip so it fit over our large table lip.The tray is a GREAT size to wash in the sink, and oddly enough, made out of a really pleasant feeling material that I haven't felt on other baby items before.This seat looks like it would have been easy to design differently - wish they had.Our table was weakened by somewhat loosened screws, which I didn't really notice.Overall, I am pretty happy with this purchase.Sizzling hot fajitas in the cast iron skillet seems scary to me.Some places may not have a highchair or one with safety straps that are not broken, this is the solution.It was wonderful to travel with when we flew to visit family over the Christmas break.It folded up very small in our suitcase and hooked right on the table at the in-laws.My husband attaches it while I carry the kid into the restaurant.I bought this chair for my daughter when she was able to sit up fully by herself, around 6 months...We frequently visit family/relatives or go out to restaurants for family gatherings.This clip-on chair is fairly easy to travel with, easy to put on and stow away.Our daughter constantly drops food in her seat but I can easily clean it with a damp cloth.The fabric leaves food kind of crusted on and it actually wipes off quite easily.I'll throw it in the wash every now and then just to get it cleaned more thoroughly.The crevice where it allows the chair to swivel does collect tiny food particles, and I take a toothpick and run it through that a few times to get all the stuff out.The chair seems sturdy enough to allow my daughter to bounce in it once in a while.We swivel the chair for two reasons: 1) I turn her 90 degrees to face me instead of the tray when I feed her; 2) I leave her in the chair to watch me do things around the kitchen, like cooking or preparing her food.I feed her before we all sit down to eat, and while the rest of the table eats, I give her snacks to eat/play with.I think it's a great way to practice table manners, even at such a young age.I love the chair and I think it's worth every penny.I purchased this seat for my baby for our trip to the States so that I would not have to pack and travel with the one which we already own.Nevertheless; it is a nice seat and the tray is GREAT, but once again I hated the idea of disconnecting and reconnecting the arms from the seat everytime we went out to eat, which was everyday.I bought this set for a friend of mine, who had a baby a few weeks ago and she loves it (I used soothie bottles with my baby and loved those too), according to her these bottles are awesome.We used the NUK bottles so this was an almost seamless transition.Highly recommend those!So I bought every other soft sippy option.They either wouldn't suck, they dripped, or they wouldn't allow air in so I was constantly squeezing the tips to release the pressure.By that time he had figured how to suck to draw fluid.As opposed to waiting for the bottle to drip and trigger sucking.My first son chewed on everything.I don't understand why more people have not reviewed this version of the pillow.I do believe it has the same dimensions as the regular pillow but it is also encased in a plastic/ vinyl covering that protects the foam from fluids.Babies can be messy creatures and it worried me that I would not be able to give the regular pillow a good washing (it can only be spot cleaned).My son really loves this puzzle stacker.At first, he got frustrated before he figured out how to fit the puzzle pieces together for the perfect stack.I  just received our new mamaroo today, and I absolutely love it.It is very stylish...it looks even nicer than the pictures show.I was a little skeptical at first and was concerned that with all of the motions that it would be very loud, however the mamaroo is so quiet, you almost can't hear it!I'm updating my review.Not so good anymore, I'm going to see if we can get a replacement.He would definitely prefer the motion of a traditional swing (I am guessing) when he is fussy.He especially loves the womb sound and he sleeps very well in it, so it must be comfortable for him.It's just the sound and the size and shape that he likes.The ball mobile isn't important either.He'd much rather look out the window or at a ceiling fan.I would only give it 4 stars except for we use this thing all the time; and I think a traditional swing wouldn't be as comfortable for him.I wish the fabric was soft its hard and has a rough feel to it, I have inserted a super soft kiddopotamus insert and my son likes the seat much better now.Very disappointed that the top speed is so slow.We were a bit cramped for space so the chair is ideal due to its small footprint.On our pediatrician's recommendation we strapped her in thinking it would be just another sleepless night for again.8 hours later both of us had sleep and were less irritable and our daughter was delightfully happy and not cranky in the morning.Both of us sleep and it's quiet enough to have next to the bed.We were sad to have to return this.First of all the design and assembly are simply amazing.We tried and tried but it didn't work.Design wise this is beautiful, but in terms of functionality I can see why most go for the traditional swings now.The Nosefrida works so well on clearing my baby's nose.It comes with spare filters, so you may want to wait to buy these.She liked the backpack part and didn't seem to mind the tether at all.I am considering sewing or tacking it down somehow to help it be better but I still like it and will continue to use it.These are great - I keep a few in my diaper bag for emergencies with a few ready to feed bottles.I put the panda on my registry though because I like how you can use your own paci, it is a nice size and good quality for what I did see.She happily grabbed it and held on to it tight.She stuffed it into her mouth happily.I can't say that she has abandoned the idea of sticking her hand inside her mouth, but Philips Avent Range Front Teeth Animal is a nice alternative for a majority of the time.Best of all, her parents were happy that the toy is BPA-Free and is made by the reliable Avent company (a division of Phillips).The shape makes it easy for baby to hold on to and get into his mouth.It's not really going to hold his attention unless he's interested in chewing it.My son has used this since about 3 months old.He wasn't great at manipulating it then, but as his dexterity has gotten better, he's continued to love gnawing on it.That nub on the side is his favorite part, but the sides are textured, too.This is a great little teether.I love that it is BPA free so it is completely safe for little ones.Also, the design makes it very easy for small babies to grasp and keep in their hands.The texture is perfect for those first teeth and it isn't too soft but also isn't too hard.We'll keep trying and see if his interest improves.The Philips Avent Range Front Teeth Teether seems to entertain my 10 month old tester well enough!The material is pliable, but sturdy.I wouldn't let the testers 2 year old sister (or any sort of pet) near it, though.It's size seems perfect for my tester!The packaging was easy to open, great for parents who want to have it out and ready in a jiffy.Overall, I have no complaints on this teether!Our daughter is 4 months old and it is easy for her to hold and provides relief for teething pian.I am not sure what kind of animal it is, but it is flexible,has nice texture, my baby likes to chew on it, and it is BPA-free.My baby likes to chew on the nose the best, but he seems to be interested in the other parts, too.It is for the front teeth indeed, it will not go too far back in the baby's mouth.Update:My baby just got his first two teeth yesterday.He chews on the teether throughout the day, seems like it helps him with pain.This teether is very simple.It's the perfect size and shape for small hands, and it doesn't include any extraneous parts that could get in the way of its main purpose.I like that its phthalate-free and BPA-free.Avent categorizes its teethers into three groups:  Stage 1, stage 2, and stage 3.This is a stage 1 teether, which Avent describes as "Front teeth:  Massages gums and suitable for sterilization."Stage 2 is for middle teeth, and stage 3 is for back teeth.Basically, stage 1 is for the earliest stage and is appropriate for small babies.When my first was born almost 6yrs ago I had never even heard of BPA, thankfully we're all aware of this and other potentially dangerous chemicals now and I'm personally glad for the choice when picking items for my newest baby.With all of the concern over BPA I have actually been shocked that so many companies don't label their baby items as being BPA free, leaving me to guess "is it?New parents are often sleep deprived, the last time we need is to play guessing games when purchasing items for our babies, Philips Avent makes it easy with BPA FREE clearly printed right on the package.. LOVE THAT!As for the actual teether, I think its a nice simple and cute design, so many seem to be marketed to us parents when our babies just want something that is easy to hold and fits nicely in their gummy little mouths.This is the perfect size for an early teether and a nice texture.My baby is still early-on in the teething stage, but we tried this and he seems to like it.I still haven't figured out what the shape represents though.The gender-neutral color is nice.She likes it much better than rings filled with water, or other solid teethers.My 4 month old is teething and LOVES this teether.GREAT idea for a baby shower gift!I got this teething ring for myself...okay just kidding, I got this teething ring for my 5 month old son who has just started teething and is always trying to chew on something.I think the little part for the front teeth is neat.Now when he holds the ring himself, he just has at it so-to-speak and does not care if he gets the ring part or the part specifically made for the front teeth, so in that respect, I am not sure if the front tooth nub part really matters.It's easy for my son to hold and grab.I would recommend this teething ring to a friend or family member.My daughter loves this teether as well as the mam tooth brush teether.She can hold it very easily and I think it gives her some relief from teething.excellent teether for my 3.5 month-old.This one is the perfect size and texture for him.It is always the simple things that kids seem to love the most.It is easy for him to hold on to and manipulate in his mouth.The simplicity of design is nice too.The design is intended only for teething of the forward front teeth, so a different toy/teether would need to be used after these came in.There's not much to say about this simply-designed teether other than it's the perfect size for little hands and mouths, and BPA free which is a necessity for my family.My wee one isn't quite teething yet but she's hit a stage where everything goes in the mouth and gets gummed on.This terrific teether meets those three needs nicely.The cute seahorse design is attractive but simple making it easy for my baby to grip and put in her mouth.Unfortunately, she doesn't care for the texture of the teether!I've also found that because it's a brushed rubbery surface cat hair, people hair and lint cling to it like crazy.But I can now say (through shock and awe) that this teether is amazing!Once she got comfortable holding the unusual texture (as mentioned above) my little one began using this teether without much encouragement from me.It fits her small hands perfectly and it's not awkward or anything.However, this item is SO intutitive that he now stays in bed quietly waiting for Mo Mo to tell him its time to wake up rather than calling me as soon as he wakes.This has not helped in the potty training department, but certainly makes my life more predictable!!However, I wouldn't recommend it for children who are overly noise sensitive.The volumne control for the music is nice.I also like the use of military time, as it is less confusing than the AM/FM on my personal alarm clock!All in all, very happy with my purchase!The assembly for the changing table was relatively quick and easy.Obviously the "drawers" are just a canvas material with a few cardboard inserts, but they look OK and are easy to access.(Not that the drawers couldn't be pulled out, but with things tucked away there's less chance that they'll be found.I'll use it for a few years and then get rid of it.It does the job.My only complaint is that the drawers will sometimes fall off of their slats... however...I've run them through the wash a couple of times without any issues.At first, I didn't think I would like these because they didn't have a zipper to securely hold in the messy stuff but after using them for a few months, they are great!These look nice and a good size, but they are remarkably thin and the drawstring doesn't work very well.(Ha, no pun intended.)I'm not crazy about the prints and wish they came in solid colors and maybe an XL size but, other than that, I'm totally impressed.You can't beat the price so I highly recommend them!They have the PERFECT size, are great quality and don't let any wetness throughBut these work nicely for me.I've already machine-washed these bags a few times, and they came out perfect.It also folds up very small, and takes up no room, so it's perfect for storing in a smaller changing kit.The little bag is nice to put spare pump parts in or a pacifier (or 2).These wash and dry well too.This set is so worth it.Love them.They work great.I bought this for our son a few months ago, it has held up well and our 2-year old loves it!This mirror fits my 99 Honda Civic just fine.It's still a grainy image, but the Safety First mirror I bought made me nauseous just to look at it.For $3, I don't expect much - but this is definitely worth the price.I highly recommend it, and for the price, isn't it worth a try?This is a great, inexpensive item that does what it says it does.While one reviewer commented that it is impossible to tell the differences between the stages, it really is not difficult if you can stay organized.I pull the nipples off from the previous stage and put them in a small marked container if I'm going to reuse them for the next one.Of course, if it's that big of a deal, I suppose you can suck on the nipple to determine the flow.Love them!We love these cups, and the smaller version with the handles, it is a great transition cup form the bottle.Below is my original "5 Star" Review which I will leave intact.I initially LOVED this cup, and still love how it works in general.At first, I hoped it was a fluke, and went to buy a replacement top and as far I could tell you can only buy replacement STRAWS, I would have to buy a whole new cup in order to replace that part that my son chewed through, which was upsetting.It was still a great "intro straw cup" for a very short while, but the choking hazard is very scary to me so I am now looking for something with a hard straw that my son can't chew through.Turns out we LOVE these!Ordering a few more today at husband's request, very pleased to have found a good sippy cup, especially since my little one loves straws and never cared much for other style cups.My daughter absolutely loves drinking her milk out of these cups.When she turned 1 yrs old, we wanted to transition her to a cup and she ended liking it so much we didn't have to use the botte anymore!They loved sucking on a straw.These are the only pacifiers that my son ever accepted.The only drawback is that, after a few times washing the pacifier, water tends to collect inside the silicone part that the baby sucks on.I ended up throwing them away after a few weeks and replacing them w/ new ones, out of concern that the water would end up in my child's mouth and make him sick.These blankets are really soft and hold up well wash after wash.My son adored this teether.As soon as we opened it, it was an instant success.He would play with this for almost 30 mins at a time.You have the option of cooling it, but he enjoyed it just fine at room temperature.We'll be ordering another directly!I was a little skeptical because of the strange shape and the fact that it's all one color (we bought blue) so maybe not as stimulating or interesting.However our son loves it!I bought this for $10 and figured it would be okay if he didn't like it, and I only wish I had bought it before I purchased several teethers that were almost twice as much and while cute they aren't used much.It is very easy for even the littlest babies to hold, we've had this since he was 4 1/2 months and he had no problems grabbing it, and it's a plus to have the tiny stimulating bristles to help keep their teeth clean when they do come in.Like the other reviewer I will say that it needs to be cleaned frequently because it will pick up lint and fuzz (and the occasional pet hair), but a quick rinse in water is usually all that's needed and it's so worth it to me to have something that will make our son happy.I've been looking at tons of different brands, etc for a great diaper bag, and accessories such as a wallet/ food tote but couldn't find anything that met the requirements (even in very high end designer bags) until I happened upon Ju Ju Be brand.This Fuel Cell is the perfect accessory to the Ju Ju Be bags for carrying bottles/food, snacks etc.It keeps your bottles cool and ready for baby when your ready to feed.* easy shape to useEvery aspect of this booster seat/diaper bag combo is excellent except 1)the seat is too high for my average 25 month old.The seat part is 5" high.I appreciate the peace of mind knowing that if he's wiggling around in his seat and the booster is on a chair not booth he's not going to wiggle it off and fall on the floor.He's too long int he body to use the harness straps on him but the base can attach securely to the chair and he sits at the perfect height for the tables.with the solid cover I can still get into the diaper bag section without having to unseat my son if I should need something for the baby.I bought this for our 11 month-old son in anticipation of our trip to Asia, but we get plenty of use out of it at home for restaurants and visiting friends and relatives.It is easy to set up and I almost always just use the straps around the back of the chair and not the strap around the bottom of the chair as that seems perfectly secure.The seat also functions as a nice bag for short outings with a compartment that fits a few small toys, food containers, wipes and diapers.Easy, one-hand operation.Sturdy, lightweight.I had the original diaper champ with my first child, and boy do I wish I could find one of those!In my opinon, this is one of those instances where the original is FAR superior to the 'new and improved' version.Pros - it's still nice to be able to use a regular trash bag instead of having to buy a specialized bag.Cons - Whew!Sure, it's not a miracle, (if you have a baby you're just going to have to get used to smelling poop from time to time while changing a diaper) but I certainly don't smell anything in his room thanks to the pail.It doesn't - so to me it's worth it.i'm hoping they at least fixed that flaw with the newer models, but either way, i'm certainly looking for something much more simple to use with my newer gdiaperinggDiapers Little gPants 2-Pack Orange & Vanilla, Small(cloth and biogradable disposable hybrid diapers) system (which is much easier than the prefold and covers method that i used in the beginning of my cloth diapering experience).very simple and a lot cheaper!if you have more than one kid you already know you have to do tons of laundry ANYWAY!)After reading the reviews for this item, I registered for the original Diaper Champ, but ended up with this one instead.I keep it in the bathroom so that we don't have to smell the darn thing all the time.When you give it to your baby, every movement makes it go, so it plays non-stop until you get it from him.They love it and I am very happy with this purchase.The motion sensor for the music is VERY sensitive.Not a big issue unless the cat bumps into it in the middle of the night.I bought this book with the intention of filling it with pictures of my own, so I did - I put in pics of grandmas and grandpas, aunts and uncles, cousins, whom my baby doesn't get to see regularly.I used to go through the book with her before we would visit some of the family members in it or when they would come over, I'd point them out to her.Now, at 8 months, she leafs through it by herself daily!I bought this for my son because I wanted a photo album for him that he could play with and not destroy it!(Haha) He LOVES this book!I have another one sort of like it (theBaby Einstein Baby's Photo Book), but I like this one a little more.Unlike other baby photo albums, this one has black and white pictures and patterns underneath where you insert photos.My son LOVES to look at them, so I haven't even put pictures in it yet!It has held up really well to baby wear and tear!Although this little book is excellent in theory, the fact that there's no way to protect the pictures from the copious amount of drool to which they will be subjected diminishes its utility in practice.A simple tuck-in flap or some other design trick would ideally protect the pictures, which get chewed (and chewed and chewed) and ultimately destroyed in this mouth-friendly toy.It's not a big deal to replace the pictures, but the chemicals that dissolve make me nervous and end up sort of corroding the pages, making the sleeves stick together so much it's hard to insert new pictures.You get to put 8 photos inside plus one for your baby on the cover of the album.It's well made and edges are soft so they won't hurt your baby, my baby loves chewing on it :).You can also change photos every now and then so your baby can get to know the names of family members.My daughter has loved this album for several months now (she's 10 months now).I love it too!It's a great gift.My daughter loves it!Great to teach her about her family and who's dada, mama, grandma, etc... Plus she loves to chew on it and she hasn't had any issues with taking photos out.My son loves to spin the ball and watch the light spin in his car seat at night.Great distraction from the dark and it works great in lowlight as well.We have twins and they played with this at a friends house, and we had to get one for each of our babies and they have had them for 4 months or so now and at a year old still love it, the light is the best part!I bought several mirrors and with this one I can actually see my son since he is in the middle facing rear.This mirror is perfect for your little one.It attaches to crib rails easily with velcro straps.My little 3 month old girl loves it!!The bright contrasting colors mesmerize her and it is perfect size also.I can be used in a crib with velcro tabs or as a stand alone.When the baby lays on the floor, you can set it up easily so they can see themselves from that position.The photo of this product does not accurately reflect what is shipped.In the photo, there is no fabric filling in the gap between the two sides.Okay, it's fairly light so it does tip over easily if not attached to the crib.***update*** I cut the fabric between the two panels in order to separate them so that I can hang this on the side of my baby's playpen -- works great w/this modification!I have a son who has autism and is very sensory oriented.He loves music and he loves feeling different textures, so this was right up his alley!Received it at the baby shower but they got to play with it at about 4-5 months.My twins still love playing with it at nearly 8 months.There's no way to strap it on to anything.Overall, very pleased.If it said "ma" you would pronounce monkey, "ma-onkey."My daughter is 10 months old and LOVES mommy and daddy's books, however she also loves using her 7 teeth to chew them to bits and create a choking hazard.Inside each book shows things that start with that sound.The drawings are very cute and clear; it is a nice tool to start teaching different animals, concepts and relationships.The colors are awesome, very bright and stimulating; every page has a contrasting graphic and background color.I love Sassy toys, they are always so colorful and have held my DD's interest longer than her other toys.I highly recommend for the smallest bookworm in your life :)Only gripe: These books have only one center page each and I wish that they had 2 or 3 inside since my daughter loves turning book pages.It's excellent.I likethe material too; they are used at that age when everything goes in the mouth.He loves them and so do I!It is quite wonderful.They are shaped perfectly for him to be able to pick up easily and chew on--which he never tires of.Highly recommend.It is a very engaging, fun toy for him.But then I opened it up to see about changing the battery.So we took that part off completely.He does enjoy spinning it and flipping the little pieces around.I agree with another reviewer that the music can be annoying and go off without so much as a tiny bump or nudge (NOT good when your little one is sleeping in the stroller!).I saw this item for sale some where on the web for almost $50 and I have no idea why!Here, the item was inexpensive.We take it with us to a restaurant to keep baby entertained.One thing to note, only the round pink ball illuminates.This car will go FOREVER depending on how far you wind it back and how much free space you give it.Lots of fun.My 9 month old received this for Christmas and it's a huge hit with both my 9 month old and my 3yr old.Not too noisy (unlike the larger popper vacuum thingies), just enough noise to keep his attention.It is small enough, about 5-6 inches for small hands to manipulate.Kids love the "popcorn popper" push toy-- it's a classic.This is a nice, sturdy toy.My son has a terrible gag reflex, wrong texture, too much in his mouth, tickle in his throat, all of his food is coming up and this bib catches ALL of it!It's terrific!Highly, VERY highly recommended!Just received the item, didn't get to use it yet, but it looks very well made, and my daughter loves the design!It is very wide and catches liquid and everything else.The back does start to get funky but after using it for a long time (we probably had it close to a year).Although I do wash it carefully by trying to not get the back wet.This mattress was definitely worth the extra $$I love that it has 2 sides, my daughter is 19 months old so we have only used the toddler side but I have no hesitations that the baby side would be just as good.Non-toxic, cute, easy to grasp, fun to mouth on, and clanks when she rattles it.Great for entertaining her in the car seat.My son instantly loved this.He is 6 months and everything goes in his mouth so he chews on the ring as well as the keys.My son (5 months) LOVES this baby toy.He plays it for a long time and 2 months later he still likes it.The only complain I have is I wish the color isn't so "girly" as I have a baby boy..!I bought these nipples only because they're advertised as allowing to interchange between a bottle and breastfeeding.And for my 2 months old breastfed baby the slow flow is just perfect.Our breastfed baby rejected the silicone Nuk stage 1 nipple, but really liked the latex Nuk stage 1 nipple, which had a slower flow and softer (more breast-like) texture and consistency than the silicone version.The latex version would be ideal for breastfed infants with a strong suck.I orignally bought these as a 'liner' on top of my changing pad.These work great.If you are out and about, changing your child's diaper and no mishaps happen in the process these can be folded up and used again.Only the plastic back touches outer surfaces... the patterned part is what touches your baby.I love these!They are sturdy enough to use again and again.I bought both sizes, smaller for diaper bag and larger ones for table at home.Baby has peed on them and it did not go through (but it did go off the edge a few times).These are nice sturdy cups at a decent price, you can't go wrong with these.My son loves these.He has lots of fun with them in the tub.My 11 month old son loves the Green Sprouts Stacking Cup set.Another fun aspect of these cups, besides the nesting factor, is that if you turn them upside down, you can stack them up and build a tower.My son, 11 mos, loves these little cups!They are BPA-free which is nice compared with other stacking cups.As I'm learning and these cups taught me, sometimes the simplest toys are the best.They are small like other reviewers state.They work awesome in the bathroom for a bathtub toy that is fun to play with and organic.My child loves them and can't get enough use out of them!They are lasting very well for us!He loves using these toys as a stacking cups as well and easily stack up very well.my little one is 7 months and loves playing with and teething on these cups.He absolutely LOVES these cups!He can grasp a cup in each little hand, then drop them and pick up another color when it catches his eye.We've also used them in the tub, the float and have tiny holes in fun shapes on the bottom.Our daughter has always loved the bath.Simple?Fantastic?we gotta watch that in the tub!).I read everyone's reviews before purchasing this for my then 5 month old grandaughter-  she LOVES them.When my other granddaughter becomes 5 months I most likely will buy her a set,too.I bought these particular stacking cups because the lips are rounded, the colors are engaging (not EVERYTHING has to be primary colors), and they didn't look cheap like so many stacking sets do.Very pleased.i love these cups.overall, minus the anti-stacking feature they are worth the purchase.i bought this for our baby on the way, but my just turned 2 year old loves them!love the colors and different sizes and i can show him how to match up the colors and stack in order.These cups are great for the tub.But I wish the colors are less "pink  and peach"!!- I have a baby boy and it's kind of silly when we have playdates, all the girls want to grab his stacking cup set.They need to make the colors more "boy friendly".Quite a few people seem to be complaining that these nesting cups don't stack.Well they do stack, it's just that it's not very easy to stack b/c of the narrow lip on the bottoms of the cups that people complain about.The colors are also not very exciting.My 8 month old will play w/these for awhile but prefer to play w/our real cups more.Maybe she'll grow into them when she learns to play in sand & water.It can twist and bend into shape and while it is relatively big in size, it is lightweight and fits into her little hands.I'd prefer brights over pastels personally, but perhaps its the eco-friendly materials they use that limit the dye colors.My son (5 months) LOVES this baby toy.However from four months on, he loves it and it really does entertain him.Nice rattle sound.My baby loves to play with it.But it's great as a rattle.Colors are very pleasing.Agree with the other reviews -- this is a great non-toxic rattle for parents looking to give their little ones something safe to teeth/mouth on.My 7-month-old is at the stage where everything goes straight to her mouth, so this is a great option.We got it recently, but I think she would have enjoyed it as a younger infant as well.It's easy to rattle, she enjoys the different textures, and I like that it's safe for her mouth and easy to clean -- it's a hit!My son loves this!I love that it's safe AND fun!Great buy and great peace of mind!I purchased this teething ring for my son because it is made of safe plastics, and is filled with water.I wish the teething ring were more colorful, to keep my little one's interest, but I understand that to do so, it would most likely sacrifice the integrity of this product (i.e.I really appreciate that its simply filled with water.The only draw back is my 6 month seems to be bored by it, and usually bypasses this for a more colorful option.If this were available in colors it would be perfect!My baby is teething and she loves this ring.She loves it and will munch on it for a while.I bought this before our son really started teething.I had expected it to be more pliable like ones I had seen when I was a teenage babysitter.It's a bit thicker than what a 6-month old can grasp or put in the mouth depending on how skilled they are.In general, teething rings aren't a big hit with our son.My son likes it, and it is a great goto teether.It's made in China which i didn't expect (and was a disappoint).It survived to be chewed another day :)It does the job for $4 though.And then they had fun for the next 20 minutes sticking it... in my mouth.Because it's thin, it is easy to fold, and due to the size, I found it too small to be safely given to the baby.My daughter wasn't too interested in these at first (around 4 months), but once she got the coordination down to get it in her mouth successfully, it quickly became her favorite teether!Great safe buy!When I got these I was unimpressed at there size and shape.I was also unhappy they were made in China.But they are actually my son's favorite cold teether.Plus, cute colors and modern design.They all seem really sturdy and well-designed.We loved it so much we bought a second bowl (the orange/white one), and were surprised to get an orange/blue bowl!Our now 1 year old son can easily hold this slimmer duck in his hand.The negative is that he is not as attracted to this one as much as he is to the fatter orange & white one.I think because, eventhough to me this one is cuter, for him it might be the contrast of the other one that gets his attention.I bought Odd Duck Jane a couple of months back, she was the extra $5 I needed to spend to get free shipping on an order, and I was intrigued by the idea of a bath duck that didn't contain PVC.Jane measures about 4" long, has a weighted bottom so she will float nicely in water, and is even able upright herself if she is knocked over.These ducks will always right themselves if tipped, and thus never float on their backs.Bob(orange) tends to float with his bill in the air, at a slight backward angle, and Squish (yellow) floats with his bill toward the water, at a slight forward angle.Both Bob and Squish can be upended, but Bob will most often right himself.With Squish it takes a bit more activity to upend him, but once he tips over, he's a back-floater.2.I'm confused, however, as to how some people's ducks filled with water underneath, as Bob's underside is still sealed.Nonetheless, Bob only floats on his back when he is minus-the-disk, so we wrote Boon and sent them a photo of our defective Bob (after all, my three-year old had actually done chores to earn money for Bob, and he's not cheap for a little duck).Boon's response was prompt, friendly, apologetic -- and three days later a new duck arrived on our doorstep.Document it, and send it to Boon.Unlike a company(ex.I bought this for my daughter when she was a year old and she loves it!It floats very well and she likes chewing the beak and playing with it in the bath.Fun alternative to the typical rubber duckies.That brought us to Boon and to Bob and Squish the duckies.We love them and so does my daughter.They both float well and neither of them have taken on any water.We do, however, make sure to remove them from the tub after every bath.I love the teether keys from Greensprout so I was hoping to love this one too.The velcro that holds the teething ring is already coming off- and we just received it.The cloth, knots and teether are small enough that my 4-month old son has no problem holding it and chewing on it.Plus it's organic so I'm more comfortable with it.For the price it's worth it!I have struggled with nipple pain for most of my nursing experience on and off.highly recommend!!When I first started breastfeeding it was a nightmare.They fit fine (yes, the extra insert seemed a bit long at first) but it was absorbent and kept everything in.This is not good for newborns who still have their umbilical cord stumps, so I waited until after the stump had fallen off before using it.The company said to fold the soaker down, but the front still would have covered her stump.Anyway, the soaker would be almost an inch thick and likely to be uncomfortable for the baby, so I just use the diaper with it sticking out.Also, I think it is strange that the soaker pad consists of two layers, the curvy smooth layer and the straight fuzzy layer.I absolutely LOVE the cover of the Gro Baby's - the velcro isn't scratchy and it is really trim at the hips.However, I have little use for the snap-in soakers (my husband loves them, but mostly because it is simple).BUT, I often lay in a prefold and find that (since it goes all the way to the edges, unlike the soakers) it works much better.The soaker is not very soft and tends to rub him a little raw when he is especially active.The soaker does not wick away moisture at all.The diapers are now much more comfortable and not as bulky.If I use them for my son, I use a different brand's soaker pad and things work fine.I have several of these and have 3 inserts for each shell.What I love about this diaper:1.There are lots of bright, attractive colors and patterns.We have "boy" and "girl" patterns.I love them all!2.The tabs are not scratchy and won't irritate baby's skin.They're almost smooth to the touch!3.Perfect laundry tabs.Overlapping tabs.The elastic helps, but if the baby poops, chances are we are going to have to rinse and change the shell.With other AIO systems, we can make it through a day with 2 shells.2.Taller rise.At 15 months old, she is totally unsnapped, so the rise will not go any higher for her.These were the first we had to go up in size every time she grew, also.3.Very functional, but you might need a few shells more than other AIO systems.Compared to fleece (Fuzzibunz, Bumgenius), these soakers absorb more and are less prone to leak (just make sure you prep them before using as directed).The soaker pads are easy to put on the cover and reduce the amount of material to wash due to their trim size.Now I have to make sure I wash them as soon as possible.And I don't want to wash them by hand.We have used BumGenius, Thirsties, gDiapers, Kushies, and GroBaby and the GroBaby takes the cake for shell / soaker systems.gro baby and gdiapers are our diaper of choice.I bought this night light for my almost 2 yr old son.It can be switched between three solid colors (red, blue, or green) or what we call 'rainbow' where it changes from red, organge, yellow, green, blue, and purple...really pretty.SInce the light doesn't get hot I give it to my son to hold in bed with him and have taught him how to turn it back on by pushing the little black button on the bottom.I haven't had anything break on me and like I said, my son carries it around and plays with it.I also imagine that a baby could bury her face in the side of the sling and suffocate that way.I am using this with my 2 month old daughter, and I do not feel that I am endangering my child at all with this sling because I am extremely observant of her and I am confident in my ability to ensure that she is comfortable and breathing easily.I am also very careful about her position, ensuring that she is not going to have any difficulty breathing.With small babies, you ALWAYS need to make sure that their airways are clear and that they are not in a dangerous position and you need to be very observant and aware of them at all times.I don't need it yet, but it may come in handy when she starts moving around more.It isn't soft like a baby blanket but it does feel comfortable and cushy.I search all over for a mobile for my son who loves anything that flies.This fit the bill it looks just like the picture, brightly colored and just the right size I have it handing over his breakfast table he just loves it.I have a 4 month old boy and he loves all of his toys, however this is the hardest one for him to use.Easy and light weight for my son to hold and wonderful served cold for sore gums.It has a good ring to grip, stays cool a while, and has great textures to chew on.The colors and the texture keep her entertained.This teether is adorable.It has a jelly part which my 3 month old son really enjoys.The colors are also very nice and can be held comfortably by baby!I bought this little teether bug for my son for xmas when he was 5 months old, and he loved it.Even now at almost 10 months old he still chews on it and carries it around with with him.My daughter LOVES these keys!They are beautiful colors, make satisfying noises, and she loves to chew and shake them.They were a bit larger than I expected, and the "keychain" part with the black and white stripes is a little heavy.It also says hello and goodbye in English and Spanish.They are perfect for his little hands & easy to bring to his mouth & chew on since that's all he wants to do anyway.Mucn nicer made than I expected, especially for the great price.Beautiful bright colors and textures, each one is a little different textured (nice for a teething baby who chews everything).The links come off fairly easily, so  they are nice for clipping things to the car seat and stroller, but I esp.Feel it was not just a fun buy, but a smart investment.The colored links are fine enough, though the texture prevents many toys with loops from fitting on the links.The large black and white link opens too easily and detaches from other links.Very basic toy, but my daughter loves these links.She loves to put them in her mouth, grasp them and shake them.I can make a chain to string across his seat, turn it back into a rattle, use a few links to put other dangling toys into reach... At 3.5 months he grabbed it, then started to chew it, and now at 5 months he can pull the links off for a great gnaw.Clear, bright colors and interesting textures make this even more attractive.I used a lot of Sassy toys with my kids when they were young so the name as a brand carries a lot of weight with me.The rings are very colorful and have a variety of textures.The holder ring has a great knobby ball for grabbing and chewing.All are safe for little mouths and easy to wash off.It makes a great baby gift that will last from infancy to toddler teething.LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THESE!!They are awesome.I also have some of the First Years links and they tend to come apart easily, these Sassy ones are sturdy and don't come apart.They are a must for any parent!This is essentially a few basic links on a nicer black and white link.Just buy the 24 pack of links from Bright Starts.When my son was 4 months and under, he didnt love these.When baby gets oldler they are great for teething and playing.Around 12 months of age, they can start linking them themselves for a great fine motor skill game.Then when they are toddling around, you can use them to link cabinets together to prevent babies from opening them.Such a cheap must have item.Highly recommend!My 7 month old loves rings.I bought this and the other Sassy Ring toy.This one is simply awesome.So many ways you can use the links and perfect for my baby's hands & mouth.We bought these for our 5 month old daughter and she loves them!Our little girl loves these butterfly teethers better than any other water filled teether we've purchased.I wish we would have bought two packs!Love them!I purchased these links for my son at around age 4-5 months.He's loved them ever since, even now at 11 months.They are a top 2 or 3 favorite amongst all of his toys.The different colors and textures are great, although I do wish there was a little more variety in my batch - I seem to have gotten a lot of plain orange letters.They link together easily, but as one reviewer mentioned, some of the openings (the "J" and "D") are large, and links can come apart and fly across the room or car.As another reviewer mentioned, the shapes are not consistent - some are outlines, while some are actual letters.That being said, I would get them again and again for my son.They provide him hours of entertainment and help develop his fine motor skills.As links, some of them (B, S, D in particular) open easily and detach from other links.As letters, the depictions are too varied.these links are much more interesting than regular links.they offer a variety of textures and are easy for my 4 1/2 mo's fingers to catch.he's starting to put everything in his mouth and these offer a variety of shapes, sizes and textures and are easy to clean.plus the price is right.some of the openings are wide, but some work great with regular links... i kept the wide ones like S and Q for tummy time.The colors and patterns are great.I bought them anyway, still use them and love them.My 9 month old baby boy loves his links.He likes to teeth on these, as they have different textures.He is always playing with the links, each day he has some shaking them around, chewing on them, and pulling them apart.I like these link is particular because they are safe for teething, the colors are bright and not painted, so they don't chip or flake, also it's a good value.You get 26 alphabet links.fairly inexpensive, and the kids just loves it!I bought this rattle not long after my son was born.Once they get to be around 4-7 months though they will love it.Love this sleepsack.my son didn't start enjoying this until he was a little older, maybe 7 or 8 months.They are a little thinner then I hoped for but they wash the babyLove these towels and wash cloths.I had received some carter's wash cloths - which were a cotton/polyester mix - and let's just say they were rough.You don't want to give your baby a bath with some rough wash cloths.Love them and my son loves taking baths!They do a good job of absorbing the water and I like the hooded part for baby's head.I think these are pretty soft.They are not as soft as a really high quality towel but again the cost is very reasonable.I find the washcloths a little too rough for baby's skin, though I didn't really purchase the set for the cloths.Overall, a good purchase.This towel is very nice, I like that it has a good quality to it, and the washcloths are nice too.The frog embroidery is cute wich is the one my baby owns, this set is great as a gift for a baby shower too.I love these.LOVE THEM!!!These are great for cleaning baby's bottom - use a wipe to get the major stuff, then use these washcloths (soaked in warm water and wrung out) to get the detailed work done.Terrific.I purchased two more packs to make sure I have enough on hand.Well worth it for my use!Highly recommended for this use!10 of them in the pack, which is great, I never run out, even when I use 2 washcloths at a time.one to put on the baby's tummy to keep her warm and the other one to wash her.and have 2 sides - 1 terry side and the back is soft/jersey-ish which i use for the face.It's always good to have extra washcloths for new babies, as they do soil themselves very often.I like that the material is very soft and washes well.You can also use this as burp cloth and a blanket to lay your baby in.For the price, it is worth it.I would prefer for it to be bigger so as to accommodate growing infant better.These blankets are very nice but I usually only use them for burp cloths.Although they both have the curvature on top, I prefer the Bebe Au Lait one because the material is a tiny bit thicker and it has the nice pockets inside it.The boning in it for seeing my DD is essential.The only thing I might change is to make it a little bit longer on the sides and maybe an option for attaching in the back to prevent the side view when nursing.This was recommended to me by a friend.When I new to nursing, I liked to use it because it was so big, I felt very covered up and more comfortable that way.I do like this one in particular, but I think it stands out more than a solid color would.I just use a blanket now most of the time, or I use this and just don't put it over my neck.My baby is two months old and the Hooter Hider is perfect for nursing in public!It has a built-in frame at the top to keep the fabric out from your body a bit so you can see your baby and this really helps with getting baby latched on properly.That way I can leave the house knowing that if my baby is hungry when we are out and about, I can feed her anytime, anywhere.I love the Marseille pattern - very pretty and feminine.They do work well.This one is a bit stiffer than he bummis at first, but once it's all sweaty/wet, it seems about the same.$180 pluming bill!I bought it to bring to the beach to shade my 3 month old son from the sun.The clipping mechanism, if opened wide enough to fit around parts of my stroller would fall apart.I would then be scrambling on the ground to pick up little nuts and washers while my son baked so I could screw the darn thing back together and try again!In addition to it being not very easy to clip, the umbrella itself is very small.I ended up carrying it by hand and holding it over the baby when he was in the bjorn.I am going to return the umbrella tomorrow.I bought this shade for travel to a hot and sunny climate and I was really disappointed by its performance.I keep tightening the umbrella, but it keeps moving and falling.I even had my husband tighten it and it kept falling.I received the Sleepy Wrap as a baby shower gift, and it has proven itself to be a fantastic product.He either looks around happily or sleeps peacefully.There is no external pressure on his head, so it's much better than laying him in a swing, bouncer or crib.I can even breastfeed my son in the Wrap.We also have a Baby Bjorn, which my husband often wears, and he prefers the Sleepy Wrap for both his and baby's comfort.The only con of the Sleepy Wrap is that it takes practice to put it on just right, but after about a dozen times it becomes second nature.Also, as I mentioned above, I do have to reposition him to nurse, which often leaves the Wrap stretched and I have to re-wrap it in order to get the snug fit I desire.I don't buy anything from China at all, regardless of how "responsibly" it has been made.I wish to protect my family as well as American jobs.These cups are really cute, but they are just too small.I have a six month old and have been looking for a non-plastic food storage option.You can freeze in these (they create a seal), warm food up, light for travel, and throw in the dishwasher.The serving size is perfect for a baby.These flexible cups are large enough for little hands, belonging to those with developing dexterity, to hold comfortably.The size allows the cup to be only partially filled while still providing more than just a sip of liquid.Beware filling these cups too full - because they are flexible, little explorers will want to see what happens if they push their hands together while holding the cup!These cups can be used to demonstrate "in" and "out" as one drops a ball in the cup and encourages the child to remove the ball.Couldn't find info about size of the jars before buying, so there it is: Jars size is 100 ml or 3.5 oz.The jars are nice and sturdy, seem to close well.I bought these bowls for my seven-month-old daughter and am very happy with the purchase.Although they are flexible, they seem to be sturdy and unlikely to slip on a high chair tray.The most important thing is that I don't have to worry about chemicals getting into her food.These cups are great (Amy Coe makes similar cups that do come with lids also) but they are great for little hands and are very light and flexible.I highly recommend these cups to parents who would rather teach their children how to drink from a regular cup than a sippy.It is like the "holy grail" of kid dishes.These bowls are perfect for feeding that little one, right?The portion is just right, the colors are fun, and they clean up easily.I bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months old and started using her exersaucer.The blanket certainly didn't provide that.The HuggaBebe is very soft and thick.She always has this smile on her face when we put it on.I think every parent should have one of these.In this, she was so comfortable and supported.Well made and washes well.This is the perfect solution for our daughter who wants to be in her exersaucer and activity centers but is still a little small and wobbly.This provides the additional support in a comfortable manner.I recommend this highly!I am so happy with this wonderful product!Several people that have seen my baby in it have asked where they could find one...this is definitely worth the $$$!as another reviewer pointed out, the tub arrived without a drain hose.the replacement tub had no hose either, so amazon credit me full amount back, and i got to keep the tub.it'd be more convenient with the hose, but without it it's ok too.this was the tub of my choice because it is the only one on the market (to my knowledge) that comes with a stand which allows access to the baby from both sides (my husband and i bathe our daughter together), though i wish the stand was a bit taller.For the first 4 months of his life, this was my son's bed.Could NOT be more pleased!He slept in it until he really started rolling over and did not want to be contained by the buckle anymore, and then we put him in a crib.I've tried bumping it from every angle, and other than a nice gentle rocking nothing happens.As for that rocking, if our son stirred in his sleep he would create that gentle movement and it would usually lull him back to sleep.However, the person who bought this for us from our registry was a smoker and it came to us reeking of smoke.After that I only needed to wash the top part when he spit up or peed in it.But it was nice to know I could wash the whole thing!His head is perfectly round now...so I'd highly recommend using this in conjunction with the Noggin Nest if you need to!We got this bed as a gift and considered taking it back because we thought we would only use it for the first few months but my son is 11 months old and we still use it when he has a cold and he loves to sleep in it.It is also very easy to take with us even in our Honda Civic Hybrid (small trunk).I love this little rocker.It is very lightweight and portable and the incline is perfect for my reflux cursed newborn.I do wish it had a vibration feature of some automatic rocking button (but the simplicity I am sure keeps the price low)All in all, I am happy with this purchase, but would not say it is a must have.We bought this for our daughter before she was born, so this is the only thing she has ever slept in, besides the cribs at her daycare.Her head is still perfectly round (no flat spots) and has perfect neck/shoulder movement.It travels easily, and is often in and out of the car, since we visit my parents at least 3x a week.We were hoping she would sleep in the bassinet part of our play-yard, but that was not working for us.We couldn't get the right elevation and I think the space was still too open for her to feel comfortable.She was elevated and the design seemed to make her feel snug and safe.It was such a relief!The cradle is also the perfect bedside height.I can pull the cradle closer or push it away to get out of bed without disturbing my daughter.She's about 14lbs and 25in right now and still fits comfortably in the cradle.However, she is fast outgrowing it so we're hoping to transition to the crib soon.This cradle travels well too.It's been to my parents and my in-laws several times for weekend visits.The "legs" also disassemble easily if you need to package it into an even smaller space.I bought it after my baby came prematurely and had reflux issues.He is also a little colicky and the sleeper seems to do nothing to soothe either issue.I love the height though.While researching supports and wedges to help her stay upright, thank goodness this little gem popped up.The best parts about it are the mesh panels along the sides.These allow me to not panic that she will turn her head and have her face up against something non-breathable The seat is deep, so there isn't much worry about the baby being able to lean up and flop out.It folds up easily to take to grandma's house or a babysitter's house and gives the baby somewhere safe to sleep without having to transport a pack-n-play.I put her in the kitchen while I'm washing dishes or in the living room next to the couch .The angle of the seat is great and comfortable for baby, like his own little hammock.I love the height of it and portability.This is much more cost effective than those expensive co-sleepers.PLEASE READ:I loved this at first, but am kicking myself now for using it so much!I have a small house so the size of this was perfect--no large pack n play to have to move around and fit into a small space.I can't tell you how much I regret using this rocker.The crib was just too much space for her and she would scream her head off the second you put her down.This rocker is incredibly easy to move from room to room, not to mention fold up and take along to family or friends.It was just what my daughter needed before the transition to the crib.I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law and I wish I had used one of these when I had my babies.The fabric is very soft and supportive.We used it until she was almost 6 months old and it was indispensable!My son (2 1/2 months old) doesn't sleep much in this, but it is great to use when I need to get some work done at the computer or want to eat at the dining table.It folds up easily and compactly and I found out that the mobile (non-electric) from our pack and play (baby trend brand) fits perfectly on the side of the rock and play sleeper which he loves to watch.Also he has a bit of reflux and it seems to help out especially those times when I just can't get him to burp; keeping him upright helps a lot.It is super easy to assemble and nice neutral fabric color.My baby slept in this when we brought her home and it was great.We won this item in a raffle when our son was already 7 months old.Our son is currently about 18-19 lbs., but I'm certain we will be able to get some good use out of it before he hits the weight limit of 25 lbs.(just like this item), but our son was outgrowing it lengthwise and had starting sitting up more and moving so that it was unsafe to operate the motor.I had considered giving this item away because I thought he would be too big for it, but not so.Our baby fits great and, what's more, he really seems to like napping in it.The baby is fairly deep in the sleeper, so I do not fear him falling out when I am moving him across the floor.If he is awake, I can keep him close by, and he is comforted by being able to see and/or hear me.Since our baby is used to it, I think it helped him adapt to being in an unfamiliar place.This is a great item - very sturdy, simple, comfortable, portable, and a great price !Highly, highly recommended.I had a C-section and knew I wanted something easy at my bedside when we got home.The Newborn Rock n' Play is perfect for those early days because it is at or below the bed height.After that, we used it in the living room for cat naps and quiet play.We brought it for a daytrip to relatives for the holidays and it was perfect for keeping baby safe and close to the action, and was easily moved to a quiet room for nap time.This is something I will give for baby showers....Returning now when baby is 5 months old to say that this napper is still a huge help in our household.We still use it as the multipurpose chill out, sleep, play piece when we visit friends for the day.Well, I do not have much to say that has not already been said.I bought this before baby was born in my quest to find better sleep.Dh thought I was a little nuts, but I figured if just ONE worked, it would not matter.Wouldn't you know, this one .I was EXHAUSTED holding her literally all day and the first few times she did not react well.This is great, and reasonably priced.Great reclining position, rocks if he fusses, portable.This sleeper is wonderful.Although it is lightweight, this sleeper is also quite steady and does not tip over easily.The baby appears to be in a comfortable and safe position in it.It rocks gently when baby is kicking/moving.When we brought him home, I felt like he was too tiny for this thing.Once he kind of started sleeping in it, he started breathing really funny in his deep sleep stage.This is a great item.Its very light-weight which make it easy to carry on trips etc.Wish there was a variety of colors.Maybe $15....either way my 3-year-old loved it.His only complaint was that Muno's arms are sewed down to his sides, so Muno can't "wave".The stitching for the eye and mouth is good and sturdy.We love our stroller (a Combi Cosmo) but it didn't come with a cupholder.It attaches easily and fits great.It's also great for storing other items.They might cost twice as much but they last forever.And I can position them lower on my Bob handlebars which helps to keep my stroller from tipping.LOVE LOVE LOVE these.Its a great stroller.The only reason that I have given it five stars, is because of the basket underneath.It is a decent size, but really not easy to get to.The ease of use and lightweight more than make up for it.I've owned this stroller for two years now...Pros: lightweight, amazingly easy fold, good steering, best canopy on the marketCons: We live in the city with lots of cobblestones and uneven pavement and the tires and suspension are just not very smooth as your child gets heavier.Wish I had purchased the City Elite or Bob Revolution with larger inflatable tires and better suspension.As a sidenote, BJ customer service has been awesome.Okay, I love this stroller!It's not perfect, but for someone (like me) living in a small apartment in a walk-up building, and using it on all kinds of city streets, it is just about as good as it gets.Let me start by saying that my baby is 16 months old and, for the last year, we have been using a lightweight, full-featured umbrella stroller.That stroller is a great stroller, no question about it, but for our needs .the City Mini is just better.It started when I noticed my upstairs neighbor taking her City Mini, and her baby, up and down our stairs with relative ease.Though I had always been happy with our stroller, I couldn't help but notice that hers seemed easier.And after a few weeks, I finally splurged and bought the City Mini myself, even though I had sworn to my husband and myself that I'd never buy another stroller.I do not regret it one bit, because:1.I can do it easily while holding my baby and then carry both him and the stroller up the stairs.Even though the City Mini, is quite a bit heavier than my 11 lb.With the umbrella stroller, I had to bend to fold it, and then it was just more awkward/bulky to carry, even with the carry-strap.It ended up taking more energy even though it was lighter.The City Mini sunshade canopy is great.It goes from big to bigger and has two peek-a-boo windows, which I love.It is SO easy to steer and push.I thought my umbrella stroller had a smooth ride (and it does, compared to other umbrellas), but the City Mini blows it out of the water.(This feature is what made my husband, who thought I was insane for buying another stroller, decide that I had been right after all.He couldn't deny how much smoother the ride was.)4.I'm fairly tall, and I don't kick the back when I walk.That was a problem with many of the strollers I had tried in the store (though, to its credit, the umbrella stroller I finally bought - the UppaBaby G-Luxe -- is also perfect for tall parents).5.Naptime, anyone?Now, as I said, the City Mini is not perfect.There's no such thing as a perfect stroller.My complaints?The seat back is not as supportive as I would like, and my baby slouches in it more than he did in the other stroller.The City Mini storage basket is fairly large but a little bit hard to access (not impossible - just not quite as easy as some other strollers).The first time I took my City Mini on the subway and had to prop it against the wall while I bought a Metrocard, the concrete scuffed the handlebar.Not cool.Nevertheless, when you factor in the wonderful sunshade, the fantastic maneuveribility, and the incredible one-handed fold, the above complaints fade the background -- the City Mini still takes the cake.If you are a city-dweller like me and debating between a City Mini and an umbrella stroller (like UppaBaby G-luxe or Maclaren), I hope you find this review particularly useful.Still, all things considered, I wish I had bought the City Mini first.Update:Only Cons:1) Stroller is not as smooth to stroll as I had imagined.It twirls and tangles a bit so it takes a while.6) I like it but, to me, I think it's just a tad better than an umbrella stroller.Like the Mac Quest which is lighter and more compact.7) Parent cupholders - you have to buy everything separately.Don't get fooled by the starting price...------I just received the stroller in Crimson/Gray today.It was a cinch to put together and all the parts in the stroller makes sense.I'll post an update then.However, everything including the color looks great!Love it and highly recommend.And I bought it off another site, [...].They offer a $5 return if you are dissatisfied.It's good insurance for purchasing online.Our little girl is now 15 months old, so we have been using our City Mini for a while.Folding and unfolding is AMAZING!!!Just pick it up with one hand, and have your baby in the other hand, WOW!!!Folds super small.Great option when I pick her up from daycare, and my hubby had dropped her off.Even the gate agents were amazed at how easily it folded.We have taken to our dog park through dirt, mud and grass and it is just wonderful.I do recommend that you also purchase the parent tray, and I wish that Baby Jogger included it.I also purchased an JJ Cole Urban BundleMe, that works great.Gee, I wish I had such a nice snuggly ride!We just love this stroller!and this stroller is a dream!It turns so easily - it's really easy to push and gives a smooth ride!You won't regret getting this stroller.This is the fourth stroller I own and it will be the last!I wish when I was pregnant I knew someone that had this stroller, as we bought a travel system (first time parents) and thought that was the best purchase.This is perfect!We do own a Jeep jogger that is great for trips to the beach and big days out where we need the storage.I recommend this to all parents!I did months of research trying to find just the right stroller for my daughter.With my 2 older boys, I owned numerous strollers and had problems with all of them.Baby is 7 months and quite comfortable in the seat.One con: it did take some time and patience to get the harness straps adjusted properly.I love the big adjustable canopy; it does a wonderful job of covering baby's face adequately.The tires are big and offer a smooth ride.It's easy to push and maneuver.We got the green and gray model and it is a very pleasing color combination.We also purchased the child tray and parent console separately.The parent console even offers a small insulated compartment; how handy!I did a TON of research before purchasing this and it's lived up to my expectations.I needed...- Lightweight for extensive air travel & because I'm only 5ft tall- Easy to fold and carry because I am often by myself with the baby- Fully reclining because my baby sleeps in the stroller- Reinforced back because I hate flimsy backs where the baby slumps down- Excellent coverage for hot weather & rain/freezing weather- Sensitive maneuverabilityThis stroller had it all!The strap used to fold the stroller ends up on top so you don't have to grab anything else to transport it once you close it.I'm only 5ft tall and I can maneuver this in an out of the car and through baggage claim with ease all by myself.We travel is very sunny climates so this extra large sunshade is perfect.Everything you can think of to keep your baby at a comfortable temperature has been addressed with this stroller.When the baby is reclined on a hot day, you can keep the back cover rolled tightly up so the screen is exposed and air can vent through.It looks just as nice as the BOB or Peg Perego but SO much cheaper and lighter.I had a Maclaren, which is great for travel (umbrella fold) but it is just too tipsy with not enough storage for everyday use.I also have a Bob Revolution because we are true joggers, but it is just too big and heavy for everyday use.You won't find a canopy like this anywhere, and it is so stable it would take a lot to tip it over.The price is great for the quality.It is a perfect fix.In the summer the large canopy has been great to shade our 11 month old from the sun.Lastly, since we live in Washington-- the canopy has been priceless to fend off the rain.There are a number of positives to this stroller:+ Compact (it fits in the back of my Mini Clubman with the rear wheels popped off)+ Ease of folding (just pull the strap)+ Ease of removing the wheels (one button)+ Big canopy+ Large windows in the canopy+ Tall handle (easier on my back than the Graco we have)+ Good ride (not close to the ride of the old English pram we used when she was young, but better than the Graco)+ Accessories (we haveBaby Jogger Child Tray, there are others available)+ Weight+ Turns on a dime+ Easy reclining (one hand)Some things that are adequate:= Decent storage space (not fantastic, no hanging bags from it)= Wheels size (could be bigger but not a big problem)= Wheel construction (solid EVA, inflatables would be a positive upgrade)= Reclined position (goes almost flat)And only a few negatives- Five point harness is overly restrictive for a walking stroller (and this is definitely a walking stroller not a jogging stroller).Since providing a seat is one of the core attributes of a stroller, it is worth noting.We mostly use the Graco around the neighborhood even though it is clunkier just because she is more comfortable.I love this stroller!I bought this stroller after seeing a video review on here from Baby Gizmo (the link to the City Mini that I had purchased along with all that feedback/reviews is gone off of Amazon now, so if you want to see that video review, just google it).I love the ease of this stroller.I like that you can easily fold it with one hand while holding your child (or anything) in your other hand.It folds up smaller that most "full size" strollers, and I do consider this one to be a full size stroller because it has all the perks of it.We got our City Mini specifically for a trip to Tokyo with our 38 inch 3 1/2 yr old.in the Tokyo subway system.Our child was incredibly comfortable and I think sees this stroller as more of a "big kid" ride than her previous stroller.Canopy coverage is really deluxe - provides excellent shade and also maximum privacy if your child just wants to check out.as you walk down the street.As to durability: Our "gate checked" stroller was put into checked bagagge on the Japan end on our return flight to the US and it came out unscathed!!!The stroller was completely intact!!!!)I wish we had bought this stroller much, much earlier.I'm looking forward to using it on more vacations and for neighborhood walks, and I would recommend it without hestitation.We absolutely love this stroller.This stroller is excellent.I read all the reviews after one person said they found out how to truly lock the stroller in the folded position.Still 5 stars for us for holding up as our ONLY stroller.Worth it and so sleek!The ERGO carrier is so comfortable and I carry my son in it for hours.I also bought the infant insert, the sucking pads and the pouch.The insert is good if your baby is on the smaller side as it helps boost them up, the sucking pads are great so you don't get the straps all dirty.I bought this for my sister who is expecting in December.My husband carries my toddler in the black one on his back and I carry my son in the front with the brown one.We are able to walk the beach with both kids in their Ergos.It's pricey, but oh so worth it!!!I had to buy this one for my sister and was super happy when I found it on her registry.My black carrier has the white sucking pads and they really stand out against the black straps.The Ergo + insert combo couldn't be more comfortable and secure to wear, and I can get into and out of it myself.One drawback (and I consider it significant) is that having a separate insert makes it very difficult to change a diaper when away from home.You first have to take the baby + insert out of the Ergo, then find some place to put the insert while changing the diaper (I balance it between my knees so it doesn't fall to the floor) and then get the whole production together again while in a cramped, dirty bathroom.My son is 2 months old and when I put him in the insert, he was too big for it so I just use the cushion to boost him up higher so that he is where I want him in the carrier.The ergobaby seems like it will be great for when my son gets older, but this infant insert just doesn't make any sense.My son is squished and hot.If he leans forward he is right under my chin so I can't look around and I'm afraid he can't breathe.I'm not afraid to go out to the store anymore because I know that I can just put him in the insert and he'll calm down when we walk around.It was a little warm - but when we are at home I just leave him in his onesie and I wear a light cotton shirt.I tried using both a Snugli and Bjorn and my son cried when I put him in them.My son hated it and seemed too big for it although he was only 3 mths old.I ordered the Heart to Heart and it has been great.My son is very happy in the Ergo and loves to look around or take a nap.I also bought the Ergo sucking pads but my son sucks happily on the side of the infant insert so we don't need them right now.It's very secure and he loves it.I love my carrier and this insert helps make the earliest days a bit easier!I bought the insert because I would like to use the Ergo carrier with my newborn daughter, and it was perfect for her!Very easy to use, comfortable, I am very happy with it!My son wasn't happy in there.Once I had the insert, he fit in the ergo perfectly, not just ok.He wasn't sliding around, I didn't have to keep checking his head and moving it into place (the insert kept it from shifting to one side or the other too much), and overall, we were both more comfortable.It seemed bulky and like I could not get my newborn comfortable in it.The baby carrier is easily adjustable and the baby doesn't need to be able to hold her head up to fit snuggly, safely, and comfortably in it.Maybe if someone is very large or very small, or if their baby is very tiny, they might not be able to adjust the carrier with the baby in it as well I am able to, but I don't really think it would be a problem -- just suggesting that it might the reason for other reviewers saying that this is necessary.Aside from being unnecessary, I found this to be too big, bulky, and uncomfortable for use(this is why I decided to see what would happen if I didn't use it, and ended up finding that it wasn't necessary at all).It's perfectWe ordered our Ergo when our son was 2 weeks old and ordered this insert style at the same time.When he was at his tiniest, this was perfect for snugging him right up next to us and keeping him warm (a Winter baby).If I was inside and it was warm, I'd strip him down to a onesie for his own comfort.Now that his legs poke out and it's getting warmer, we've taken the the little butt cushion insert out and use it as a 'booster' so he doesn't sink down all the way and can still get a good look around.Ergo doesn't advertise this secondary use, but it's definitely a great bonus for baby's 'transition' length.I loved it & my baby loved it, too.I wish I had gotten one that's a little more laid back.We'll try again later...So NOW we are using these cups.He is two and they are great.I love Playtex stoppers.A lot of the cups are now integrating the stopper in the mouthpiece but whenever I have washed them in the dishwasher, they seal shut.My cabinet then becomes full and we only have three or four cups we actually use.These are great, worth a try.I like the new insulated sippy cups.My son loves these!I keep it now in the kitchen where she will play with other toys in it while I prep dinner and it is a lifesaver since she is crawling and almost walking.When she was an infant she loved the colors and as soon as she could play she played with each toy almost changing everyday to a new toy, it was a amazing to see her grow with the toy.The colors are bright and the activites are all focused on learning it is great.Her favorites are the piano, the giraffe, and the pandas.I do wish the lion puppet with the drum actually made sound, because my daughter loves to hit drums.Very musical little one.Some parents expressed concerns about how easily it can tip- I see this potential, and that is why I play WITH her as opposed to using it as a baby sitter.These are great gender neutral cups.They are adorable and cute no matter what sex the child is and is not pushing Disney stuff down your throat.Good price and does the job expected.At first he was a little hesitant but once he realized that he controlled the vibrating he likes it.My son LOVES this vibrating teether.All in all its a valuable tool in the arsenal against teething pain and I would absolutely recommend this to others.It's quite easy to strap on, zip up and put the breast shields in.My postpartum bra size was 40F, so I bought the large...kinda wished I had bought the medium.I am now able to make the time spent pumping productive (or at least more enjoyable).Well worth the investment.Bought these for our nursery for our new bundle of joy.They are well made, and have brilliant colors that would stand out against any color background wall.Looking back on my handy work, some of the decals were out of place, so removing them from the wall and reapplying them was a little tricky, i actually tore one slightly while gently removing it from the wall.In conclusion, these look great, and add brightness to the nursery, and would recommend the purchase, just make sure you know where you want them before you start throwing them on the wall!I'm happy that I decided to purchase this decal.It's bright, colorful, cute and it brings an air of cheerfulness to any child's room.I've used it for my baby's dresser and I really am amazed by the exceptional quality.Placement was easy and even the 1 or 2 pieces that had to be adjusted was also easy to remove and reposition.***MAKE SURE YOU READ MY EDIT!***EDIT:One week after reviewing the Lullabelly, I received correspondence from them addressing my issues.Your baby is surrounded by amniotic fluid, which is a very good conductor of sound."- I wasn't aware until purchasing and receiving it that I should only use it in limited bursts, and I still do think that should be somewhere on their website."- This is what they say about the velcro: "Lullabelly should be worn with the sifter "loop" side of the Velcro facing the skin.This will ensure that the softer loop portion is against your skin once extended.The problem is that I "muffin top" over the edges of the belt a little, meaning that my fat bulges out a bit around the back of the belt.The part of the velcro that is bothering my skin is actually the hard edges of BOTH sides, the hook side and the loop side.I'm still not too happy with the discomfort of the velcro, but it's not a huge deal.I think if more companies had customer service like Lullabelly, there would be many more happy customers in the world and fewer negative reviews here on Amazon.I didn't mention this in my original review, but the fabric is very soft and nice feeling on my skin.On that count, it delivers.You will not be a happy camper running through a large airport with this, especially keeping an eye on the children.Unfortunately, it's true.It describes, more or less, the procedure.Unless you've done a few of these, yeah, I'd say be prepared to spend a good 30 min.Go for the cheaper seat and forget about these.* In the rear-facing direction, the straight seat back does extend quite far forward, so you either have to place it in the middle, or hope that whoever sits in the front seat is short.In the middle, our seat is always tilted one way.I think it comes down to the strap that ties down the seat.that is riveted to one side of the seat.We figured out, and the salesperson also said as much, you have to pull it tight in many short jerks.That part we can't figure out since both straps our attached at the same point to the single pull strap...Would I recommend?Otherwise, the rest of the design, manual, ease-of-use, they quite SUCK when compared to the previous Graco that we owned.The only downsides are that it is extremely heavy -- so I wound up just checking it underneath instead of carrying it to the gate and using it on the plane... and that when using it rear facing, it requires that the seat in front of it be moved up.But overall very happy with it and would purchase it again!We have installed it with the seat belt and with the Super Latch, and both ways are quite easy (Super Latch especially).The car seat is definitely sturdy, and I feel reassured knowing my son is in there when we're traveling.We have also used it twice on an airplane with no hassle -- it fit perfectly in the plane seat.Above all, my son (16 months) is so comfortable in the this seat.This is a excellent car seat, very safe, comfortable, and easy to use.Worth the extra weight.I bought this carseat for my son, and I bought one in the reddish-pink flowers for my daughter.What I loved about this seat is that it's very hefty.They weigh quite a bit actually.they are really strong seats.I liked the color choices too, and let my 4 y/o daughter and my 3 y/o son pick out the colors they wanted from the website.They are very easy to install.i liked the anchor strap being as long as it is...it makes it so easy to find an anchor whether the seat is forward facing or rear facing and in any type of vechile.It comes with extra padding for the little bitty ones and is easily removed.the shoulder straps have several notches and fit any size child well.My daughter is very little for her age and i had a hard time finding anything in a booster that would hold her at her height/weight but this seat works so well.I do wish this seat had cup holders like some, and the strap clip at the armpit level is VERY easy for kids to get undone, so you might have to change it out w/something a bit more child proof.my 3y/o son went through this phase were he thought it was 'funny' to unbuckle that thing while i was driving.Over all i really like this seat and wish i had found it sooner it could have saved me SO much money over the years.Ok, I love this seat.Come to find out I loved it...and went and bought a second!We opted to put our 17m old RF behind the driver and our 3.5yr old FF on our plus one seat in the Honda Odyssey.This means that when #3 arrives he will comfortably fit RF behind the passenger allowing us to not have to toss a kid in the 3rd row and maintain good storage in our car.They fit so nicely.They are so easy to install.The kids are comfortable.And we got a GREAT deal on them at [...] coupon code KIDS20 is 20% off!WE love this!but who cares, it's not like you carry it with you everywhere you go.i feel very confident that my son is safe in this seat.i suppose if you use the tethers it might be complicated, but we just looped the seat belt through the underneath of it and bam!and we even went to the fire station to ensure that it's safe and correct.love love love it!also, my son loves being in this seat!Installation was effortless.I wish that were true of all baby "necessities."The belts are comfortable and seem very secure, the steel body never wiggles or slips in the backseat, and there is still room in the back of my car even with 2 car seats taking up a ton of space.We originally got these seats because our Subaru Impreza is very small and we wanted seats that might allow a third seating position to remain useful.FIrst off, we have not successfully used these to achieve that goal.While I love these seats for their relatively low center of gravity as well as for their compact size, they are behind in a few features, notably quality of the materials (the seat material and foam seems more easiliy breakable) and lack of ease in adjusting height of the harness/side protection.+'s-1) Narrow.The narrow width allows it to fit in a small footprint, freeing up the other two rear seats.I purchased this becuase it folds down for air travel.We love this car seat and so does my son.It was a little pricy, but so far worth every penny.I think he'll love the carseat even more.I wouldn't recommend a wipe warmer for anyone, really not necessary.It is nice to have the wipes upright to take up a little less room, but not really worth it.This time internet research told me Fuzzi Bunz were the way to go.So once she was a medium size (she is 20 lbs), I bought some on super-sale.I bought enough for washing every 3 days.Just buy pants a size up and you'll be fine.You can tell 3-ply versus 4-ply by simply pulling at them with 2 hands.I wish I had figured out the above with our first child.A lot of people who cloth diaper treat it like a hobby with lots of styles and the "collect them all" mentality.I bought about half used and bought some new too.I've never needed to strip.The key is wash every other day or two and use very little soap so you don't get detergent buildup.I've been using fuzzi bunz perfect size diapers since my daughter was a few weeks old and grew big enough to fit into the small size (at about 7-8 lbs).I opted for "perfect fit" because I wanted a snugger fit on my petite baby and because I just wasn't sure I would like cloth enough to use it for an entire childhood, so I figured I'd just take care of the first months and then reevaluate.My baby is now 4.5 mo old and getting big enough for the next size up (she has very chubby thighs), so I'm reevaluating, and I'm going to order Fuzzi Bunz again.First things first: cloth diapers are wonderful.I thought they'd be a lot of work and a lot of stink, but they're not.I wash diapers every other day.(If you didn't have a washer and dryer, then this might not be true for you.)Cost -- do an online search for "diaper cost calculator" and put in your numbers.I prefer them to velcro.I much prefer them to pins.I love the way these diapers look poofy and colorful on the baby's bottom.When she does, it is generally cured simply by giving her a bath withCetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, For all skin types, 16-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)and a fresh diaper afterwords.Environment -- For the first few weeks of having a baby, we used disposables.Sure there's laundry, but I think even with that consideration, this has got to be better than producing, shipping, and throwing away so many disposables.Cons:Laundry -- You have to be religious about doing your laundry on time.Most often, it's urine leaking because I've let her go to long without changing or because a bit of the microfiber insert is sticking out and wicking into her clothes.Breaking -- 1 of my 18 diapers did have a rubber band snap inside of it after the warranty ran out.It works very well.When my baby was small, they'd leak around the thighs.To minimize this, just check that the colorful and waterproof outer layer completely contains all of the soft, white parts of the diaper.Charlie's is a good choice if you have SOFT water (you probably do if you live on the West Coast), but it isn't compatible with my hard water.Diapers are back to smelling nice and clean, and the oxyclean takes out every last stain.Along with a second insert for overnight, this is a great diaper.It's ready to go again that evening.The fit is great for a toddler with larger thighs.We will move up to the XL size for sure after the newer style is available.I like this pocket diaper.I wash it just like the diapers, though choose to hang-dry it to preserve the waterproof lining.I wouldn't mind having a second, but it's easy to do without.Great find!Basically you have to gather each side of the top using both hands, as close to the middle as you can, and then tie it as tightly as possible.It's been seven or eight months since we bought it, so by now, the elastic has come out of the material at the top, but it still ties okay.There's no way to close the top.If you are a cloth diapering parent, this bag is essential.We love it, and it holds up well, wash after wash.It has never leaked and I wash my diapers every other day.(it was the only color in stock at the time).it would be incredibly easy for top-loaders, but it also works for front-loaders.It has a zipper at the bottom and you can unzip the bottom of the bag and drop the diapers into the laundry.It is not too big of a bag, gently encouraging you to wash your diapers more often.I bought 2 of these, one was pink and one yellow...one side is a beautifully soft white fleece material, and the other is known as PUL...which is a waterproof material.you are suppose to lay baby on fleece side because it is comfty, and if baby pees or poops on it by accident, the PUL will prevent it from soaking through to whatever is underneath.if they get dirty, i toss them in the wash with the othe rcloth diapers i have.you cant wash with reg wash due to detergent requirements.this does fold up much more compactly than the vinyl changing pads.I love this changing pads,they are soft and very well made.We use a different brand of cloth diapers for everyday diapering, but we bought the whit fuzzibunz specifically for pictures and it is just as cute as I hoped!One of the best things about this diaper is that it washes nicely and dries quickly.Another concern I had about Fuzzibunz is that the inside of the diaper seems to get really warm and moist due to it being made of fleece, and I worry that a newborn may get overheated in the summer.For a one year old, it's not as big of a deal.Then set aside a time to stuff and adjust all the rest of your Fuzzibunz to the size that works.I would definitely suggest not washing them at a laundromat (I think that's what caused the repelling).Love the color selection, love having the extra insert and elastic, and love the snaps.They are very soft and comfortable and wash well.I can't offer a recommendation on a smaller baby since I came to use these later, but they fit my 24 lb 9 month old great.Although the for me, theFuzziBunz One Size Cloth Diaper, Butterdo have a better fit.This diaper is great, slimmer than other brands, and easy to clean.I love that FuzziBunz has so many great colors, and the fit is awesome!We've been using these since our son was born.They are very absorbent, as well, in our experience.We are also very diligent about changing him frequently, usually every 2 hours, so we don't need to use the 2nd insert at the same time, but if you change yours less often then you could double them up.It costs a bit more (about 8 cents per liner), but totally worth it to not have to wash poop out anymore.I know a few people who went with the BumGenius, and without exception, they all tell me that the velcro on those started to go around 12 months.I am trying some of these and some BumGenius 4.0 on my 2 1/2 yo twin girls.)Both diapers are awesome.I have some large perfect size fuzzibuns and the OS at the biggest setting is not as big as the large perfect size, as far as I can tell (my perfect size are older, not sure how they compare to the current line)I think FBs newborn insert will absorb more than BGs, while BGs bigger insert will hold more than FBs (BGs are only 3 layers, but longer and wider, so overall I think there is more material)The Fuzzibuns are super cute, super trim, come in a ton of colors, wash up very nicely, and I LOVE how easy it is to replace the elastic (not that I have needed to yet).If your kids tend to be small, or train early, though, these will probably work well for you.I was so excited when I purchased these because of all the cute colors they came in and that they're so highly recommended by EVERYONE.The fit is great and so customizable.I take two stars off because in order to prevent blowouts, I have to have the fit around the legs tight enough to prevent gapping and that almost always leaves a red mark around my baby's legs.Other than that, they wash well and the absorbency is very customizable with how much you stuff it.Prefolds have been my preference and still is.This was very surprising considering these pockets aren't even used that often.So the life of these diapers were still fairly new.They say it could be used for up to two children depending on wear and tear, but I'm really beginning to doubt that.Also, I sent them multiple colors of damaged ones and they sent back only one color for all the replacements.Another huge con that supersedes all the others is that you need to be prepared for stripping these diapers on a regular basis.It's not so much this brand in particular, but synthetic fibers will build residue much more easily than natural fibers.They don't wash out easily, so they will need more manual stripping.If I want more pockets I'm going to give BumGenius a shot.I really like these liners, they fit perfectly in my gdiapers and so very rarely leak.I love the sized FB.Perhaps she cannot see the straps or they are not as restricting.She is safely placed in it though so don't fear if it is safe or not.My only complaint would be the place where her head lies is a bit hard.Also, no complaint, but the color green is a lot brighter in person than on the page.The rocking motion is an addition, my husband uses it to rock our daughter to sleep.If I could find one bad quality - it would probably be the color design - I wish they had different color themes - but that's the only minor con, otherwise, this chair is lovely.She's a big baby (98th percentile in weight and length) and it has been working out just wonderfully for her (she's not big enough to sit unassisted yet, but that hasn't mattered though she's pretty strong).I liked it so much I bought one for my mom's house (my mother-in-law and my sister-in-law both have one that they use for my nephews - a 2 y/o and a 2 m/o - and they're also pleased).I bought it for my 6 month old son since he outgrew his infant seat.Needed something to easily tote around the house.This is very light weight and easy to bring from one place to another.Colors and hanging toys are great!I love this rocker.It is great for sleep time and awake time.We brought this for our 3 month old baby.She loves it.It is very easy to assemble and is very comfortable for the baby.This has different positions, so you can change the position when the baby is sleeping to make her comfortable.We registered for it and got it as a gift, and don't have any way to return it now.Issues:1.It has a huge footprint in our small apartment.It's very sturdy, but we wish we would have thought about that before we bought it.3.After months, we finally figured out how to move the mobile (you have to push it pretty hard).I purchased this item for my infant twins.Easy to assemble when following instructions.Lots of sounds choices.Good volume control.It has to warm up.I cannot wait for it to warm up - on several occasions this waiting has awakened the baby.We never used the glide feature because it is not smooth.because you'll likely have to return it.We burned through the motor of 2 Fisher Price Ocean Wonders cradle swings with my first child, but we loved that swing.It has many features I prefer to the full-size swing in the same collection- it uses energy more efficiently, the seat cradles the baby more, its portable.I love watching him bouncy-bouncy-bounce.she goes to town jumping in it while playing with the toys.My son (5 months) love this!He can easily and happily bounce in it for about 20 minutes.I bought this for him at 4 months but he was not able to turn himself in it and he didn't bounce much.My six-month-old baby really enjoys this jumparoo, and it is a lifesaver when I can't carry her--like when I'm getting ready in the morning or cooking.Probably not a big deal to many, but in our Manhattan apartment space is at a premium.I bought this exact item from a "gently used" baby store.My grandson loves the different activities all around.The seat is easy for me to remove the cover and wash, and there are no sharp/pointed edges anywhere!!!!!The height adjustment is simple to do (can't do it with baby in it, but you shouldn't anyway).The bright colors, friendly faces, and variety of shapes keep baby interested for a long time.The only real con on this product, but really applies to most jumpers, is that they don't fold down compact for storage, so that's why I bought one so my kids wouldn't have to try to transport theirs when they visit.We have as much fun watching our grandson play and bounce in it as he is having.I love this jumperoo but I'm thinking her legs get a little sore in it after about 20 minutes because she starts to fuss.But we still love it and won't be getting rid of it anytime soon!I will take a baby-free 20 minutes anytime!My daughter can entertain herself for quiet a while in her jumperoo so mommy can get some housework done.Once he started playing, I noticed the stand seemed a bit wobbly and so I took the baby out to check the base.Purchased as a gift.Easy to assemble.The purple ring doesn't make any noise.My son will play with the giraffe more than the rings.He likes to touch and eat his ears.He will turn the giraffe over and play the drums on the bottom!My son really likes this toy, but there is a drawback: the giraffe is too lightweight.Now at 14 months he has starting holding it himself, but it would still be nice if the base was a little heavier to prevent it toppling.Perhaps they are concerned that this might be a safety hazard?My son loves it!This bouncer is great for the price.I love the colors and I was surprised to find that my newborn is not too small for it.The bouncer also moves really easy when she kicks her legs.A bouncer is very useful, especially one like this that has a round leg construction, which will help the baby to bounce, not just sit there.Another benefit of this particular bouncer is that the seat is deep, hence it's difficult for the baby to lean forward.In no time he but figured out himself what fun he can have in it.I have not used the vibrating function much, when I do, the baby just looks surprised and a bit uncomfortable.You'll be surprised how much this bouncer actually bounces as a result!My baby boy is 5.5 months old and now he can really bounce strong -- he loves it!It took him some time, but he figured out how to slide the button to the right to turn on vibration.He still doesn't know how to slide the button to the left, but is working on it.We bought this bouncer primarily for the price, but also the good reviews.In most respects, it hasn't disappointed.The colors are vibrant and fun, and the batteries for the vibrating mechanism lasted a surprisingly long time.Note that it doesn't bounce on its own - just gently vibrates.The recline feature is nice when I am giving my daughter a bottle.If your looking for a space saver then I would recommend this one!It has three positions to accomidate infants, babies, and toddlers and converts to a booster seat.The print is gender nutral and pretty easy to wipe clean.I did not want a bulky traditional high chair for my second child so I purchased this item.I am pretty satisfied - it's easy to set up, tray is nice and big, chair and pad are very easy to clean (no hidden nooks where the food can hide) and my baby seems comfortable in it.Thankfully, the chair has a cross slat in the back so I fit the top of the seat through the whole between the slats.I do not like the child restraining straps.My baby is chunky, 22 lbs at 8 months and I am concerned about him being comfortable in this seat as he gets bigger.So far I am satisfied with the item but I could have gotten a bigger more comfortable traditional high chair for him for a few more bucks.As many other people have said, this high chair is wonderful if you don't want another piece of furniture.It fits on the chair perfectly.We bought this for our 15 month old.The fabric wipes off easily though.It is easier to just wash it by hand.I got this for my 4.5 months old baby and it is great for our small NYC apartment.It will fit on any chair (our chairs are quiet small, but the harness is not my favorite, but it is what it is, for what it costs, they could have made it padded or something.Overall, it is a good chair for small apartment or for grandparents, no major complaints about it yet.Whenever one gets soiled we switch to the other one and put the dirty one in the wash. We love them so much we're ordering a third so we can have a diaper changing area on our first floor.I love the soft blue color of this, it also fits my contoured changing pad perfectly.It is soft for my baby and is easy to wash and care for.Other than that, these pacifiers are perfect.The pacifier strap system that you can get for these work really well too.I got nice footprints of my baby and it seems to last.The air dry clay is impossible to work with.So much for a treasured keepsake!I bought these cups to use with my daughter's lunches and keeping in mind that we had a new baby coming soon.We've been using the snack cups for several months now and I love them!For my baby, who will soon be needing solid foods, they'll be the perfect size for homemade baby food, cheerios, etc.The lids fit snugly, and my daughter (12 months) hasn't yet figured out how to open them.I wish I'd bought more - we use these all the time.Great purchase!The striped design mixed with the alphabet is quite contemporary and it gives you such a variety of colors to work with that it is truly gender neutral.They look great over my windows, were simple to install, and will stay in that room for many years to come!I was looking for crib sheets to make our nursery more playful... these turned out perfect.The pattern is fun and colorful.The pattern is very cute and has lots of colors that can match different styles.The sheet isn't the softest I've ever felt, but I am happy with the quality.I REALLY wish I had read the other reviews here before I bought this thing.I doubt kids will get any of the tiny squeaks out of this thing at all, because it's not fun to try and try to get a noise that sounds nothing like a giggle, and is too quiet to really be of any use at all.The clicking sound that the bananas make is more annoying (like something breaking) than fun, and the "giggling" sound is quiet and an adult really has to put some force into whipping it around to get it to make the sound at all.It's an excellent item for its price.Fit perfectly my stroller.I bought this for my 13 month old boy.It is easy for a child to remove the inner potty, but I think that is okay because we are teaching our son to flush.We have not had a problem with needing a different style of splash guard - this one works well.I do think that it is small... our son is tall for his age and I wonder if he will be comfortable on it at age 2.My 16 month old daughter loves it, and so do I.It is the perfect size, both feet can reach the floor, and it's the only potty we have found to be able to do so.Perfect color for either sex too.The seat size is the same - the removable inner potty is the same on both models.2.The Smart Potty seems harder to topple, though not impossible.In the end I purchased the Smart Potty.It takes up little space in the bathroom and cabinet.My son absolutely loves this bouncer!It was easy to put together, very supportive, and easy to clean.Colors are very cute as well!I love this bouncie-chair!The entire seat comes off of the frame and you can just throw it in the wash.However, I do not like that the toys on the toy bar do not detach, nor do they make noise or really do anything all that stimulating for a baby.This isn't a huge deal because I can still attach hanging rattles and chimes to it.I would rather it took AA's or something equally easy to find.My son is only three months old so he's just started using the jumperoo and interacting with it.Our 3 month old LOVES this rattle.She giggles when it shakes and the little beads inside move.Honestly this is the first rattle that really catches her attention.She likes to grasp it herself, it's light enough for her to do so.A great deal here on Amazon as well.I think its the colors and different textures.My son was unenthused with most rattles, but he loved this one.He liked holding it with both hands, chewing on it and looking at the black and white contrast since he was 3 months old when I bought it.When I first seen this item, I thought that it was going to be very cheaply made.However, when I received this item it exceeded my expectations.This rattle is very good made for a rattle and I got it for a great price.So, I'm very pleased about this.I bought one of these for my son for Christmas and I know he will love it.He is 3 months old and it was hard to decide exactly what to get him, because he is not that old yet, but this is perfect.It's not too big or too small and the small beads inside of it are sure to keep his attention!This works great as a rattle in that it actually does make some noise and can easily distract baby while he is crying.I think the motion helps too.It is good as a teether in that my baby can grab onto it easily and bring it to his mouth with his hands.Better than just trying to eat his hands...With the economy these days, you really shouldn't complain about a toy that costs $3.My 7 month old is in a "ring" phase so she loves loves loves anything that's in the shape of a circle.This is easy to manipulate and it has a rattling noise.The big ball in the middle is a bonus for her since she seems to chew on everything these days.I should note that this ring is bigger than the Sassy Ring O' Links and the big ball is also bigger than her little mouth but she doesn't seem to mind.Great colors, feel, and size.Love the contrast it has.It's easy to hold onto and get in his mouth!I bought this for my baby daughter for stocking stuffers.The colors are bright and contrastive.We took this on our trip to Disney World and it worked great.It was very easy to work - you still have to bend down and loop the wire through your tires, but if you didn't it wouldn't be much of a lock!!!Even when the Disney World staff moved the stroller and the wire got caught up in the wheels, it was easy to release the wire.The only issue that we had was a user issue.I didn't give my husband training on how to unlock it and he left us to get the stroller while my son and I rode Peter Pan for the 5th time.Throughout the ride I kept thinking to myself "please don't let him try to get the lock off."Solid, my daughter loves it, the raised lip to trap liquids and food works well.Very expensive item though...The Tripp Trapp PlayTray is excellent.It also brings the food closer to our baby so she can easily reach it and lets her eat at a comfortable height.Also the surface is no-scratch and so far it still looks like new.It's made in europe, and from the design I have a feeling it could be made by a company owned by Stokke or directly for them because the quality is right up there with the chair itself.Expensive bur worth the price.However, when the need arises, it's nice not to have to sterilize a bottle get it ready and then wash/rinse/sterilize again for another use.However, this is a great alternative to baby bottles in general.These work great as "back-up" bottles for my 1-year-old.For those times when you just need a clean bottle, and fast, these are excellent.They don't replace regular bottles for everyday living, but they're not designed to.She's an absolute angel and the first baby in my family that I'm actually willing to keep.These are perfect for the one time every three months that I babysit.Can't open the top without tearing the bottle apart, so you either can't rinse or you get to struggle with broken pieces of bottle if you want to recycle.The baby was willing to use them, perhaps because she knew nothing was coming out of my boobies, so they work.I thought that these disposable bottles would give me an occasional break from my dreaded task.This is because the nipple on the Steribottle is a fast-flow so you're better off waiting until baby is closer to six months old.We bought a 5-pack of these bottles for a recent long weekend trip.It's tricky but it worked OK without breaking.Try them before you travel (or have a backup).Always ready to go, you can fill on the spot with ease.Steri-botles are wellmade and I only wish, for the price, there were more in the package.Recommended.Is there seriously even a market for this item?Although, I prefer to be more eco-friendly with a baby you never know when you will be in a bind.I could always carry a sterilized re-useable bottle but I travel often and every piece of weight counts.The bottles are bpa-free and also make a great cup without the nipple.We've been using these bottles for trips with our six-month-old.Our only gripe is that the seal around the top leaks when you shake whatever's inside.But assuming that you keep them in a relatively safe place, they'll be as "sterile" as your reusable bottles.Well, honestly, the price.Sometimes, especially when you're trying to keep up with young ones, convenience wins out over cost or environmental concerns...Overall, I'm really pleased with these bottles and will definitely use them in the future.They are just the right size, not too big like the cloth diapers and not too small like some other ones I have.On one side is the pattern, and the other side is terry cloth.Like them, they have a colorful fabric back, with an absorbent fabric on the other side.In the case of the Trend Lab cloths, the absorbent fabric is terry cloth, which works better and is thick enough that the burp cloths don't wrinkle in the dryer.However, it's nice to have a few of the Trend Lab cloths for more formal occasions when you're out with the baby.FYI:  Another absorbent option -- one that's much larger than the Trend Lab cloths, and also nicer than a white prefold -- is the Aden + Anais burp cloth.I was happy to have received this so fast.We have the Snugride32 and this base fits perfectly.Got this for my then 7 month old daughter and she loved it!She loves chewing on every part of her banana brush.You think your floor is clean, but the banana hits the floor and you have to rinse it off before giving it back to baby.Despite that, I still love it.I read so many great reviews for it and loved the fact that I could carry my baby in front, in back, and on the hip with it- as opposed to the Bjorn which I can only carry in the front.I knew that I could only carry the baby facing me when carried in the front position, but since I figured I'd be able to use it also when the baby's older and carry him on my back or on my hip, I decided to sacrifice that feature.It was easy to put on and felt comfortable.I like the Sport carrier because my husband could use it as well.It wasn't that big of a deal in the beginning until he got really big.I think my baby would probably be better in that right now.My friends love the Ergo, and I love it too- but my baby's not a huge fan of it right now.I haven't tried the hip position, but I will later on.The Ergo's definitely the MOST comfortable though.I am not kidding, it has changed our life!We love carrying our kiddos around, they like to be close to mama and papa and we like how easy it is to hold them close for long periods of time.multiple times a day- and it is NEVER uncomfortable.We can put our 2 1/2 year old in it back pack style for hikes and it is a life saver!Otherwise, I'd have to use the double stroller, and I like having the little baby close to me (he does too!!But it was really easy after only a few times of getting used to it.I am 5' 3", 105 lbs, and I found adjusting the straps after you put it on to be not hard at all, actually quite smooth.My husband is 6' 2", 175 lbs, and he finds it equally easy to adjust.My husband has no problems at all; sometimes for me it just takes a little extra effort, that's all.Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this to any parents.You will enjoy the togetherness, and you bet they will!Studies show babies brains develop more rapidly and have less stress hormones (duh) when being carried.They are also more content, both while being carried and for the rest of the day- I will attest to that.This is an excellent investment for you and your baby.So far (baby is 16 lbs) it is comfortable to wear for me and my husband, and our little one seems quite happy too!Loosen the shoulder/arm straps, which will give you a bit of slack and allow you to snap the horizontal strap at a higher point.Our son takes his cup to daycare every day, and one of the other kids uses the same type of cup.We bought these to stick on the cups, and now we/she always knows whose is who's!I took off a star only because I felt they were a touch big - they stay on his cups fine, but they only fit snugly around the base where it's largest.But, I think that's mostly personal preference.These bands are a nice, less-expensive alternative to a lot of similar labels that I've seen.They smudged off somewhat right away, so you can still read them, but they are faint ... and yet dark enough that I can't really write over them.I bought this stroller for my twin boys who are now 6 months old.Other than that I love taking my boys out for a walk in their stroller any chance i get.First thing when I opened the box I was hit with the smell of the fabric which was very intense, the stroller has required time outside to air out because the fabric of the seats is not able to be washed.The black wheels look really nice and the red fabric looks much better than I thought it would.Yes, it's large but it's not significantly larger than the duoglider we used to have.It's much larger than our combi side by side but makes up for it by having a nice big basket (the combi just has a little pouch type 'basket' way underneath).The seats are about the same size as the duoglider with an added footrest, they seem much more comfortable for the kids.I have an average sized four year old who fits ok in the seats, his knees are bent and his head comes up a bit over the top of the seat but he doesn't seem to mind and likes being able to sit if he wants to.It fits in the back of my 07 honda minivan just fine.The back seat needs to come off but it just takes a moment.I haven't tried to get a replacement yet and I'm hoping they will send me one, for now the pin is just resting there with a small piece of tape holding it in place.The second is that the frame was scuffed in a few places and the warning labels are printed on the frame crookedly, I know it will get scuffed eventually and the warning labels aren't that big a deal but it would have been nice to have it look perfect for a bit first.To some, it might not be a big deal but to others it will be.We've been using this for over a year with twins(started using them when they were 5 months & they're now 17 months)CONS*No Food Tray-this was something I never thought about when I was pregnant & looking for strollers(1st time parent) but there have been many instances where having a food tray would have really helped.Like we just took a trip to the Zoo and there were no highchairs or anything and since their seats didn't have a tray we had to hold them on our lap(it was not an easy task) 2 of our friends went with us and both their strollers had trays and their kids(same age as ours) just sat in theirs and happily ate.Had I known what I know now, I would have gotten a stroller w/ the feeding trays...and a place for them to have a cup would have been nice too.*You can't change a diaper in these seats.*The front canopy takes up the back passengers space if it isn't up all the way.A sleepy baby is not a happy baby and I think a stroller w/ reclining seats for naps is a must.We've been on trails in the woods where other people w/ strollers were, they were struggling to push theirs and we were easily breezing right by.*Durable.We did have the parent tray crack & fall off after a couple months of use(thats kind of cheap) but I sent the company an email and they sent me a replacement at no charge to me & w/ no hassle.*It looks nice.We get compliments on this all the time.And pushing a bright red double stroller w/ twins will definately get you noticed...so if you don't like attention, you might not want to get this ; )Overall, its a great stroller but you need to think what your family will be using this stroller for.And also that there are now cupholders for the kids seats, another plus.One of them doesn't have a better view than the other, they both have a great view.I love this necklace.It looks stylish but it is soft, flexible, and chewable.My baby loves it.The bronze color is fantastic and doesn't look like plastic.I just wish it cost a little less so I could buy a few more colors.WOW, this is a great necklace.It is so great that I bought 3 of them in different colors so I would always have one around to wear.Our daughter started teething at 4 months and had 2 teeth out and fully functional before her 6 month birthday, so we had lot of chewing right out of the babygate.These necklaces look like stone or jade rings, but have the perfect semi-soft texture that is great for teething babes.Before I found these, I had a goofy looking teething ring I'd wear on my wrist; I am not a vanity hound, but since there are days I am under-slept and/or don't get to wash my hair -- it is nice to wear something pretty.This would make a wonderful shower gift, or gift to aunties and grandmasI have to say that this works 100x better than a bulb sucker.The Nosefrida only does about 85% of the job though.You can see progress and not stick something too far up his nose.He fusses sometime, even cries when we do it, but as soon as we are done I show him the nosefrida and all the goop, he stops crying and sometimes even smiles!Highly recommended.This is a really practical potty.Compared to some of the others on the market, it's a little higher, too--more like a little potty.My daughter loves it.Like other reviewers, I find the side compartments a little tricky to open, but once you get the hang of it, they're fine; I wouldn't put anything in there you'd expect your child to access, however, if you've snapped them shut.This potty has been a lifesaver on many occasions during potty training!Maybe they lock into place a little *too* well!Other than that, which really isnt much of a complaint, I love these.They are also good for cereal/formula mixture.But these work much better for that.She can't escape from this swaddle, it's true, but it leaves her so much space for her arms to move around, she works herself into a frenzy.She isn't securely held in, so she can never settle and only fights it.When we bought the smaller one, it was so so tight it was hard to get on.The woombie is nice, but we prefer the swaddleme.Our daughter seems to be able to move a bit more in the woombie and wake up a bit sooner.The woombie is a bit more goof-proof.The woombie is also made of a thin knit, so it's not as warm as the microfleece swaddleme.She loves being swaddled, but I was concerned before that her blanket I was swaddling her with would come open and possibly block her airway somehow.I think that this would be a great addition to their line and hopefully they will consider this.Since my daughter prefers to have her hands-free to suck on her fingers sometimes I unzip the top zipper a bit on this Woombie so that she has access to them.(To temporarily deter movement and rolling for a few minutes, try securing the legs with a light blanket with ends tucked under the mattress.)A feature I would have liked, but am not sure how well it could be designed, is a two-way zipper so that I can change the diaper without freeing the arms.If all other swaddles don't work for you, try the Woombie.I bought the summer two-way zippers version several months ago and love it.There is one catch though: the two-way zipper version has a velcro neck clasp instead of the snap button style of the original.As the baby tries to escape through the neck whole, or tries to scratch its face, the edge of the velcro scratches (draws blood.Highly recommend the Woombie for as long as it's safe, and then switching over to ScratchSleeves, which goes up to size 4T-5T!She's escaped the swaddle me wraps, the miracle blanket and regular swaddling.The color didn't really matter so I didn't return it.The toy it comes with is entertaining for baby while you are getting the food ready.Very happy with it.I would MUCH rather use this cute item than have an injured child who ran into a car.I was torn between the lion and sheep for my little girl and am so glad I chose the sheep - it is absolutely adorable.We did use it recently when we attended the grand opening of a theme park, I didn't want to risk being separated in the large crowd.Perfect for large crowds, or for toting small toys and snacks.More than anything, I have a couple around the house with a couple diapers and pack of wipes to lay under her bum for quick changes, without big changing pads everywhere, they fit nicely in your purse, work good for putting soft side up in swings, etc.They aren't very large, they're not to protect a crib mattress in its entirity, but for a little accident, I was very happy with them.However, not good burp pads, in my opinion.These are nice, but nothing fancy.The center part is terry cloth material, so it's nice and soft.I also got a few of the full terry cloth covers (which are about $15-20 each!)and they're not worth the price.I bought these for our Ergo because our 4-month-old started gnawing on the straps.I was concerned about being able to wash the Ergo and thought these would be great.I considered making them, but having a 4-month-old was about enough work for me.:) They're nice and thick, attach and detach easily and wash really well.Our baby is now 9 months old and they're still in excellent condition!That said, it does lay such that babies would munch on the straps too much.These suck pads are just the thing to prevent the baby from this.They're soft on her skin, easy to remove to wash, and in my opinion, necessary for the Ergo carrier.My baby was sucking on the straps of our ergo carrier right where these pads go, so it works out great to put these on and then wash just the pads rather than the whole carrier constantly.Once my daughter started wanting to bite on everything, I realized that you certainly do need at least one, if not more, pairs of these.We settled on this glider in part due to the reviews it received, the price for the glider, and the brand name.Amazon was stellar as usual with the shipping and handling of the glider.The gliding aspect of it is flawless, effortless to use, and works like a dream.The arm rests are a great height to rest your arms while holding a baby.It is a solid unit that does what it says.they came with a fast flow nipple - I didn't have to buy additional nipples3.That is a dealbreaker considering it takes her 30 minutes to take an 8 oz bottle if you have to pull it out of her mouth every few minutes.This is the perfect no fuss, very simple bottle.It's the same height as our Playtex Drop-In bottles, but those only hold about 7 oz of milk, so not a good long-term solution and we were outgrowing them quickly.The nipples for these bottles are a 3 (fast flow), so if your baby is still using slow or medium, you will need to purchase additional nipples, but they're very reasonable.Baby transitions to this nipple easily, it's orthodontic and silicone, bottles are BPA-free, and the price is right.To those who complain the bottom doesn't come off or it's not like the other bottles, they are right...this is NOT part of the MAM Ultivent line.Those bottles are all pastels and have a colored bottom.This one has a lot of extras instead if just being anbag on a stand.I love the way it wraps around the frame and velcro's to keep the frame from streaching and tearing the tie straps.Very happy with this purchase!I have yet to find the perfect diaper bag, and my son is 18 months old!People ask me why the heck I'm still looking for one (when I have three and my son is almost out of diaper-bag-age) but I just can't stop looking because I want THE PERFECT ONE.And it's pretty good, but it's certainly not perfect.* I like the outside end pockets--which are perfect for sippy cups, cell phones, or keys.* I like most of the inside pockets--nicely elasticized, with room for bigger things like diapers and wipes (in one), a big tiered snack container, a receiving blanket, a few hars of foods, a handful of medicine bottles...or my wallet!A strong magnet might have been better (although if the bag was packed to the hilt, it wouldn't close).* The straps themselves feel and look kind of cheap.So overall I just don't love them.* I don't love the one big internal pocket on the one side.There is a velcro strap that attaches at the mid-point so that the pocket doesn't get too out of control, but I don't love it.* There are no insulated pockets.I could understand if this cost less than $5 but that's obviously not the case.Nowhere on the actual label attached to the toy does it say "organic cotton".What it does say is, "Content consisting of PLA-polylactide fibers" and "Made in China".Make your own conclusions as to whether or not you should trust this company.This seat looked more durable, comfortable, and was my son's favorite color (aqua blue).The WeePod has a very cushy seat and splash guard that easily wipes clean, though some liquid does go into the cracks underneath the seat.I bought the Fisher one first and didn't fit the toilet, it was also uncomfortable for my baby.This one is great because it is adjustable and so comfortable for the kids.These are a must have item in my book!I'm sad because my girl is about to grow out of it, it is the BESt little chair for a baby in small spaces and travel!I have a Fisher Price "Soothe 'n Play Safari" bouncerSoothe 'N Play Safari Bouncerfor my 2+ year old that was terrific but not convenient for trips.The Infantino one appears more "complicated" and bulkier, but actually can easily fold into a compact shape more appropriate for travel.While it makes the Fisher Price look "cheap", the Fisher Price Safari has the edge though in simplicity and comfort with its springy legs which give a very natural rocking or bouncing motion.I would say that the Fisher Price is a no frills model that just excels in having the right contoured shape with a great bouncy feel from its simple bent metal frame.I think if you have a kid under 25 lbs, either the Fisher Price Safari or the Infantino would be wonderful bouncers.This bouncer is good for people that travel or live in a small home easy to fold, the features this bouncer have are great music, heartbeat, sounds of the sea two types of volume or mute and vibration mode, and the toy are pretty, is a very nice bouncer and you can buy this for a baby boy or a girl.As a self-proclaimed "minimalist" parent, I appreciated the Fold and Go's simplistic and stylish design.It really does fold nicely, and I've put the cover through the wash several times (not through the dryer!)It's true that it doesn't actually bounce (at least not for little ones), but the vibration is nice.I rarely use the nature sounds (wind, rushing water, and a heartbeat) and I have only heard the music option by accident.Recommended for any parent who has an easily overstimulated little one.Edit: I wanted to add that I couldn't put my little one down for the first month of her life, so we never used this when she was just born.When my little one fell asleep, I often leaned the seat back a bit by propping the front edge on a folded blanket so she could recline a bit more (as many reviewers have noted, there is only one position on this seat).I'm sure that doing this is not recommended by the manufacturer, but I found the position to be stable enough as she dozed next to me.This is a really nice looking bouncer.It is great for travel.It doesnt lean properly, the position is too vertical for younger kids.For older kids, the bucket is not deep enough to hold them comfortably.I wish I had an adult-sized one.The vibration-mode works like a charm, and there are different sounds of nature and music to softly lull the baby to sleep.Semi serious here; note that this bouncer doesn't have a pogo-stick in it and will bounce your baby all over the place by itself (LOL)... it is a kinetic engine and uses your baby's movements to bounce him/her gently about.It requires a couple of AA batteries; if I recall, there were a couple that came with the seat/chair/bouncer, but they didn't live long compared to the good batteries available in stores.We just bought one of these for our friend who is expecting her first very soon, so we highly recommend it!This bouncer folds up nicely and I'm able to bring it anywhere I go.I don't know of many(if any) foldable bouncers, so if you travel from place to place alot with your baby, this may be the perfect item to get.We have a wide variety of teethers here at the house, & none of them seemed to satisfy our little man (4 months old).He loves it as much as I do!It is very flexible, making it easy for him to bend & shove to the back of his mouth (which is a little smaller than most)...where he seems to be teething...no other teether, even those made for back teeth, actually worked for him.It is easy to grasp, easy to clean (hairs & fuzz haven't clinged to it like they do a binki), & very stimulating.He loves it!We even have it on his binki clip, keeping it close to him at all times.It easily fits on my wrist as well...but he has to hold it himself...and he can do too because it is PERFECT!Thanks LifeFactory!Highly recommend it!Once again Lifefactory  has hit the mark with their BPA, phtalate, PVC and latex free teether.It, also, can be placed in the freezer to become cool - but you do READ MORE @ [...]i am so happy that i found this camera separate from the monitor.Its nice that i can still look in on my daughter with out having a whole separate video monitor!AND i love the original video monitor by the way.We liked it so much, we bought a second to put in my daughter's room.Not only can we check the well being of our kids from afar, and see if they're grousing in sleep or are genuinely awake, we can also watch the crazy pre-sleep shenanigans.I love it.It's static sometimes depending on where you have it and where people walk etc, but nothing that disturbs us from being able to see our son.Recently we had a new baby and wanted to keep the camera in my sons room and didn't realize until after researching on amazon that I could add an extra camera.PERFECT!!!So now we have my son on A and our baby girl on B and we can press the button to see between the two rooms.I mostly keep it on the baby but I like to be able to "check in" with my son to make sure he's being safe in his toddler bed.I bought this camera because the wife and I wanted to be able to monitor the baby in her room and the living room (rather 2 rooms without moving a camera all over).This works great with the Summer infant system we got.I bought this for a trip across the country with my 8-month old, and it has since proved extremely useful in all kinds of instances.Airplane use:My only real complaint about this product is that there is no maximum height given online, it simply indicated there is a line on the tag.So you have no way of knowing if your child is too tall until you actually order it and have the FlyeBaby and your baby in front of you.I would only really recommend this to lay a baby in on a plane for 6 months and under.However this was still useful on the plane for us.What I did was install it as described in the directions, then I sat cross-legged and sat my daughter upright on my lap facing me.I did not lay her back on it, as her head would have been pretty much touching the tray table, and that is a big safety issue.We didn't have any of my daughter's usual 'gadgets' with us (exersaucer, bumbo seat, walker, high chair etc etc), so this was invaluable to give us a place to secure her.The straps are extremely versatile and this can easily be installed on any chair I've found thus far.The harness that secures the baby is safe without being overly restricting, and adjusts to a wide range of sizes (perfect for my TALL baby).I just bought this stroller for my 3 month old daughter.I have to say I am very happy with it.I absolutely love it!!If you are looking for a lightweight stoller with lots of features that is priced great, look no further because this is it!Also i don't like the way the tray for the baby isn't easily removable.It was big & bulky, missing some convenience features, and was difficult to use off smooth pavement.can attach links to the hood!cushy seat!great parent tray!Shocks & larger wheels, making a smooth ride!stands when folded!pretty compact when folded, but not umbrella-sized.And, even purchasing it used, it has held-up great & seems quite sturdy.My son also loves to ride in it, and he wasn't a fan of riding in the other strollers.Seriously, if the features on this stroller meet your needs, then GET IT!I'd say, skip the big bulky travel system and get this.Higher than other umbrella strollers, but still at 5"7', I feel a little hunched over.- I would like if it had a 5 point harness system.It takes up about half the space that our Chicco Cortina stroller did in our vehicle.I love the storage area and have been pleased with the parent tray as well.For an inexpensive stroller, this definitely does the trick!On a side not, we have debated going with this stroller over the Kolcraft Contours Lite stroller that was in the same price range.The Kolcraft was about the same height as the jeep and didn't have the nice parent tray.It did, however have the nice 5 point harness system.UPDATE: Almost 3 years later, we still love this stroller!It has held up nicely.I thought since the Chicco was so expensive that there might be something amazing about it that would make me love it more than my Jeep stroller, but I was wrong!The storage space is huge and easy to get to, unlike the chicco.The parent tray and cupholders are also great (also unlike the Chicco.)I absolutley LOVE this stroller!It's so lightweight, easy to manuever and looks great!Even she loved pushing it saying it was so easy.My son is 30 lbs and fits great in the stroller.The snack tray is very convenient for him and the parent cupholders are nice.I wouldn't recommend it for a newborn but anywhere from 6 mnths plus it's great.Color is also a little darker than what's pictured but it's a great color, more like a brown/tan but very gender neutral and I prefer the darker anyhow.I ended up with this one because we were flying to California and I didn't want to be mad if something happened to my stroller while on the plane, etc.I ordered it, it came in great time, everything in the box was fine, I put it together myself, and took it for a spin.Not the end of the world, but still I found it a bit odd.I like how small and light it is but there are some concerns.If you notice all of the nice lightwt.If you go down a curb be sure to go backwards or your baby will hit her mouth on the tray.After reading reviews, I purchased this chair to use for travel and wanted to share my experience for other parents like me who read a gazillion reviews and agonize over whether they are making the right baby-product choice.I will say that it is well-designed, sturdy, well padded, with high-quality fabric, and a clever attached carry bag.My almost 16-month-old has insisted on feeding herself for several months now and when she eats there is food EVERYWHERE.This portable chair is attractive, washable, comfortable, and extremely secure when attached to a table.Easy to use and works well even on a table with a 4 inch "skirt."While I'm sure the P&Ts; is perfect for its intended use (on the go feeding, compact, wipe clean-ability) it wasn't the greatest for a full time chair.I needed something that my elbow flying, hand smacking babe wouldn't hurt himself in.He's able to listen and watch intently.Has self storing capabilities with a stow pocket at the bottom.It hasn't been taken off other than for counter wipe downs since we've had it, so I can't speak to its portability- seems easy enough.Very easy to dis-assemble and reassemble.The stow bag located beneath the seat is great.The dining room table has a skirting piece around the edge that the jaws of the clamp dont open wide enough to accomodate, but we got around that by attaching it to the lip of the table.My paranoid husband is pleased with it because it is totally solid--I can't conceive of a situation where it would come off the table.It folds up to be reasonably portable (though to be honest, we haven't taken it anywhere yet, so take that with a grain of salt).I cant comoare it to some of the other, cheaper, hook-on seat options, but this one is so well-designed that I would be surprised it there was a better one.My husband and I live in a small condo so we didn't want a bulky highchair to take up the little room that we have.This Inglesina model is made of sturdy metal, and the cover is a thick canvas material.It is SO nice that he is eye level at the table with us.I am also a huge researcher.I don't buy anything without properly researching the item first.***UPDATE***So, we have had this highchair for almost 3 years now, and I still can't say enough amazing things about it!Mine has gone through a hot wash once a week for the past 3 years and it still looks amazing.I love how easy it is to clip everything back together after washing.Between washings, I find the canvas very easy to clean.Though, to remedy that, I bought the Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, which fits perfectly over and in between the arms with strong suction cups.My mother was appalled that we would get something like this, questioning the safety and stability.We both loved it!I found it to be extremely sturdy and so EASY!I love this seat!It is easy to remove, clean, and with the bag hidden under the seat it is easy to carry.We normally use this just at our home and it is perfect, because it takes up little space and looks great.I love that they're all silicone!I bought this spoon set, hoping that the silicone would be gentle for my firsttime feeder.And the whole spoon is one smooth piece of silicone that is gentle on the baby's gums and teeth.Worth the cost!Hard to find sheets for my square pack n play but this works and I'm pleased.Hard to find sheets for my square pack n play (much less a padded quilt!)but this works and I'm pleased.Adorable patterns, breathable layered muslin, and they wrap around.Carson outgrew the cutesie little bibs around three months as they started to look like a napkin tucked in his collar.Since he has started crawling, we don't use them as much as they do get in the way of an ambitious crawler.They are now one of our favorite baby shower gifts to give !She got food all over her, bib or no bib.They're made of lovely soft, cool, absorbent muslin, which is comfortable and absorbent.They wash easily and dry quickly on the line.Even carrots.These are absolutely my favorite bibs.Still, I'm very happy I bought the first pair, and if you're not strapped for cash, then you should, too!I have the swaddle blankets, washcloths and burp cloths.Love them all!There is a world of difference between them.While the ones for AE are cheaper ($15 for two) the ones sold directly under the A+A brand are much higher quality AND they are bigger too.They really do get softer the more you wash them, and while the instructions say "wash cold" I throw them in on warm and they hardly shrink and come out clean AND super soft.$20 might seem a lot of money for bibs, but they are totally worth it.more extended use).BoosMay not be the best for on-the-go bib due to its size (about the size of a cloth diaper).About $20 for a 2 pack, a little more pricey than other bibs (we personally don't mind though especially since they are two-sided).When used as a bib, may seem a little large on a 4-6 month old (OK, so we are being picky).There is no pocket to catch finger foods or reflux baby spit-ups when used as a burp cloth.(A lot of bibs don't but it is worth the mention).The Petite Consumer Says: We love the material, style, and function.We highly recommend this bib/burp cloth to all parents and as a gift.The size is perfect for the dual use as a bib and burpy cloth, and it is great for wiping spit-ups.The material is absorbent, the prints are cute and stylish, and they have held up very well wash after wash.If you love the aden + anais blankets, you'll love these burp cloths too!Great baby gift!The muslin in these has enough of a grain to scrub at grit, but is very soft and gentle on my baby's sensitive skin.They're wash cloths, and they work just as well as the other prints!As with the a+a bibs, my one major complaint is that these are so very expensive!It doesn't make sense to me why four layers of muslin should cost so much, but I can't complain too much, because they really are so much better than the rest of my washcloths.While I agree that these are very soft and excellent quality wash cloths- they are really really big.So, I read about this brand and decided to splurge and buy these for my son.Using these in his bath is a pain just because of the size.This may be a personal thing and a small complaint but thought I'd put it out there for any Mom who also feels that baby wash cloths are ideal because they are smaller in size.I do have to add though, that the quality and feel of these wash cloths are the best I've ever tried!I wanted to use something really soft on my baby for bathtime or to wipe her face and everything else on the market wasn't truely "soft" enough.Even the terry cloths can be rough on a baby's skin.I love these washcloths because they are the softest that I've ever used and they're big enough to use for toddlers.Our daughter(8 months) loves having these on and jams to the music even better (was singing along the last time she had them on).My daughter and family are big NASCAR fans.They took the baby to a publicity event and I realized the baby would need some protection for her hearing.Parents LOVE them.Baby actually WEARS them, so they must be comfortable.The pink color was a bonus.These ear muffs are a must-have item when attending loud events.They fit our 2 year old wonderfully and kept him happy at an air show we went to recently.Both my kids like it and didn't complain when I used it at all.Also I chose this because of the shape.this is an awesome product.it is gross and works.when I say it works I mean it works and cleans out the nostrils really well.Additional perk:  My two-plus month-old son isn't bothered by the ComfyNose at all and even appears to like the sensation of Mama extracting the stubborn offenders.We use this DAILY on our 6 week old baby who constantly has snots!My only complaint is that I wish there was some sort of filter on it.But it is simple to use and works every time!This thing is awesome!A little wierd, but awesome!Thank goodness he didn't have one when he was smaller....I can't imagine nursing round the clock when they can't breath!I bought this because the few times a day he does still nurse, he couldn't.He would get fed up because who wants to eat when you can't breath?Okay so it's slightly better than a bulb syringe but my baby hated this when I tried this on her!I think the extra space is just making you have to suck that much harder to create suction... not impressed for $14.They don't go beyond the tray like the bumbleride twin, they go down to the side of the tray closer to the child.I don't know why they don't show that in the photos.the only thing is that they don't go 'out' far enough so when you pull it down all the way it goes right in front of their face.(1 inch deep too).no cup holder.the other tray (for the '60' seat is about 2 inches wide and has two tiny round sections for a cup on each end.with a 4year old & a 2 year old the seats were plenty big enough.- MANEUVERABILITY:  I was hoping to be able to turn it & push it with my pinky finger (like i can with my bob revolution or my bumbleride twin).(happens with all strollers with double wheels in front).the 2010 model goes straight ahead.The scary part is that when you turn it, you can feel the whole frame twist like it's going to break.there is absolutely no blue on it anywhere.u.g.l.y.- FIGHTING:  there is no divider between the kids so they fight & have full access to eachother.Did I mention that the '60' kid has to share their extra cupholder with the '40' kid?they would be easily accessable too.too difficult to steer- bob double?$200, it's a beast.It I could afford the $680 stroller I would.So it's nice for my because my son is 3 and my daughter is 4 months, so the 60-40 split is wonderful!The canopy is great!!It's nice because I keep it like the picture for my son, and fold it all the way down for my daughter.My only complaint is that it's cheap.This is probably one of the lightest double strollers on the market (21 lbs).We where in the market for a double stroller that my wife could easily pick up and transport around.The canopies are big and it can fit a decent sized diaper bag underneath.We have a Bumbleride Indie Twin in our garage for trips to the park, grass and gravel.We have a Peg 30/30 and it's a bit tough to attach.It took only a few minutes to install these safety straps to our 46" Sony Bravia LCD and to the oak stand on which it sits.The design makes so much sense - and it's VERY secure for holding the pump flanges in place, and doesn't lose grip even when your bottles get full.It is very well-constructed and works perfectly!I do suggest you measure yourself prior to ordering to make sure you get the correct size.It has become am essential part of pumping for me.I'm not sure how it was intended to be worn.The material is perfect, I can imagine it lasting 100 years bit has some elasticity to it fnd it's well made.Washes very well.Aside from getting your sizing right, you can't go wrong with this.These work great!I like them but I am still looking for a less expensive quality replacement because of the cost.My daughter LOVES them.the one is a bath sponge so i can also use it to wash her.I'm surprised by the other good reviews of this cup.It does not mold to the forehead at all.and really you could use any old cup to rinse.It holds the perfect amount water and I am able to put it up to his head so I do not get any water in his eyes.Great price.I bought this hoping that it would keep the water out of my daughter's eyes in the bath, but it does not, it is simply not large enough.It is perfectly functional as a rinse cup though and good as a bath toy, it just doesn't sheild her eyes.This cup is made of soft plastic which is perfect for the tub.The size is just right and does the job very well.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!Granddaughter loves 'em.Colors bright, plastic is soft, and they fit easily into her hand.Would make a nice baby shower gift too.my 7 month old daughter just loves these in her tub at bathtime.they are the perfect size and are easy for her small hands to handle.they keep her occupied and she giggles when she gets squirted with them.highly recommended!My son loves chewing on these toys and splashing for them in the tub.I've regretted a lot of impulsive baby purchases, but not this one.So I like the price and they have cute colors.we got it when she was 6 months and since then they have been her companions not only for bathtimepaint stays on, and they have been chewed on!especially the penguin!you just have to remember to drain them after "swimming"-----------One year later:It is definitely time to get a new set,but it was worth it!My son loves these toys.The price is great too.Highly recommended!My son loves these bath toys.Its great how theres five of them to play with.The water flows from it freely.This is the perfect size for my baby, who started to eat cereal.When she progresses to eating fruit/vegetable, the compartments would be used.I think we'll be able to use it for a while, & think it's definitely worth the price.I think the best part is that he can easily grab the handle with his whole hand--and the handle's rubberized texture also helps with holding it.I have 6 month old twin girls.They suck the food off, continue to chew on it, and with the tighest baby grip I have ever seen, refuse to give it back to me!!!They think it's a game so we have a lot of fun with it.They both love it!This was a fun spoon at first before we got into serious eating... it helped her from sicking the spoon to far in her mouth.And you cannot choose the color.She loves flipping it around and testing it out in her mouth.I bought these primarily for the ability to store food in the fridge or to take on the go.They are fine and sturdy for holding the food, but the lids are thick and strangely inflexible.The suction cup is only on one bowl and you have to move it between bowls.This wouldn't be such an issue, but after moving it several times the suction has become warped and thus rendered unusable.The lids provide a nice secure closure, as well.I bought these when my 1 boys were sick and were having problems eating.They work great!For regular fruits and veggies stage 2 baby food it does the job.With this bottle I am able to give him his baby food fast and without the mess of him loosing almost all of it to his bib.There was NO way I would let my teething baby boy put it in his mouth!We bought this for our four-month-old baby girl.We love the reclining features and the secure harness.The colors are nice and neutral.We were very happy with our purchase.It was very easy to put together and very lightweight.It's lighter than the travel system we also considered.I also liked that it comes in neutral colors since we didn't know the gender of our little one.This is an excellent purchase for anyone looking for a trayless, durable, sturdy, adjustable-back booster.The back of the seat with harness can be set back to approximately 7.5" from the front edge of the seat, and further again to approximately 9".Our first child is still using it quite comfortably at 3 years old.Both of my children are average size and still have room to grow in these seats.Great purchase.I can still push in my chair under the table most of the way- and if this was a big deal, I could easily remove the back and just put it on top until using it.It is adjustable- which is good if you have a small baby.What I like most is that it is REALLY secure to the seat.(I would still advise constant supervision, but at least the seat won't be an issue).The straps seem sufficient- although they are not attached to the booster bottom- only to the back and then one strap goes under and through the legs of the child.The design is fine, but I do wish there was a little more softness or fluff to the back for comfort.My son kept on sucking on the straps and I had to wash the carrier all the time.I started using the sucking pads and now I only have to wash the pads...i still wash the carrier but not every time I use it.Cute, comfy and lightweight these are perfect for summer.They would be best for a boy or a unisex themed room.This beautiful set fits perfectly on any standard size crib [mine was from Babysrus].It's light & simple, but when the whole set is on your crib the pinks, browns, and whites are overwhelm-lying gorgeous.The bedding is extremely soft and perfect for a soft baby face.I have no complaints about this bedding and am sure it will brighten the girls room for years to come.The Pinzon Baby Crib Set is perfect for a nursery that is going for a clean understated look.Oddly, the quilt in this set is not something that you would have out on display...The bumper uses pink ties for fastening to the crib.... very impressive.- Crib Skirt - Matches the bumper - solid white with pink trim.Traditionally, the quilt is the "money item" in a crib set and for the price of this particular set you would hope that it was more display worthy.3 StarsIt is done in a subtle color combination of chocolate brown, a robin's egg blue, and creamy white.The crib sheet is primarily white with polka dots in the brown and blue color palette.The other three pieces are accented with a tasteful chocolate piping that contrasts with the white background.The construction is superior.The main composition is 200 thread count percale cotton.It has a soft yet sturdy feel to it.I bought a comforter in this fabricaion for my last child and it held up beautifully during its time in service.The overall design is contemporary and could work into virtually any decorating scheme.What I am particularly enthused about is the tailored bed ruffle.Gracefully understated in appearance, the Pinzon crib-set establishes a tone of dignity and beauty.It creates a soft, comforting atmosphere for your nursery.It is both aesthetically appealing and wonderfully durable.Moreover, it effortlessly compliments any type of furniture you have selected (but it is especially striking against an espresso finish).Pinzon offers a skin-cradling, two-hundred thread-count, lightly pastel-colored, gently-patterned fabric.It is timeless.(Such a boon for those parents who value a classic appearance over a trendy one).Is this crib-set a little pricey?Believe me, once you see this in your nursery, you will not regret your choice.Softer than you can imagine.Staggeringly elegant.Simply gorgeous.I have to say I do love the fact that the 200 thread count feels great.I am pleased with this baby bedding, as it is simple, minimalist, and can be matched with other cutesy bedding and accessories.I like the tailored look of the bedskirt, with the added benefit that it allows extra hidden storage under the crib.This set would make a nice addition to any nursery where you don't want to be locked into a certain "look" and can instead feel free to accessorize as desired.I am happy with it overall.This is a gorgeous crib set, with lovely craftsmanship and detailing.The seams are straight and sturdy, and they hold up great to washing.You can get extra sheets in different colors of dots to mix things up a bit, and the pink in this set isn't overwhelming or too sweet.The simple color scheme also makes it easy to accessorize with other blankets, sheets, and toys, and I fully expect this to hold up for as long as the crib is necessary.Update: The baby I got this for is now over a year old, and the crib set still looks great.I highly recommend the brand.PROS: This bag suites me very well - practical and stylish.It comes with a changing pad, stroller hooks, and a zippered pull out wristlet.The silver part is very soft, and the strap is wide and should be comfortable on my shoulder.(But it's great to have options!)CONS: The opening at the top could be wider.Front zippers are chunky and don't open/close smoothly.It's not so clear that the front pockets will be of much use once the inside bag is full.Quality is good, not great for the price.I knew i wanted a seat with good side impact protection and this one seemed to fit the bill.I like that the side impact headrests are easily adjustable and seem to grow with the baby which was my main complaint when looking at some of the others like Britax.Make sure that when you install that you pay attention to the recline bar which is up underneath the unit.I plan to keep my son rear facing in this seat for as long as his legs aren't in his mouth :)I will say that there is plenty of room on either side for medium sized passengers to sit comfortably.I had to use the towel like other reviewers; I don't see how you can properly install it rear facing without using a towel.It's a good looking car seat, the fabric is nice, and I am optimistic that it will perform well safety-wise but it sure is a tight fit and if you need to put it somewhere other than the middle seat you may want to keep looking.While I am now a pro at untangling straps, between the size of this seat, my daughter not liking it, and the strap annoyance I am going to take it back and getting a Britax.The seat is way cushier but still firm, the straps have not gotten twisted once yet, and my daughter just looks way more comfortable resting in it.Bottom line--I returned the Air Protect and am happy to have found my permanent new seat in the Advocate 70 CS.Thus, I was looking for the ultimate side impact protection to make up for mounting next to the window.Although the Clubman has an extra half door to make it easier to get in the back seat, I have to put our daughter in from a standing position -- outside and "behind" the (rear facing) seat.I have to lean over the seat to buckle her in / unbuckle her.That being said ...Pluses------1) The seat seems to offer the ultimate side impact protection.It has positions for front and rear facing, but not a fine enough adjustment: our daughter's head droops forward when she sleeps -- far enough forward that it is not between the air pillows; thus, there is no safety advantage if she falls asleep.We just bought aBritax Advocate CS Click & Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyxfor my wife's car (to replace the Graco bucket).It costs twice what this one did, but since that is the primary car seat our daughter will use for the next couple of years, it seemed worth the price.No need to undo straps or wake a sleeping baby.- The storage underneath is so big compared to a normal stroller.It is really easy to access things underneath even when the infant carrier is on top.- The cup holder and tray are very nice and sturdy.- It is lightweight and compact - easy to get in and out of the trunk of my car.The reason I didn't give it five stars is because it is not a necessity.You can definitely get by without one but if you have access to borrowing one or can find one used, it is a really nice and convenient thing to have.Baby can face forward or toward you.Even if it breaks today, I have gotten so much use out of it that I am happy.Works great with our Chicco car seat and is light and folds up very easily!I love the bright colorful prints on it too!Later on you can use it as a blanket.You can cut it and sew it into small pieces for burp cloths too!Needed some new teether and this one works great.I bought this as a stocking stuffer and I have been pleasantly suprised.She is 6 months old and loves loves loves to chew on the brush part.It is shaped perfectly for her little hand.My daughter loves to chew on this and when I put toothpaste on it, I can easily clean her teeth.My son hates having his teeth brushed, he is 8 months old and doesn't like anything near his face...So we thought we'd get him this to  help with some of the brushing, he definitely chews on it.He's got 6 teeth they are big and I'm always concerned he will get cavities and what not.Other that that, it fits our Georgia Dotty Graco pack 'n play perfectly.This fit my Chicco playard perfectly!The colors are super cute with the "adventure" playard.I needed to return.These were great.good quality and fit perfect.It's so soft and cozy, and my daughter slept THE WHOLE night with it in the pack-and-play while we were on vacation.I have yet to wash them because our baby isn't here yet.Fits perfect for our carters pack n play.UPDATE: My son is now 2.5 years old and he has used these sheets since he arrived.He frequently uses the pack n play so these sheets are perfect!They never shrunk, and they still look brand new almost 3 years later!I've been very impressed with the Carters line of Everyday Easy bedding, and this crib skirt is no exception.It fits well and looks beautiful on a full-sized convertible crib, and the texture is gorgeous paired with a velour sheet and bumper.The skirt held up beautifully in the wash and I was careful to air dry it before running it through the dryer on a gentle cycle to decrease wrinkles and avoid shrinkage.This is a really pretty, soft piece that fits in very nicely with boutique-style decor, yet is much easier on the wallet.The pad is fine I guess.The size of these is in the description, so not sure why someone expected larger?????These are PERFECT, I use them to lay on top of the fitted changing pad cover, they are waterproof and soft and hold up well in the wash.I had bought 2 and just came back to buy 3 more.LOVE THEM!Keeps the pad underneath clean.Wash very well.This particular one is the perfect size for using on a changing pad.Buy better quality prefolds to use, or just the flannel burp rags or recieving blankets.These fitted diapers with snaps have been a great step in the evolution of our cloth experience.No more handling dirty pins or snappis, and the ruffled legs really stop leaks.(and no, my child doesn't happen to have great smelling poop...:).Honestly this stuff is amazing.Beyond the most lovely scent, it has natural antibacterial properties, so I think it helps with diaper rashes.Also, I use it on my own hands after I change my baby (if a bathroom isn't nearby) -- I've even used this to clean the hands & faces of my older kids.Really nice.I always just spray it right on my baby's bum, then wipe with cloth wipes...works great!works beautifully on my baby's cloth-diapered bum...I wish it had a little bit cleaner smell, but it smells good enough, I suppose.No ointments, powders with or without zinc helped as fast as this miracle spray.My son is now nearly 18 months and smiles every time I spray this on him, which is very different from his screams of pain with regular disposable wipes (even the sensitive ones).Love this and so does my son.This is a great solution to spray on cloth wipes.I bought one bottle when my baby was born and 5 months later, still have half a bottle.It's all natural, so it's easy on the sensitive baby skin.It works GREAT!Kissaluv's Diaper Lotion Potion Concentrate is an ECOLOGICAL and ECONOMICAL way to help relieve (and prevent!)I much prefer using natural essential oils than chemical ointments on my baby; and the lovely scent really helps keep your diaper pail odor from overwhelming the room.We've even used the stuff to soothe ant and mosquito bites, and on occasion to create an extra-special bath.Great smell..Very concentrate so you dilute in a lot of water which is good cause this little bottle last about 6 months or more.These wipes started unraveling after the first wash without ever even being used!These are fantastic wipes.I bought the same wipes again for our second child.I like these wipes a lot and they are a great price.they size is perfect.My baby girl doesn't like it when I use these in certain areas.I plan to get some thinner flannel wipes to use alongside these.Also, some of the thread is coming off around the edge.We have three sets of these in rotation for our baby and love them!We use them at each diaper change and wash every couple of days; we haven't experienced any stains or wearing down of the fabric even with frequent use and washing.They will fit perfectly in the Prince Lionheart brand cloth wipes warmer, if you care to use it.They can also be used as doublers for a newborn inside a cloth diaper, or dustrags after baby is done with them.I bought 3 sets of these wipes after reading the reviews and thought I really liked these until my newborn daughter's skin started getting irritated from using these.My baby is 3 weeks old now and I've been using these since she was born and I noticed that the part of her butt that I would wipe the most is turning red and swollen.The terry is cheap and therefore not very soft.I've had to stop using these and am looking for a softer cloth wipe.I also use the organic Babykicks wipes, which are much better.Yeah, these Kissaluv wipes get the big mess job done because they're so coarse.A great, economical choice and a step up from prefolds.I use these in my FuzziBunz and BumGenius pocket diapers and they offer a nice, trim fit.Still, they work great and have maintained their absorbency.they do stay soft with time and are trim.I have used these doublers with both of my daughters starting from when they were a newborn.I can always tell when I have forgotten to put one in with my 4 month old, because she seems to show more discomfort with her wet diaper!=)  These have been great!My husband researches everything for months before he makes a purchase and after five months of research and trying at least two other cloth inserts, we have found our absolute favorite!Its perfect for diapering on the go for day to day use.I expected it to be larger.It's perfect!We love the look of it, and overall it works great for us.Pros:- Easily holds the Mia Moda Certo car seat.I like to use sheet savers for my son to lay his face on.They are also good for runny noses when sleeping.These are great!I have bought many different types and these are my favorite.They are perfect for delicate facial skin to be on, especially for a wiggler.These are soft and wash well.The are good to tie into a crib or lay in a bassinet.I received this item in pink.Also, as another reviewer mentioned- they seem small for the crib.These are great and just tie on, where you choose.They match our nursery wonderfully and have the water resistant underside.its easy to carry and can also be used for regular chairs.I was so happy to find an alternative to bumper pads for my daughter's crib.Pros:Easy to use and attachFoam filling cushions impact when heads bump against the railsSoft velvety/microfiber-like materialAttractiveReversible colorsStays in placeMachine washableCons:Exposed white zipper teeth, slider, and steps.Tedious to wash.Neutrals:All wonder bumpers are the same length of about two feet.As the only cushioned alternative to traditional bumpers, these command a hefty price.Fortunately, they perform the job needed.They're easy to attach to the 1.5" rails that I have, possibly even 2" wide rails by stretching just a bit, but not to larger corners.It can be zipped around a rail on either side.This will be useful for either gender babies.For those rails, the top part of the rails will be exposed, because of course we want the bumpers placed where the baby will actually bump its head.Since I have exactly 38 rails, I would need to purchase additional bumpers in order to stack two on top of each other if I was concerned about appearance.I'm not.The entire zipper is white, and is exposed.If I place the zipper so that it faces out, then the set doesn't look so great, but I can't have it face in, because I don't want zipper teeth marks on the baby's forehead.It's not so great that in order to wash them, I have to open the velcro flap on one end and remove the flimsy foam insert because that piece is not washable.I don't expect to be washing all 38 of them very often, though, and I think I'd prefer removing them over having warped foam fillings.Some other minor quality issues: There were a few loose threads on the bumpers, such that when I first opened the package, I wondered whether someone just slapped two pieces of cloth together with a piece of foam inside.My son was just moving to straw cups, so we tried these.Unfortunately, I don't love them.While I do love how super easy the straw part comes out and is easy to clean, all my 18mo toddler generally does with the cup is open and close it.My baby loves it, she looks comfortable, she sleeps hours in it, and it rolls really well.I'm 5'7 and my husband is 6'1, it's great for us and our height.It's been 5 months since I purchased this stroller and so far it's holding up.My only complaint is that the stroller is very bulky.I love my stroller but it's just not a practical choice.They were uncomfortable.I LOVE THIS!!!I was a bit skeptical about this product - it was a bit pricey for something we will probably only use once a month or so but, my son's safety is priceless.I was sold when a NYC woman wrote about installing the seat in less than 90 seconds in cabs; time is precious when you are getting in and out of cabs and horns are honking at you.The bag is fairly large (think bowling bag) but, there is a shoulder strap on the bag that does not show in the online pictures.AND it is a very tight fit even using a lap belt.After you have a tight fit you secure the back using the top tether.I found most Chicago cabs have the top tether anchor - even the cabs that look older.Every cab is different so to be able to install in such little time is amazing.This is a must-have if you live in a large city where you take cabs.If you own a car and are just looking for an everyday car seat - this is probably not for you.I love the large size- perfect for swaddling (even the BIG babies), as a coverup for nursing, over a stroller or just to snuggle with.A MUST in warm weather.I love these blankets.I purchased them becuase my 3 month old out grew the Miracle blanket but still needed to be swaddled to go to sleep.These blankets were perfect.They are huge but lightweight so they are not bulky or cause baby to overheat.I lay him on the floor with these and they are big enough for him to roll around on.They are great!We bought this for our newborn (before he was born) and they were absolutely perfect.He is a summer baby, and these were just soft enough (perfect after a few washings), and definitely big enough, and most importantly, breathable.He felt swaddled and cozy without getting too hot.I imagine these would work in winter too, in a warm house.Now he is four months and he still loves these snugglies (he didn't really like a tight swaddle by the way); they are like a sheet for him that we use under a heavier blanket.They are classy and quite large, so you can double them, doubling the weight and warmth, and they are still big enough and cozy.Everyone should have at least a couple of these blankies.These swaddle wraps are fantastic.You can swaddle in multiple ways because they are so large.I love all of the swaddlers by Aden & Anais.I have purchased several different ones and have been pleased by all of them.I find they wash well and dry well in the dryer.Great quality!hands down- best blankets ever!worth every cent- trust me!my son even loves playing with them- they are the BEST!These are great!My newborn has outgrown most of the blankets he was swaddled in before but not these!Swaddling blankets are a must have for anyone with a newborn.These blankets make the perfect wraps (use two so your little one doesn't escape!).They are soft, breathable, and cling to themselves so you can get a tight wrap every time.I would be lost without these blankets!i LOVE these wraps.my son is sleeping next to me swaddled in one right now.they are so soft and flexible, breathable and easy to use.very nice blankies, they quilt up after washing them a few times.great for warm weather.This is great blanket.There are two sizes so be careful if you want the bigger one.Very recommended!I just got these yesterday and couldn't wait to use them on my lil' girl.She's 6 months now and loved it!Love the colors and the design is really cute.This works great, is easy to clean, and is the perfect size.I get this as a gift for every baby shower I attend.In fact, it does a great job protecting my son from icky table germs when he is eating finger foods.Don't think anything without a suction cup would work at all for us.I love our Tiny Diner placemat!We have used this for over a year every time we go out to eat.This also keeps a lot of food from ending up on the floor or in his lap.We have had multiple waitstaff comment on what a great item it is.We give this as a baby gift all the time.I highly recommend it.Easy to wipe clean, or fold up and clean when you are home.Not too big, not small.We bought two of these for our 14-month-old twins to use when we eat out.The top kept rolling up.This is wonderful when they started eating finger foods and we would go out for dinner.The suction cups are strong enough to hold it in place, during a lot of rigerous pulling and tugging which was awesome because my youngest is always trying to yank it off.You won't regret it!I did not really like this item.I don't have to use a bottle brush, so there is no worry of microscopic scraps inside that might hold bacteria.The flow is perfect for him and the colors are nice.I love them!!And so does my son!You have to look closely at the pictures and be familiar with this brand to notice, but these bottles are not the anti-colic version.I love it.It works great and was very familiar for my daughter since she is used to the MAM bottles.The parts are all interchangeable with the MAM bottles as well, which is very nice.Only complaint is that it is a bit to "bottlish."), nursing pads are an essential part of the new mom's wardrobe; buy Kushies, and you'll be happy.).Here are the Kushies!Kushies Washable Nursing Pads, WhiteI'm on the contrary very satisfied with these nursing pads.If so, these pads are fantastic!make sure you do not poor to much water not more than recommended otherwise it will sick over.hits up fast.It does heat the bottle very quickly as advertised, but I think it heats unevenly because it heats the bottle so quickly.A useful baby item with attractive design.That being said, once my son decided he didn't like the soothies anymore and switched to the MAM pacis, it works perfectly.However, the sides dig into her cheeks and leave red marks (like red parentheses around her mouth).The curvature is difficult to see from online images.I love these pacifiers.I have a baby girl and was given these (blue/white and white/blue) as a shower gift.These are a pretty shade of blue and I don't think they look out of place on a girl- though I must admit I love the color blue to begin with.Since she was a newborn she has loved this pacifier the most; It stays in her mouth better than others we have.I also like that it doesn't have a ring like the other NUK's.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because like the other reviewer, this leaves marks on my baby's face.Sometimes, not always, she has red parenthesis-type marks next to her mouth.She doesn't seem to seem to notice or mind the marks.Overall, I love these!The one thing I didn't like about these pacifiers is they're made of multiple parts.Our daughter LOVES NUK nipples & pacifiers, but these are a pain in the rear to try to find in the middle of the night.Heck, they're a pain to try to find any time - even if she drops it in the middle of the day, if the pacifier falls with the red NUK face down, it literally blends in with whatever it's on.Go with the ones with color.Since the very beginning, my baby has had a difficult time keeping pacifiers in his mouth.He wouldn't even suck on it because of how different it really is.This may be because he was breast-fed for some time and switched to the Playtex Drop-In system...The nipples on those bottles are very big, but comfortable for my baby.Since the time we tried these, we have found that he is able to keep the pacifier in his mouth for extended periods of time with the MAM pacifiers, which I do recommend.Hope this helps!We were looking for something our son could chew on that was not made in China and have been beyond pleased with this product.It is super easy for him to grasp and is firm without being uncomfortable for him to chew on.My son is just over a year old and has been using the Nuk bottles since he was 2 months old.The Nuk sippy was wonderful because it is the same size at the bottle and all he has to adjust to is the different nipple.We love these sippy cups!I loved these at first....I hand wash all of my baby stuff so this isn't a heat issue it's a quality issue it's the latex.No more strange discoloring =]My son refused to give up breastfeeding.I had to wean him for several reasons and found he would hold out for HOURS, refusing many bottles after only two gulps.I bought the Nuk Learner cup, then purchased 3 of these because I can use them on the Nuk bottles.I love that I can use the bottles and just replace the bottle nipple with the sippy nipple.My one year old son is adjusting well.It says right within the title "Single Pack" and "Colors May Vary".And moving on...I got thees for a transition for my 4month old daughter.Most learning sippy cups only go up to 5oz.So this made it very easy for her to switch, since she was already used to holding the Nuk regular bottle on her own, the shape didn't change for her hands at all, only what she was eating from.No matter how many times I wash it, it is still there.My baby loves holding the cup, although she does not know yet how drink from it, but I am sure she will learn soon.It is lightweight and easy to hold.The cup is small.Also, although the description does warn "colors may vary," I didn't realize that the decorations were very gender specific.As a result, I ended up with a pink and red flowered sippy for my son.I LOVE this cup.These are great for starting a baby on sippy cups, but they just don't hold up.You have to be careful not to screw the top on too tight or too lose..Thought it might be just my cup, so I went and bought a differnt color, but.. same issue..Overall, since this is the only cup she will drink out of and the design is well made, I give it a 4...this sippy is wonderful.very easy to clean and not a lot of small parts to get lost.so it is great!This is a great learner cup.I tried to wean him from his bottle to this sippy cup without success.The nipple is a little different from his usual bottle nipple.Maybe I'll just introduce him to a regular cup with a straw.I tried 4 different cups before finding this one.When my son shakes the cup it doesn't leak either.The only time it leaks is if pressure is applied to the nipple when it's pinched, etc.It's definately not as leak proof as the sippy cups with the anti-spill inserts, but overall I am happy with it.So far, my son, 6 months old, enjoys it.The edges leak if it's not screwed on in exactly the correct way and the child can't finish all of the liquid in the cup due to a deep set top, where all the remaining liquid ends up sitting when the cup is turned to a drinking postion.They do the trick quite nicely.These cups are great!I bought one on Amazon... and they sent me a pink one.I was aware that "colors may vary".I bought these for my 1 year old to feed herself when she doesn't feel like eating finger food.The prongs are not sharp, yet they hold food pretty well.The price is right, and they hold up great in the dishwasher.Go down to Wally World or Bulls Eye and pick up a pack for about $4.00.They are also comfortable for me to hold if I need to feed my child.They are a good transition from baby spoons to adult silverware both in size and aesthetics.These are great toddler forks!They hold up great and I've never had one rust on me.We love the Graduates forks but for this one the spoon part is still a bit big for a 2 year old mouth .They are sturdy and don'd bend, we even scooped ice cream with one and it didn't bend.They come through the dishwasher great.We have some of the forks, spoons, and knives that have already gone through three of our children and are still in great shape.You get 2 in the pack.They are made in France (Yea!Not China!), and European safety standards are higher than USA's so you can be assured this is a safe product.I have to admit the spoons are extremely flexible and not firm/hard like us adults are used to using, but they are great for baby's first foods.The flexibilty, long handle, and softness are perfect for using in narrow containers as well as for baby's delicate oral cavity.At least it seemed so for my son.since it holds so little, but it does just come in a 2 pack so that good, you don't need a bunch at this stage.There are very few pockets, and they are small.I love love LOVE this wrap!My baby loves being in it and it works so well.I thought that it would be tough to figure out and wrap but it's super easy and with all the options they give you it makes it convenient to use at different stages.I found that even when I could bring the stroller it was easier to wrap my son up and carry him with me.It worked great until my son got to be about 18 pounds, then the stretchiness of the fabric meant he'd start to droop after a while and wasn't as comfortable to carry.At that point we moved to a soft structured ergonomic carrier.My little one needed to be held for pretty much the first 2 months of her life.In desperation I bought the Moby because of all the possible baby positions it boasted.I figured my daughter would at least like one of them.I love the stroller clips.Very happy with my purchase!I recieved this at the shower for my baby girl.We both enjoyed how it organized all the baby needs in one messenger type bag.So, I give this 5 stars for it's design, but ZERO stars for quality of construction.I was intrigued by the design (especially the front door access panel) and decided to try it since the Diaper Genie had given us so much trouble.The ease of use is fantastic!The pail is about the same size (height/width) as a Diaper Genie, and being 5'9, I don't mind the low profile at all.The front access door is WONDERFUL, and I can leave it open to easily air our the unit to prevent the smelly moisture.The self-contained bags that snap closed are super-handy.Especially since we live in the country and have to transport the bags to a dumpster in town to dispose of them.One pack of (10) refills costs the same as a (1) Diaper Genie refill, and they last about twice as long.Also, we've had the unit for 2.5 months, with one baby in diapers, and I haven't had to refill the baking soda dispenser yet.Putting the diaper into the unit is fairly easy; the lid is easy to open, and it takes about as much effort to push the diaper through the rubber fingers as it would to push it into a Diaper Genie.It's great!I bought this after my Diaper Genie II Elite BROKE!I loved how easy it was to dispose of a diaper in the Diaper Genie II Elite however it wasn't so easy to change out the liners.I'm very happy I took a chance and got this pail!Whenever you open it, a little baking soda is released into the air.This pail is relatively shorter than I expected but it is very simple to operate.It is not a complicated refill pack, but they are individual and need to each be snapped in.The baking soda is very refreshing and definitely keeps the smell out.I am not a fan either of how easy it is to open as you just click the thing on the front to open.My boys think it is funny to open it and pull on the bag or leave small toys in there.This unit works fine but I much prefer theDiaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System.This system isn't as effective at containing the smell and its got a smaller capacity.I don't have any major complaints about this diaper pail.I do wish I didn't have to FORCE it through, because again - with extra messy diapers it is not convenient.Luckily, it has remained in tact and has not broken after several months of such use, so that is good.Overall, it's pretty darn good.I haven't noticed any diaper smells AT ALL and I love that it can hold 25 diapers (about 3-4 days worth).It also has a somewhat small footprint, and the white color isn't too bad.However, as other reviewers have mentioned, the "squish" factor is probably my least favorite thing about it.My baby (11 months old) has managed to get the lid open multiple times so be aware it CAN be opened by a baby.I haven't actually had to replace the bags myself (hubby gets diaper duty) but he says it's easy (and I haven't heard any swearing while he does it, LOL) so maybe I will try it one day soon.I believe the price point is just about right for this item, so overall I would recommend this diaper pail if you decide you want to use a diaper pail.I am giving this item four stars because I think it is much better than the other options out there, but it could still stand to improve a bit.Each bag lasts 2 to 4 days with size 2 diapers depending on how well I roll them up and how many diapers she goes through.If it gets too difficult and I don't have time to change it out, I usually leave it open so I don't break it by trying to force it and so that it reminds me the next time I walk by and do have time to change it.I also like that the replacement bags are not too expensive (in my opinion).I like that the bags are easy to insert and remove and that they seal when you take them out.I like many parents have used many different brands of diaper pails at my own home and homes of family and friend.This one is pretty nice and does a good enough job at holding dirty diapers.The one we have had for almost four years (Baby Trend) takes a fair amount of abuse which was one of the reasons we bought/registered for it.This one is nice.It is an open, drop, and close.I don't think the baking soda sprinkle is really needed.Parents, especially those with newborns, know that it doesn't take long to get to 25 diapers.As diaper pails go this one is pretty nice.Just take the stay fresh seal off of the baking soda and you're in business.Not sure if it helps, but it is cool.It's part of the odor control gadget but it's still a bit tricky at times.Lock on the door is NOT kid proof.The noise scares my daughter.After using this for about a month, I am pleased to say that I am overall happy and it is a better diaper pail than my current one, which is a Diaper Champ.Now the longer I am a parent, the more I am convinced that this battle against poopy smells is  futile.I liked the baking soda dispenser at the top.I also like that I can throw wipes into it as well without clogging it up.(With the Diaper Champ we had to have a separate trash can solely for the wipes.)The first being I have to use  two hands, one to open up the pail and one to shove to diaper down.Maybe someone else has figured out how to use only one hand but so far, that has eluded me.The box says 25 diapers before you have to change it but that's just if they're newborn size.This is a pretty good Diaper pail for the money.I really haven't used a diaper pail in the past so this one pretty much seems well worth the money to me.I am really not in a habit of collecting dirty diapers for long so this does seem to force me to do that...that is make me lazier...because I would just empty my thrash every day.That said..It is fairly easy to operate.The put in and remove the bagsThe baking soda does do a good job soaking up  the strong odors.The bag compartment is a little easy for my toddler to reach and open which is not a great idea.But compared to all the other diaper pails out there its much cheaper n effective.It served its purpose just fine until my daughter started eating real solid foods.It even held up through her short-lived baby food period.My friend, who also had the DC, recommended this one.When you would walk in her daughter's room you could smell the poop so I figured if she said this pail was a marked improvement over the DC then it had to be good.It's better than the DC but when you open the top to put a diaper in there is definitely a lingering odor.It certainly is not as long lasting or intense as the DC but it's there.All in all, this is a better pail to the DC, and from my research the DC was better than the Diaper Genie, but at the end of the day once kids get to solid food you're on a whole new level of stink and I don't think any pail can mask that unless you put each diaper in it's own individual scented bag before throwing it away!I rated it a 4 because I think it's above average to other pails.I have had it for over a year now and I still love it.The bags that it uses are heavy duty and I have never once worried about them ripping or tearing.I know that most people don't like the whole "pushing the diaper all the way through part" but it's really not a big deal, and not messy.Also the baking soda "sprinkles" is a good idea expcept for the fact that it needs to sprinkle a bit more each time to be effective.I have yet had to refill the baking soda container (and yes I know I should have switched it out with fresh baking soda by now) because it hardly uses any.The good part of the frequent changes is that smells do seem to be kept mostly away.So, overall, it works.The lid is a pain to shut.), but we have to fight the lid a lot.It's not pleasant fighting to close the lid with one hand while trying to keep a crawling baby on the changing table with the other hand.I love it!Detailed descriptions below...The Munchkin:1) There are major issues with the lid.Crack...crack crack...crack...  You will live in constant fear of a late night gun battle playing out in the child's room leading to a screaming sleepy cranky baby.Even if the lid works correctly you still have to shove the diaper through the rubber teeth.You can not just drop a diaper in, instead you have to jam it through the teeth.How is that better than dropping a diaper into a bucket?3) What's the deal with the bags?A) I wondered what would happen if I re-used one of the Munchkin bags.The level of baking soda dropped into the bag when you close the lid is minor and the baking soda compartment is totally closed off.I dropped diapers in it for 5 days without emptying it.Half the time it was nice out and we had the windows open.Why would you want to keep that stuff inside a nursery anyway?Another factor to consider is the cost.This item is not perfect, but it does have some serious advantages.Item is overall a great value.This item is just ok.It has great little compartments for your own snacks, and I even use it for condiments for salads.I bought these for my 14 month old daughter since she is starting to feed herself.They are adorable.I love this set.I bought one set for each of my two children (ages 2 & 4) and they love them and request them.The quality is excellent, the design is sleek and timeless.I really like the size.These plates and bowls are sized correctly for the amount of food a young child should be consuming.Highly recommend!I really like these diapers and they work very well.The econobum prefolds also work great with my Flip diapers and I'm able to mix and match both systems together.Overall I'm really happy with this system.I love this damn toy, and so did my twins.I'd say we went through about 5 ourselves and have given about 3 as gifts.Very poor plastic construction, both blue pieces don't fit together perfectly.Big crack in the middle.This part is important because the seat collar goes around it.If there is crack, the seat won't rotate!I tried to rotate the seat collar around, it only moves with great adult force.The piano makes different sound, and the songs are more lively...not classical music (which I am already tired of, almost all toys play classical musics).It will be perfect if the main pieces are nicely molded to fit perfectly so everything runs smoothly.My son is three now.It's still as good of shape as when we first bought it.I bought this item when my son was about 5 months old.He also loves sliding the frog from side to side to see the dragon fly spin around.There's another frog with little balls inside that spin around when you push it down.After he was done with the seat, I was hoping that he could use it as an activity center by standing or playing with it from his knees.That was fine when he was sitting and could shift the top piece but now that he's pulling up to standing - if it shifts he tumbles to the ground.It would get 5 stars from me if it would fully lock into place.Other good things: lots to do - 4 full different "stations", breaks down to smaller pieces, sturdy base, rotating seat.Other no-so-good things: the seat is HUGE (we had to load w/receiving blankets to stabilize).Hope that helps!Bought the Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station (Tropical Fun) for my 5 month old son last week.I would definitely recommend the ExerSaucer over this Activity Station.I bought this for my 5 month old, but my nearly 3 year old loves it also!I really like how my little one can spin completely in the seat!I also love that she can walk all the way around the activity center.My little one loves to push the music buttons- the exciting thing for me is there are "book" pages that turn and depending on which page the "book" is open to the music or sounds change!It is sturdy for my little one, but I would love if it could hold more weight.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.Even to this day, this swing has done its job wonderfully.As my baby started growing, carrying and rocking him all the time started giving me back pain.There are also two positions in which you can recline the seat - a semi-reclined and a fully-reclined position.Although we haven't brought it anywhere else yet, the swing doesn't take up that much space once it's folded so I can't see any real issues moving this swing around.It does the trick, only my son doesn't like it.Fortunately it can take a few beatings like that.He just wants to be held instead:)I am so thrilled with this swing, I researched forever it seems to find the perfect portable swing and this one has been great.This is a wonderful swing, very cute for boy or girl and my baby has loved it since day one.I love the safety harness that keeps her from falling out when she starts squirming and the automatic timer.Excellent good quality material that I highly recommend!son still fits well in this swing, without any struggle.Truly is whisper quiet operation.My son is now 5 months old (17lbs) and we just purchased the bouncer.We had a fisher price rainforest one previously, but it was getting uncomfortable for my son, so I decided to buy this one.I love the fact that it reclines and sits forward, even though when it is forward it seems like it may lean too far.If my son wasn't buckled in, he would be able to fall right out (but I believe it is because he is very tall)He absolutely loves napping in this bouncer, it is very comfortable... and he could sleep for hours!I received this item as a gift so fortunately I was able to work out the minor issues before the baby came home.First, let me say, it's adorable, super soft and cozy.It was very easy to put together and the color is exactly that of the picture.However, I give a big thumbs up to their customer service department.I finally just kept it off, which was fine.Overall, this was an excellent gift and I love it!We love its angle, and he seems to like the music and vibrations.I purchased this bouncer for my newborn and he seems to be pretty happy with it.My one and only complaint is that it seems to really chew thru batteries.As a first time mother, I cannot speak from much experience, only what I have seen with this one bouncy.This seat is VERY soft and cuddly- which is my favorite feature.The vibration is nice and gentle and the music is fine, though nothing special.We have twins, a boy and girl, and so have purchased both the pink and the neutral Comfort & Harmony bouncer.Before finding the Comfort & Harmony, I have never been perfectly happy with any of the ones I've used.The best features of this bouncer seat:-Toy bar that does not pop off every time you move the seat to a different location, and it EASILY slides back out of baby's face when you want to pick him/her up.-Two positions - works for newborns who need to lie almost flat and for older babies who want to look around.Most basic bouncers do not have this feature.-"Bounce mechanism" is different than most seats - it bounces from the back instead of having a seat attached to two bars that bounce from the bottom of the front bar.This means the baby bounces up and down gently (good for newborn) instead of back and forth (NOT good for newborn's head and neck position).-Removable cuddly, soft cushions and head support.Other than their cradle swings, these are very comforting and sleep-friendly!This swing is not only super adorable but very functional!It's very light and easy to move around.It's extremely quiet.great swing and the price is descent.we have the 'my little lamb' full size swing, which we absolutely love!but we keep it upstairs next to our bed and i wanted one downstairs for during the day so i thought this would be perfect.there isn't a dial to turn it up and down, just two buttons, loud or quiet.it's not shaped in a cup shape to hold baby.If you are looking for portability then this is a great swing, but keep in mind that NO travel swing will be as powerful as a full-size model.We have the full size Fisher Price papasan and the ocean wonders swings, and they were amazing and plenty powerful - colicky babies prefer vigorous swinging to soft rocking.I wouldn't want that strap rubbing on my skin, so imagine having that rub on baby skin?We have a newborn son who does not like this swing.The music is cute if not a little quiet, and it swings pretty fast which is great.Many children probably love it.He loves to grip the legs and rings, and the music is a never-fail way to stop tears and bring a smile to his face.to our son around 3 months and he just loved this toy.It's soft, no hard edges and I feel safe letting him play with it while I do something else.It works great in restaurant high chairs too, pretty simple to use, here the straps work great.I got two of these to use for our cloth diapered baby: One for the wash, while the other is lining the pail.I got a cheap lidded trash can from a department store as our pail and this fits in it perfectly.Holds the day's worth of diapers and it's waterproof.I'm cloth diapering my lo, and after 3 months of use they are both falling apart.Today I found the elastic edge completely unraveling.Perfect amount and various sizes of pockets.The reason for this is because I don't like to carry a separate purse and diaper bag.I loved the accessories: the pacifier holder, wallet, and great oval shaped changing pad.I give it two stars for the super changing pad, but I am quite disappointed with the functionality of the bag.This bag is so stylish that no one will believe it is a diaper bag.This bag is a standout and I guarantee you'll get compliments.It is also quite large and appears functional with several large pockets inside and two external pockets as well.The inside pockets are not contoured enough for bottles so i have to stuff other thing around them to keep them upright and then they fall over anyway.I know that's not the most important consideration for a carseat, but if people didn't consider what the pattern was, manufacturers wouldn't have so many.It doesn't have one of those inserts for newborns, so if you were to put a newborn in, they would look, very, very small and although the straps keep the baby in place, it's always nice to have a little extra something to make them feel snug.Back to the Combi double stroller...it's a side by side, and with twins I realy wanted a stroller that would accomodate 2 carseats, and there's no way this was going to work out.The stroller will accommodate 1 carseat, but not very safely.In addition, the carseats are too big for even one carseat to fit on one side and not take too much space from the other seat.I have a 2 year old as well, so if he were to be sitting on one side and the carseat was installed on the other, he would constantly have to lean away to the outer side of his spot.I think Combi makes some great stuff, but this wasn't a winner for us.We really wanted to be able to use the infant seat for the full first year of our babes life, so the fact that we can go up to 33 inches and 33 pounds was an awesome feature.All the straps are super easy to adjust and we love the fabric.Everything is very easy to adjust, including the rise and length of the straps.My son is very comfortable in this seat and we will probably be able to use it until he is well over a year.After much research and asking friends, we left our beloved Graco and Britax and chose a Combi seat for our new baby.The buckle is a "puzzle buckle" and let's just say it makes me want to throw the seat in the river.5.The way it works with the matching stroller is insane...poor design makes it hard to get in and out of the locking mechanism6.See #5 for the base, too...Clicks into base just fine but getting it out is like unscrewing a medicine bottle...push down while simultaneously pulling up7.We still use it, but it's now lopsided like someone sat on it.I do have one good thing to say...the fabric is easily washed and washes beautifully.We also tried the portable model.If I could I would give -5 stars for both models.I really like this night light - very usual with the color changing function.My kids love it!We have owned the Mobi Tykelight, the Mobiglow and now the wallmate.I am very pleased with the wallmate.It is nice and bright but not too bright for my afraid of the dark boys.It appears to be sturdy as well.I'm really disappointed that I didn't find that out until I got the package, and now I have to return it.Reviewers loved Easy Stroll, you could move the stroller with ONE HAND!We also LOVE that CONT.@[...]I put my son down for a nap and he woke up soaked.I have not had any leaks.-The construction of the diaper is very good.They smell fine when they are clean but the second my kids pee in them I become very aware of the smell.These create the most pungent amonia smell I have ever experienced in CDing.-While these work very well for girls, they are not so great for boys as they get narrower toward the front.I loved the Gro Baby diaper system and was sad when they changed over to gro via.But i bought one shell set to try it out and they have made great improvements!Ok, I HATE the color, but the carseat itself is wonderful!He can see out the window and seems to be very comfortable.I'm really pleased with this purchaseI have twins so rather than get 2 things the same, I got this and a Jumperoo.I think they'll be too tall by the time the seat is a good fit which makes the Jumperoo my favorite.My 5 month old twins love this exersaucer.At 4 months, they didn't bounce in it, but at 5 months my son is starting to enjoy that feature.If you follow the instructions, it is easy to put together.My sister insisted on buying this exersaucer for my 4 month old son even after I had purchased a jumparoo for him.It's a nice change because now that he is 6 months old I have this saucer upstairs in his bedroom so some mornings if he wakes up earlier than we do, I can put him in his saucer to play.It keeps him happy and occupied for some time so I can catch a few more "z's".The good:  My 6 month old baby boy loves to rock out in here.Also, because he's still pretty lightweight it seems top-heavy if I put it on the highest setting AND it also seems uncomfortable because then he is "hanging" from his hips too much and not actually practicing standing -- so actually i put it on the middle setting and just sit right next to it and watch very very carefully to avoid any chance of him accidental flipping it.(He can definitely really get it rocking and rolling!)My son loved jumping up and down in it and it was his favorite toy for a while.Once he started standing and walking, he didn't want to be restricted and would fight me as I'd try to put him into the walker (however, he liked to stand and play with it - I used it as a blockade between a wall and sofa).Our six-month old LOVES this!!!My only complaint is we didn't get this sooner!Each time we put him in it he gets just a little bit stronger - it is great for helping him with balance and fine motor skills!He can bend most of the toys towards himself - which he loves!Bonus, he can bounce up and down because there are springs inside.Bought this for my 9 month old daughter to use when we travel to friend's houses or places where we don't want to hold her the whole time.This keeps my daughter amused for quite a while and allows us some time to relax.We started our four month old on solids using these spoons.Also, we noticed after feeing our son orange foods that the edges of the spoons are becoming stained.The are soft flexible and not too big for their little mouths.All in all, I would recommend it anyway because I found them to be most comfortable spoons, but you need to change them after a while.The nice shape of the spoon is very compatible for baby's mouth (this was the reason I bought these).My complaint is that the soft spoon part changes color after usage.My daughter loves the texture of the hair, which is strips of fabric.The tentacles are nice for chewing on.The rings are probably his favorite part of this toy because they are easy to hold and he can chew on them.I already have Jacques the Peacock and my son absolutely loves it so I figured I would get another Lamaze toy, I was quite hesitant to get Captain Calamari because out of all the Lamaze toys it had the least amount of reviews, but my son can't enough of him!It holds my sons interest for a while.The ball attached makes a rattle noise which is cool.this is more adorable in person.very fun and interactive too.so many noises and different textures.He makes lots of noise even for infants too small to coordinate their movements.He is on the larger side for a hanging toy and we've had to be creative about where we put him.The felt just doesn't look the same.Overall I'm happy with it because my daughter loves it.My 2 month old loves it.The 'seatbelt' is very substantial and toy loops and pockets are great additions.Not sure if it is really worth paying twice as much as other covers but I am happy with it overall.I just got this cover last week and already I have used it nearly everyday!It is wonderful and I consider it a must have.I have also used it twice on highchairs in restaurants within the past week and again I am so happy I have it.I like that it has it's own strap so you don't have to use the dirty ones attached to the shopping cart or highchair.It's pretty easy to put on but I think I still need some practice doing it one-handed, so far I haven't been alone when I've used it so I have had someone who could hold my son while I cover the cart/highchair.I bought this pillow because it was one of the tallest ones out there and I am a very high-waisted person with a very tiny baby.This one's pretty but the second I took it out of the Amazon box the front photo frame fell off.We have multiple strollers, one of which includes a double side by side stroller that we love, however, it's not always practical to use a stroller.Or, trips to the park with my 2 year old who wants to run everywhere.Dragging a stroller through the sand/tanbark was horrible, and holding the baby in my arms or in the sling wasn't practical because I often need my hands/arms to help my son around the playground and getting in and out of those bucket swings.I really didn't want a hiking backpack because I just don't need all of those darn straps, pockets, zippers, etc.The things I love the Kokopax City Carrier are:baby loves being able to look aroundlightweightno waist strapminimal pockets (just one that the straps feed into.That's the best way to carry a baby when they are over 6 months old.I had one like this one when I was raising my kids, it was wonderful.Absolutely the best!They peek everything you do so they don't get bored.They are comfortable, enjoying and even interacting with the environment, safely.I bought this one because it was extremely cheap, compared to the ones with a waist band, but ordered separately a back pack replacement waist band that fit it.This is the only lock that fits our fancy schmancy odd sized toilet.I like the high tech buttons you need to press to release it, and I like the ultra sticky tape (it's very important to have super strong sticky tape.In our master bathroom, we've taken the latch off because it's flown off way too many times by our slamming the lid down.Now we just keep the door to the master bath closed.Works well, just don't forget it's attached to the lid!Thanks to a certain airline which shall remain nameless, the canopy of our Kolcraft Tour Sport umbrella stroller (or lightweight stroller) was lost during an East coast trip.A big floppy hat was the solution until I spotted this replacement, which has turned out to be a bit of a bust.Although it's nice and big, and does create a Conestoga-wagon-like tunnel of shade when attached to our stroller, it's really meant to extend an existing canopy, more than substitute for one, because of its size and shape.These ties and the rather floppy (albeit framed) construction of the canopy itself are magnets for those curious little fingers, so the boy is constantly pulling at something or bending it or ducking under it, sitting on it, rolling over it, etc.I just bought a Graco Twin IPO stroller, and I needed the extra shade, but I didn't want to spend 55.00 on one shade.I bought 2 of these and they fit just fine side by side.It is a wonderful price and a great quality.The front wheel was a bit off till it got broke a bit, but works wonderful now.If it wasn't for the problem I had with the front left wheel wobbling every time I would go over a crack in a sidewalk when I first purchased it, I would have been a very happy camper.I will say this...their customer service is excellent.Strangely, by the time it arrived the stroller had miraculously fixed itself.Sometimes though when I back the stroller up and then try to go forward it takes me a few tries before the wheels properly align so that I can move forward.My son is 2 1/2 years old and it is too snug on him.That aside, the bottom part of the strap, the three point harness is a good size and width so it is sufficient.Now the pros....now that the wheels are working it really is a smooth ride.I used to have a Maclaren and hated it because of how bumpy the ride was going over crevices in the sidewalk, etc.So I'm really pleased with this.Also the built in parent console is awesome.I don't mind that the size of the canopy is fairly small because I have a sun visor that I slip on it and I get full coverage.Don't expect much from the basket...it's really small.Overall not bad for the price you pay and my son seems very comfortable in it.Not everyone experiences this issue, but I do know a couple of other reviewers who did.The excellent customer service compensates for this issue though.No problem, though, it was easy to follow their instructions to push a button and pop it off.I bought this to replace a larger Jeep stroller that I had for many years.I wanted something lightweight and portable because I travel, but also sturdy enough with good storage.This fit the bill for me.The basket underneath can be tricky to get into.It does hold cups, but because it is fabric it isn't very shockproof.So, make sure you have a lid, or something that closes.The brakes are easy to use.It folds easily and is lightweight.Nice and easy to use.The wheels arent as smooth but not terrible and the "canopy" is good for nothing.again, does the job as a quick and easy stroller.I couldn't cross the street with it as it became dangerous having to stop in the middle.I sent an email to the company's customer service and they have not responded.I really love this stroller!It is perfect for my height (5'6"), as others I have tried are too short.It is fashionable; I really love the colors!It has a small basket underneath, which can hold a few things also.Everything else I love about this stroller makes this worth it!LOVE THIS STROLLER!!!It was on the cheap end of the group I was looking at and works wonderfully!It's the perfect height for me, we haven't tried adjusting the handles- haven't needed to.The parent tray is a very nice touch.I absolutely love this stroller.I'm actually becoming a fan of the First Years brand.I have the Wave stroller for regular walks with the baby, but as great as it is, it's kind of a pain to take anywhere.The Ignite stroller is wonderful.I was also a little disappointed with the color - the red is kind of muted red (not like the pretty red on the Wave) and looks a bit depressing.My 3yr old (37" and 29lbs) says that she is comfortable in this stroller.You can really get this stroller moving.2) It's really easy to fold up, unless you have flip flops on... then you need to be careful when closing.3) Turns great.The front wheels do not get hung up and stuck when turning (Combi does).4) The stroller does not get stuck if there's a crack in the sidewalk (Combi).Very smooth ride for me as I do not have to fight the stroller.5) Sun shade is too, too, too small.There is a wide opening in the back, even with the seat in the full upright position, which allows sun to hit my very fair daughter.I purchased a Ray Shade from Babies R Us for $15.99 to keep the sun out.I purchased one from Babies R Us for $7.99 because my daughter is used to having one (Combi) and I don't want to be stuck in the loop of taking her cup out of the parent cup holder, giving it to her, and then putting it back into the parent cup holder over and over again.7) There are NO mesh pockets.I checked the entire box, opened from both ends, and there are no mesh pockets any where.Great customer service!8) The bottom basket is decent remembering that this is an umbrella stroller and not a full size stroller.I would consider the decline to be just leaning back versus laying down.Overall, a good umbrealla stroller for $51.00 plus the $24 in accessories for it.I just received this stroller.Her head does not brush against the top of the canopy.I love the parent console, it seems durable.The maneuvering seems great too.This was my next choice and it was only under $60!Overall I think it's a great umbrella stroller for the price.I just wish it had a stroller strap to carry when folded.I purchased this stroller because we had to leave our "The First Years Jet" at home when I went to live with family while my husband was deployed.I absolutely loved the Jet, but I thought the Ignite would be slightly better (more comfortable ride etc.)Unfortunately, I do not have time to order the Jet and return the Ignite, so we will just have to improvise!**Except for the canopy** the pros and cons here also describe "The First Years Jet" version we started with:Pros:- looks very nice and well built (the Khaki color is attractive and great for warmer/extremely sunny climates)- is VERY easy to push and turns quickly- +TALL HANDLES+ and great design keep me (5'7") my husband (5'10") and my father (6'1") from having to bend while walking or kick the wheels like in most small strollers!- the *5-point* harness keeps my active little guy from trying to play with the wheels while moving like in other small strollers!- the ride is nice for both child and parent- the seat has more cushion (a bit more on Ignite than Jet).Other small inexpensive strollers usually just have a board on the bottom with some fabric over it.- the recline is far enough back for sleeping/resting children.- VERY easy to assemble...(maybe 5 minutes if you include the unwrapping time) just pop on the wheels and snap the canopy on, and you're good to go!- super light and easy to fold/unfold and store.- does not take up much space in the car.- great price (Jet was about $20 less).- nice little parent console - can hold some extra toys, snacks, etc.- storage on bottom holds a small (size of a large purse) diaper bag and the ergo carrier easily.Cons:- Canopy does not adjust (on Ignite)- Storage on bottom is not very easy to access due to the frame criss-cross in back so you have to get creative sometimes.I have nothing to complaint about.The material is perfect and very good quality .I am planing to travel overseas with my boy when he is 15 month old "God willing", and this stroller will be my friend through the trip.Go for it you will not regret it.Wow, I didn't expect to get such a great quality stroller for around $50!I am 5'5, my husband is 6'1 and we both feel comfortable pushing the stroller.Also when we walk we never hit the wheels with our feet because of the way this stroller is made.- rubber wheels - smooth ride.This is really great for a lightweight stroller.- easy umbrella style fold.Very comfortable and well made.It is same as in our expensive BumbleRide 2010 Indie Twin Stroller I was really happy to see that because it is so easy to close and open!- Great style!I am very happy with the purchase!It's very sturdy and looks great too.I love that it's sturdy but not huge.I have been looking for a portable/ compact stroller for a few months now.This stroller is just want I needed- easy to fold up, compact, weighs only 14 pounds, reasonable storage options and comfort for my son.While my son is only 8 months old, we can use this until he is 50 pounds.This stroller is really very nice.It rides smoothly and folds easily.The only issue I have with it is the fact that you Cannot fold the stroller when the seat is facing the parent.You have to remove your child and turn the seat to face away from you before you can fold the stroller down.Otherwise this is a really great stroller.I'm 5'8" tall and it's perfect for my walking stride, no kicking the stroller at all and the basket below the seat has plenty of space.If you could fold the stroller with the seat facing the parent without having to turn it facing away from the parent I would have given it the full 5 stars.It's a GREAT stroller for those of us who can't afford to spend the extra hundreds for a Bugaboo, etc.I've only had this stroller for a couple of days, but I love it so far.I wish the handlebar was adjustable.You have to take the seat off to get a good fold.I'd say its a good stroller from birth to 2 yrs, maybe 3 yrs, depending on height.Overall, this is a great stroller.I loved that you can have the child facing you or out and being able to adjust the angle is really nice.The foam is already starting to show some wear and tear and we have had this stroller for under 6 months.The footrest has to be out for the stroller to fold up when the seat is on.My son loves it to be all the way down.Perfect for newborns!-It comes with like a fanny pack on the handle bars- I love it!!!It has tons of compartments.My diaper bags also have stroller clips- so I clip it to the sides of the stroller below for extra security.-Stroller colors are great and perfect for a boy.He can probably fit comfortably up to 20 pounds.)The sun hood was a dream to operate.The ability to switch from back to front and back again was incredible!!!!But then again I had seen some slick pictures online of people who figured out more streamlined ways to fold it.That did work out perfectly.Overall - I would buy this stroller again in a heartbeat.It was great!!I am glad I was able to sell it when I did - as I love my BOB revolution for an older child (1 year and up) but it would have been nice to keep this one too :)_________I started researching strollers this time around because I wanted one that had the newborn bassinet feature but couldn't bring myself to pay the $800 for the Uppa Baby (which looks beautiful but my husband gave me the evil eye when I told him the price :).I was SO HAPPY when I found this stroller for 1/4 the price!We bought the black one and the fabric looks great.It was very easy to put together and the turning function is incredibly smooth and easy to do (from forward facing to parent facing).I also love that you can have it sideways too, great for at a restaurant.Even my 7 year old could do it and found it fantastic.The biggest deal for me in any stroller are the hood size and the turning.5 year old in the stroller and pushed her all around the house, in circles, etc.This stroller was still VERY, VERY easy to push.Everything was smooth.So for fun I put my 56 lb.7 year old in it as well (I know this is above the recommended weight :) and it was still easy to push!!!!The storage basket is on the small side (and I have owned 7 strollers).in one of the parent pockets in my diaper bag.I give them that.Speaking of that feature it is GREAT that this metal frame can be used with our Graco Snugride carseat!Again, I wish you were able to attach your carseat into this stroller without having to remove the seat and install the carseat adapter but it seems this is the trade off for that bassinet feature I wanted so much.I believe I will be really, really happy with this stroller and will update when baby comes and I have had a chance to use it more.***EDIT 8/22/11***After about six months of use I ended up selling this stroller.As my son aged, he hated being somewhat reclined.In Urban, the black fabric really wasn't as nice as I would have liked.However, now that my son mostly wants to face outward at the world (1 year), it doesn't matter.I ended up choosing the Uppababy VistaUPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Cole/Slatewhich really has been a dream come true.It has every feature I could ever want, along with the price tag.Maybe in future models.It is still a great buy depending on what you're looking for.The stroller has held up well with almost daily use.I still think this stroller was a GREAT purchase for the price.I have been so pleased with all the features I purchased it for (reversible, bassinet to toddler, etc.)Not that it is important, but just to give you an idea, it looks like a more expensive and unique stroller.PERFECT fit!It is very easy and fun to do also!Pop on the wheels, the canopy, and the seat.For the price of the stroller though, this is minor.I was worried about the straps and the fabric looking too windbreaker-like, but it is more like a woven nylon, and softer than I expected.2) The basket is the reason I rated this stroller only 4/5.It is difficult to tell from the pictures, but there is a hardware part of the stroller than extends directly down from the frame and into the basket a couple of inches.This makes getting anything larger than a small purse or a blanket very difficult to get in OR out.Storage is a BIG deal for parents so this is disappointing.I suspect when the baby is older he will be outward facing anyway, and this won't be a problem, just something to be aware of.3) The strap system for the seat recline is cumbersome.I'm sure they could have figured something else out here.Hopefully for those that buy it later they will revise that in the following models.The two part fold is not difficult.The seat did come with a fairly strong fabric smell but after leaving it out in the living room for a few hours it has already started to subside.This helps to keep the bassinet seat stable and the seat keep its shape when put upright.We will probably be using this stroller when we don't need to pack around as many things or when I am alone with the baby so I can more easily see him and entertain him.I'm happy with the purchase.I debated on it for days and took the plunge; you should too.Hope this helps!When my daughter got older (around 7-8 months), she decided she no longer liked riding in the Wave stroller, she much rather prefered her First Years Ignite (umbrella) stroller because the seat back can be adjusted much higher.So, off stroller went for sale  :)  I have no regrets though, it was a much better arrangement for her than having her sweat and steam in the car seat travel system in the middle of summer with her head flopping to her chest when she was tiny.I've owned numerous strollers over the years, and this is by far the best stroller out there.I have three kids between the ages of 3 months to 4 years.The bassinet feature is amazing for my baby....it's so comfortable and cozy.My 18 month old loves that he can face me and chat with me while we are walking.And since this stroller goes up to 50 lbs i can even use it with my 4 year old if we really got in pinch.It's unbelievably easy to turn the seat from front to back.This stroller has all the features of the $600-$1000 strollers out there, even more in fact, and it looks every bit as nice.I would highly recommend this stroller to anyone!!!!No cup holder/parent tray2.First off, there is no cup holder or parent tray for simple physics reasons.Ouch!Also, be advised that not all universal cup holders work due to the girth of the handlebar.For instance, the "Munchkin Stroller Cup Holder" does not work.I bought a cup holder from Burlington Coat Factory, which I think is the "JL Childress Cup 'N Stuff Stroller Pocket" (based on appearance) and attached it to the front of the handle bar, but to be on the safe side, I'll try to remember to remove any beverage before turning the seat around.2.The seat does have some give to it, but that's good when going over bumps in the sidewalk.I think the seat is sturdy enough and I would have no concerns about the stability of the seat in terms of safety.3.It's easy to remove through.Getting the seat back in I find a bit more challenging, but after some practice I think I have it down.I love that the seat can be reversed.I also love that the seat and bassinet are the same unit.I love that the seat isn't still attached to the stroller when the car seat adapter is used - less bulky, less weight(in the Graco travel systems the car seat has to fit on top of the toddler seat).We bought this after trying to find a way to get our newborn cozy on the couch with us.This is a great flexible option.It is fleece and makes it very cozy for winter,I bought this so that I don't have to wash my boppy so often and it does protect the boppy well.I'd say this was a pretty wise purchase for the price.I am nursing my fourth baby girl, and with the other three I didn't have one of these.I honestly don't know how I got by with just couch pillows!This nursing pillow positions baby perfectly, and it's very comfortable!I especially love the chocolate colored slipcover, which I've already run through the wash and the color hasn't faded a bit!I have been using the pura bottles for the past couple months and I am really loving them.I originally was using glass bottles, but the stainless is so much better because there is no chance of breakage, and unlike the glass can be safely converted to a sippy cup when it is time (so I can justify the higher price).Their customer service is also excellent.I bought some avent ones, and they work great, but would have rather not had to buy them separately.2.The nipple it comes with is way too fast of a flow for a breastfed baby.The good news is that they are compatible with a lot more than they state on their boxes.I have the silicone sleeves to hide it, but I think they chipped more because I leave the sleeves on in the dishwasher.The non-painted ones still look amazing.The nipple has improved, they now are very similar to the think baby nipples, but they were still too fast of a flow until about 3/4 months ( I had to supplement the first week).I still had to use the mam nipple for my tiny newborn.3.I bought this for my 3rd child.Such a peace of mind at night!I always worry about him un-swaddling his blanket into his face or rolling over.Left button turns it on, two buttons pressed simultaneously turn it off -- how hard can this be?tested many times on myself (held my breath for >15s, alarm goes off without fail.)I absolutely love the Snuza Go.Our son is at a higher risk for SIDS due to being born a bit early and being relatively low birth weight.Because it is so easy to use, even his grandparents can use it.We decided to skip an infant seat and use this one rear-facing for the first year.Borrow one from a friend, request a dimension from the company, anything.It "fits" into my '08 Subaru Impreza behind the passenger seat, but the seat has to be all the way forward, so no one over 5'0" can ride in it.Are all the other instructions, even when they make sense, correct?I am not unhappy enough to return the seat, I think we will use it and enjoy it in forward facing position, but for now we had to get a separate infant seat which fits behind the driver and passenger comfortably and provides great infant neck support.Update: 2.5 years later, we've been enjoying the seat!It was tough while we kept it RF (for 2.0 years) because you do have to put the headrest on once your child is 22 lbs to continue to RF, at which point it becomes the size of any other seat with the same RF weight and height limits (like the Graco MyRide 65 which we also have).Once you FF, it's a beauty.Everything is easy to adjust, like the strap between the legs which is near impossible while RF.The straps glide easily through the buckles, the fabric comes off very easily.My favorite thing about it - the ease of install with a seatbelt for RF position.So I am upgrading my original 3 stars to 4 because it has proven to be a nice seat and I would recommend it to others.I took advantage of the free returns offered by Amazon and compared this 650 model with the 670 model and also with the model that is the same as Beethoven's 5th and a chocolate bar made by the brand starting with an E.I'm not going to be keeping this one, so here are the cons first:1) The fabric is a bit rough.Most every other seat that is for infants+ has a little something for their floppy head.Not this one.4) The recline is a bit of an overstatement.It's not like the recline feature on most other reclining seats.It's a tiny plastic flip lever that raises the edge of the seat maybe an inch up.5) It is purely a plastic frame.I would be super afraid to wash this pad.At least if it had elastic you could force it back into position if it happened to shrink.I read and reread it looking for it.Instead it's only color coded with numbers and x's.I'm not keeping it so I don't care.8) The head rest piece for the booster doesn't lock into place.It's just a tight hold.Pros!1) The removable hokey pad is really padded!Seems like that would be really nice, and also add an inch to the kids height, and maybe be uncomfortable for a wide rear.2) The cup holder can be put on either side of the seat!3) Fits really well in the Prius!Gosh but I was hoping that this seat would be 'the one.'I would prefer to use my own infant head stabilizer as the one that comes with the seat is super pillowy and pushes the baby's head forward.The crotch strap button that you push to move forward or back would be a pain to clean out.At least those are smartly designed.It's great for my 11 month old daughter.She can rest hear head easily and she is very comfortable in general.This seat fits well in our Honda Odyssey and my daughter seems very comfortable in it.In my opinion it is definitely worth the extra money to get the premier version.I hope to be able to rear face my large 10 month old for at least another year.I also have a radian XTSL for my other 10 month old which I like a lot, but the true fit premier has a better fit in my vehicle and was easier to install.This building Beaver is adorable!They are wonderful and My 3 month old loves his!I got this for my son when he was 3 months and now at 7 months this toy is still a favorite.There are great textures, sounds, and things to chew on.I sewed ribbon to the top part so I could tie it on the crib so the anmials are showing, not the black and white side.I bought this when my baby was about 2 months and she wasnt particularly interested in the black-white side (I thought she'd be fascinated by the pattern).I put it away and brought it out again when she was four months.She chatters away to the creatures and loves to grab for the rattles/squeeker etc.I didn't really do any research first and I should have.Then is started leaking and now you can tell the electronics are getting wet...the beeping is sounding funny.I did my research on bottle warmers and settled on the Baby Pro Smart Warmer.I love how it's customizable and you only have to press one button after you set it up.We have been using this warmer since our daughter was born, and she's 5 months old now.I like this warmer a lot, but it has some downsides.PROS -+ Customizable: I love that I can choose the size of the bottle, frozen or fridge, etc.I also love that it can heat baby food, which works great for the frozen food cubes we make+ Even Heating+ Low Maintenance: just make sure the reservoir has water in it, push a button or 2 (depending on whether anything has changed from the last warming) and then walk away - the beep tells you when its done!I originally tried the First Years warmer with the water measuring vial.So I bought this one because it's got a great concept of only refilling the vial once in a while.The multiple bowls are NOT so that you'll have extras lying around between washings.To blend, you must get the fourth bowl and the second lid.It just slings everything to the edges requiring that you constantly stop the blending process to scoop everything back to the middle of the bowl where the blades can reach it and, inevitably, sling it to the outside edge again.You must cut veggies into 1/2 chunks to have any hope of ever actually completing the steaming process which is about twice as long as they say it will take in the instructions.The water goes directly onto the heating plate.But it does work.The food processor half also makes more smooth baby food than my old food processor.And it is a small gadget so you can't make much baby food at a time.This seemed like a great choice.Unpacking the box, I got the impression that this was very light and not high quality.I had mistakenly plugged the AC adapter into the headphone jack.I next tested it by moving the parent monitor several rooms away, and it still worked.Totally unacceptable.I remember when baby monitors first came out...when some of my oldest younger siblings were little.You could 'receive' sound on a radio if you fidgeted with the tuner just right.This monitor really isn't all that bad for a sound monitor and is probably more secure than some of its predecessors.I don't use it as my primary monitor, but rather when we travel.I find it does a decent job of subduing background noise in favor of baby noise, but if the volume is turned way up you hear a fair bit of white noise.The only time my unit beeped was when I turned the power off to the baby's unit.That's totally acceptable, IMHO.I think in this day and age it really ought to come with a rechargeable battery pack OR be about $10 less expensive.If you are really concerned with keeping tabs on your young baby (under 6 mos) then maybe consider a video monitor.Otherwise this does as it should: let's you know when baby is awake when baby wants you to know s/ he is awake.When off direct power, I was shocked at such a small parental unit's battery consumption.In the end we opted to remove all batteries from the parental unit and remain connected to wall power when being used.I returned it and got another one at a slightly higher price-point.It's definetly worth a little extra money to have a monitor that allows you to actually hear what's going on in the nursery!And this is a rather bright light too.You have to turn the volume up high, and if the kids make noise you can hear.But a baby I do not believe that it will pick up the sound.But for older kids works  great.The First Years True Choice A100 Digital Monitor boasts how it "delivers the ultimate in security, clarity, and reliability at a reasonable price."I wouldn't go as far as calling it the "ultimate" in any of those areas.It gets the job done in our small apartment - it only has to transmit through three walls on the same floor.The blue light on the parent unit is annoyingly bright, so we had to put a piece of duct tape over it.This unit works fine.This is a simple plug and play unit.This thing is horrible at everything except keeping me awake at night because the parent unit has such an incredibly bright blue LED light!!Anyways, I like the appearance of it and I like that I can hang it on the wall with the wire angled straight down...but it's capability of picking up sound is horrible...or could it be the parents unit lack of ability??The child unit also has these bright blue lights, but my kids like that because it is kind of like a night-light...I on the other hand, don't think people will want to spend what this costs for a wall-hanging night-light.The Parent Unit...Ahhhh...the most important part.As I mentioned at the beginning, the blue LED has to go.The unit also has a clip so you can clip it on your shirt or whatever...but it never works because it was designed in an awkward way and the balance is off, so the clip is useless unless you can float when you walk, which I still haven't been able to accomplish.The power cord plugs in the side of it making it stick out a few inches...had they designed it to plug in the back, it would be much more compact, and the cord could have given it stability...but no, Mr. Moron wanted it in the side to look silly, contribute to the instability of it, and take up more room...nice going!With my Sony monitors, I can hear my daughter going to the bathroom next to her bedroom through the monitor, I can hear her rolling over in bed, her footsteps if she got out of bed...none of that with this thing, and that is completely unacceptable...which is why I trashed it.I typically donate things like this I no longer use, but why donate something that doesn't work??I really should have taken the previous reviews to heart before ordering this piece of rubbish.Rubbish?She told me that this product works wonderfully, almost TOO wonderfully because the baby wakes her up several times during the night.She said the volume is fine because she keeps the receiver right next to her pillow so she can track her baby's every cough and gurgle.So, to alleviate my guilt here are a couple - it is stylish and it picks up sound.Absolutely abysmal.Perhaps it is all the wireless signals flying around my home.I have wireless signal senders for the TV.And wireless telephones throughout the house.Maybe just a bit too much since at my parent's house I did get OK reception.For some reason, I thought that I would want a complex setup (web monitoring with a webcam, other features) for a baby monitoring system.I discovered that the P400 would satisfy the needs for a reliable, easy to use system at a good price.So far I have not experienced any interference with other electronic devices, the sound is CRYSTAL CLEAR and loud, and the two parent monitoring is great for our home office and bedroom.The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor with 2 Parent Units has several pluses but also some minuses.I was prepared to really like this one because of the 2 parent units and the 3-way communication.)-the kicker is a loud clicking sound, kind of like a short burst of static from the parent unit--this wasn't due to interference with the other unit, as it would happen off and on no matter where the unit was located--and it was too loud for me to have in the bedroom at night, so we can only use this monitor when we're awake, which is a deal-breaker for us on a monitor.The The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor with 2 Parent Units that I received were a light-grey/off-white color, not black like is currently shown as the stock image (however pictures on here can chage at any time).This helps so that you aren't left thinking you can hear your baby when actually you can't.The parent units can be recharged and so there's no need to constantly replace batteries.This monitor has many nice features that enhance its ease of use.She had a stroke and is pretty much confined to bed.The design is very simple and sleek, but houses an amazing array of features--volume control, battery and range indicators and lights.The night light feature is slick, and we love the walkie-talkie-style feature that allows the two auxiliary units to communicate with each other--"Did you hear the baby?"Highly recommended.With a unit like this her family and friends who are helping as caregivers will be able to hear her when she asks for help of any kind.The design is wonderful and it comes with rechargable batteries for the Parent units, with 3 AAA batteries being needed for the Nursery Unit.Low glow night light, easy to clean, 'sound lights' so you can hear if the baby/person is simply moving and making sounds or is in need of care.Has a volume control, and a high efficiency power adapter which is eco friendly and 'green'.The "True Choice P400 Monitor" is a good choice for those needing a system that supports two remote parent units.Here are my observations:Useful Features -* Two Parent Units have Walkie-Talkie functionality that allows remote units to talk directly to each-other, with or without including the base unit* Parent Units can be powered via AC Adapter or rechargeable batteries (included)* Parent Unit has earphone jack (but earphones not included)* Base Unit can be powered via AC Adapter or AAA batteries (not included)Pros -+ Good Range; we tested the parent units up to 80' away from the base, through several walls, with great quality+ Good Sound Quality; we have been very pleased with clarity of the sound, despite having a lot of other wireless devices (two Wi-Fi networks, wireless phone system, wireless headsets, etc) and appliances (microwave, laser printer, etc)+ Common AC Adapter; the set includes 3 identical AC Adapters that can can be used on any of the components (I LOVE this!)Cons -- Feedback when the Parent Unit(s) enter the same room as the Base Unit; not surprising in retrospect but the loud screeching will wake anyone sleeping\dozing if you accidentally wander in with it clipped to your belt- Parent Unit clip "stand" is fairly unstable; the unit falls over easily so we just don't use itThis system was a good choice for my needs and works well in my environment.Recommended!CFHThe First Years model I am reviewing here is for our twin girls, who will be arriving soon.We were very pleased to find that extraneous noises from this monitor are virtually nonexistent, which is amazing, given our past experience with baby monitors in our home.In addition to having no extraneous noises, the signal quality is remarkable.We could also speak with our son in the nursery (that is a different button than the one used to communicate between roving monitors), but that just seems too weird.We are concerned that our son would grow up thinking there are mysterious voices coming from his walls or ceiling.Therefore, we have not tried that feature.The clarity is great as well.This baby monitor system is packed with features.We love the "Walkie-Talkie" like feature that lets you talk from parent device to parent device.You can even talk to the base station through the monitoring device, and it works great!The signal strength was really good and there was no interference from other items.Having a set of newborn twins, the 3 way monitor option is ideal for contacting the other parent.But at least 3-5 times a day, it would loose the signal for some strange reason even though neither units even moved an inch.We are happy with the lack of interference, particularly because certain parts of our house have a metal roof, and we've had trouble with interference in other wireless devices.The parental units are small and portable.Having two separate parental units is a real benefit (many monitors only have one unit).The sound quality is not always great or clear, but it works for us most of the time.I've been using monitors of one form or another for over 6yrs now.Starting with the most basic/cheapest when my now 6yr old was born to an AngelCare for my 3 month old now and pretty much everything in between.For now I'm using the Angelcare Baby Movement and Sound Monitor Delux Plus, Blue which I also really love since at this age (3 months) she doesn't need to be able to have me talk to her, she cries and I go in her room and for me the ability to know she's breathing is priceless however once she's bigger I knew I'd want something similar to her big sisters montior which would allow me to respond to her if she called me.I'm also grown quite fond of having 2 parent units (I have enough to lug up and down the stairs so having one on each floor is great).I should also note that I had no issues with interference from either of the other monitors we use (had all of them turned on, plugged in while testing this one) so for those with a multiple montior household I would expect the same.We always have great clarity with the main monitor but occasionally when we speak between the parent monitors it can be a little difficult if we are at a great distance.I can't explain enough how wonderful those parent monitors are!Also touching the child monitor near the transmitter light, turns on a blue colored nightlight so you can see in room without turning on a light.I think this is a monitor that will really grow with my child.3-way communication between all units is simply fantastic.I'm already rolling my eyes because a lot of companies are hopping on that bandwagon these days even if it isn't entirely true.It really couldn't be more simple.So no loss there.Even more wonderful are the clips that are on the back of each unit so you can easily clip them on your belt loop or pocket and you're not tied down anywhere!This definitely changes all of that and as a mom who gets the bulk of her work done when the kids are napping, I can't state enough how much I love this feature.The really beauty in this set, however, is in the 3-way communication.That in itself is priceless.The other nice thing is the other parental unit.If I'm working in my office in the evening and my husband has the other unit, we both hear her and we can communicate quickly and easily about who is going to go get her.I can push the button, ask my husband to go check on her, and within seconds I'm back to work.As a writer, this is priceless.Can't recommend this highly enough!originally, after 2 weeks of use i gave this 4 stars.i have no reduced it to 1. i wish it could be 0.initial impression:small, compact hand units.thought it was nice range.than, they started dying after 3 months.never mis used it..replaced with another set, per amazons 365 days of returns for baby stuff.2nd set came in.so i repaired handsets to main set.problems started right away.2nd set wont turn up past half way, and the lights on that handset were flickering and blinking.(and yes i know how to use these.. we had the first set for 3 months).2nd hand set works ok.. but the main parent unit had weird issues.id turn it on and it will randomly, turn it self off.The blue light is very bright.The parent and child unit seem to lose connection quite frequently, resulting in either no sound received from the child's room or a loud beep until you turn the unit off and on again to reset.A frequent clicking sound also grates.After nine months, the other parent unit went kaput.Also, when you turn the child unit off, the parent units beep if they are on.The feature is intended to help you find the parent unit, but it has the unintended effect of encouraging you to leave the child unit on at all times and waste electricity.With second child, I can appreciate NOT hearing every breath as long as I hear stirring and sounds occasionally, which the monitor definitely picks up.The two parent units is very nice because I'm not always backtracking to find the unit before bed--I can leave one downstairs and one upstairs.These monitors have been useful with very few issues, so overall no complaints!We have a 2-story house with plaster walls.Sleek but functional.Would definitely recommend these because of the two parent units, ability to talk between parent units, overall simplicity of use, and (so far) good performance.The signal is mostly clear, though we do get some interference sometimes.The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent Unit is a rather powerful unit with great features.Many people have already pointed out several of the great features such as how it doubles as a two way radio, the range is great and the unit also can be used as an intercom.Other than that I'm not able to say much more than to repeat what others have already pointed out in their reviews.In my experience, this is a great model.It appears sturdy and dropping the parent unit (twice) has not affected its use.The sound quality is excellent.It is very easy to use and my 6 year old likes to use it as a walkie-talkie.I don't know how this would work in newer condo's and/or apartments with thick concrete floors, etc....but we placed these as far as possible, and even behind our stone foundation (there is a part of the basement that we can access) and we had no interference.I am very happy with it!We even have 2 stories between parent's monitors and it works very well.Compared to other older ones that have real noise, it is hardly worth mentioning.We are very happy with it and have no reservations with recommending it.First, the size - the main control unit is incredibly small and won't take up much space.It's entirely possible there was some interference with the quality of the baby monitor's wireless signal.While The Choice P400 is described as a digital product, the signal may not be strong enough to overcome architectural design in older homes.I highly suggest either borrowing this item from someone who already owns it to test it out, or make sure the retailer you buy from has a reasonable return policy.)- minimal to no static even in a home with LOTS of electronics- good sensitivity to small noises (adjustable sensitivity)Cons:- variable and occasionally terrible range - sometimes it loses contact with the base unit when it is less than 30 feet away (even with thin walls or windows and no other electronics in between).- sometimes it thinks shows it is linked, but doesn't have contact (doesn't beep or flash) - you have to power the parent unit off and on again.- base unit lights are VERY bright (but are all blue and do have a friendly "smile like" appearance)- very easy to confuse the headphone jack with the power input hole (in which case no sound will come out, but all the lights may be on)As a point of reference, the other monitors I'm comparing this to (in order of preference, including theThe First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent Unit) are:Safety 1st High-Def Digital MonitorPhilips Avent Digital Screen Baby Monitor with DECT TechnologyPhilips Digital Monitor (previous generation, 3.5 years old)Fisher-Price Long Distance 900MHz MonitorGraco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby MonitorThe First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent UnitSafety 1st Sound View MonitorSafety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, WhiteThere are some really great aspects of this monitor, I just wish the technology held up to the promises.Unlike analog baby monitors that operate on a frequency similar to a radio, the First Years True Choice P400 uses Digital technology to scramble the signal as it travels between monitor and receiver.The digital technology pretty much eliminates your neighbors accidentally hearing you or annoying static, making the sound fantastic on this model.The True Choice P400 comes with one nursery monitor and two parent handset units so that each parent can have one at all times.The parent handsets are compact and fit perfectly in your hand; it is about the size of a small cell phone.Best of all, the parent units run on an included rechargeable battery system so rather than paying for a hundred batteries, you can just plug it in with an AC adapter to recharge it.The parent units also feature a headphone jack (great for when Dad is mowing the lawn!)and a volume control.The nursery unit is also compact and like most it plugs in with an AC adapter, but can also run on regular batteries.The nursery unit also features a parent-unit finder so if you have misplaced a parent unit that is still turned on, a wall mount option, and a proximity sensor nightlight.A unique feature of the P400 that we absolutely love is the 3-way communication.This feature allows you to speak into the monitor to soothe your baby on the nursery unit or talk to your spouse on the other parent unit.One button on the parent unit transmits your voice to both the nursery unit and the other parent unit at the same time.Another button on the parent unit transmits your voice only to the other parent unit so it doesn't disturb the baby.This option allows you to use the parent units like walkie-talkies.There are multiple channels on the P400 like you would find on other monitors to "find the clearest signal".We didn't really see a need for other channels because we always got a perfect signal no matter where we were in the house - no static, no interference.I would highly recommend this unit, it's a breakthrough in nursery technology and it's a must have for Moms!Our 30-year-old wall intercoms don't work anymore and I didn't want to go from one end of the house to the other to constantly check if she needed something.These units saved my life.The reception that far away wasn't great, but I could catch enough that I knew she needed something and, occasionally, could understand what she needed.At this distance, I couldn't use the talk-back option, but it didn't really matter since I had to go anyway.That is, once we got used to how to use the buttons, which aren't too intuitively placed.I can never predict or understand why, but I suspect block walls and changing directions have something to do with it.It isn't exactly Bose sound, but then again, it isn't a Bose price tag either.Static is not an issue and, when there was no sound being generated by the "baby" unit, there wasn't any static or electrical sound in the "parent" unit either.I don't know what would happen in a two-story house or in an apartment building where you are competing with other frequencies.However, for me, under my current circumstances, it is a life saver.You avoid a false security.I love the small, lightweight design.The baby monitor has a soft blue light.Comes with rechargeable batteries.I am very pleased with the range and design of this monitor.As many other reviewers have mentioned, this set has many excellent features and performance.Not much has been said about the battery system, though, so I wanted to point that out, in case it will be a concern to you.The two parent units:- use a proprietary battery pack (looks like aaa batteries wrapped up and attached to a proprietary connector).- are rechargeable (yeah!)- use the same power adapter to recharge as the child unit (you could take just 1 if traveling)The child unit:- takes aaa batteries, with no way to recharge them inside the unit- requires a screw driver to remove the battery case (really?!Both around town to friends and family's houses ... and also for weekends, etc.off of batteries3) only have to take 1 charger with me when I travelThey certainly perform their function, they're sturdy, you can see what's inside them, and they are cute.A few graham crackers, raisins, puzzle pieces, a few crayons, or hair elastics will do absolutely fine in these.Although I did not purchase these from Amazon (got them a while ago before Amazon started selling them, but LOVE Amazon!I'm a Prime member and have weekly Amazon deliveries.)I have had them for a few months and absolutely love them.They are great for organizing my daughter's smaller toys.I threw away all the big puzzle boxes and put the pieces inside these pouches (freed up so much more storage space).While I think the pouches are great for many many things I do not recommend using them for sharp objects.I love my baby jogger summit xc.* The ability to lock it into place while jogging is great too.* It is easy to control one handed* The tether strap and hand break add safety* The stroller folds very small for a jogger (smaller than my travel system stroller)* The wide wheel base makes for a steady, stable ride* Shocks allow you to run and baby to be comfortable, it also allows the stroller to go off the pavement (we took ours on an uneven walking path through the woods and it handled the roots and rocks well)* Very easy to fold* Pretty big basket under the stroller (compared to other joggers) as well as a mesh storage space behind the seat.* No parent tray or child tray (both can be bought separately, I bought a jolly jumper parent tray that works perfectly around the hand break).I loved this monitor for the first 6 months of my son's life.For us, the picture is great and never any static.I bought a couple of these to take along on spring break.I ended up purchasing a replacement from AmznI think this would work great for a 9 mo old and up that is pretty steady and can sit upright easily.While it has a 45 lb limit, it may be a tight fit for a chubbier child, would definitely pick the chicco if your kid is over the 85 - 90% in weight for height because my chubbier twin barely fits into the straps at full extension.If you purchase theSummer Infant Tiny Diner, Blueand Kiddopotamus Bibbity Rinse & Roll Bib in Blue  they match perfectly with the seat and store inside the seat easily and you have a travel kit ready to go!Also the Chicco is washable while this is strictly wipe clean so definitely not for every day use as a booster.If you purchase theSummer Infant Tiny Diner, Blueand Kiddopotamus Bibbity Rinse & Roll Bib in Blue  they match perfectly with the seat and store inside the seat easily and you have a travel kit ready to go!It is very sturdy, and the design makes it work on pretty much any chair.It has ample storage space.It is extremely easy to use: the first time I opened it and adjusted it, it only took 5 minutes.My son is 8 months old, and it works fine.If I had to pick something I didn't like, it would be that the straps that hold the child are a little too close together, but it is not a major concern.Great travel seat.It is too just too small for my 13 month old.Overall it seemed to be well thought--i just wished it was more appropriate for +1 year old child.There is also one pocket in the storage compartment that I might put a thin book or travel sized coloring book/crayons in.You could fit larger items in the pocket, but keep in mind that takes away from the general storage capability of the rest of it.The outside of the bag is black and a lime green (which I LOVE).The inside is the same as pictured here.She is a calm toddler, but I still believe an active child would do well in this seat.Then again, it's a travel booster seat so the short amount of time he/she might be ok.The Jeep version of this has pockets on the outside sides for additional storage and this Munchkin version does not.But I didn't want something too bulky so this is perfect for me.I can use it with my back to either side, depending on my mood/ desires for support.- It's big, but not too big for a couple in a queen bed.My husband even likes to snuggle up to the back of it.Cons:- The cover is too tight in one place -- at the inside edge of the top curly-q.What this means is that there is a taut, hard seam on that inner edge, and it could easily dig into your neck or shoulder depending on how you sleep on the pillow.I tried to massage the pillow around to distribute the filling differently, but it didn't help.My son is really into throwing everything he is done with onto the floor.Not just dropping, but throwing with vigor!Our friends and family think it is hilarious.It connects to just about anything and in my opinion is really easy to get on/off.My only complaint is that the tether is not adjustable in length.I got this bc my daughter would pull things off the links and throw them, so I figured it was time to get something she couldn't open on her own.So, it does do its' job.This was an impulse buy, while I was waiting in line at BRU and my son was throwing his sippy cup.I'm not sure how well they would hold onto bottles and sippy cups.I love this.Have been using it for almost two years and the velcro still does strongI truly think these are the best modern cloth diapers out there.They are leak proof (love, love, love those gussets), they have a fantastic insert, the insert falls out in the wash on it's own.I have a full stash of these I love them so much and they work great for daycare.They are awesome, BUT I think the sizing is off for these.Also, I loved the range of colors the original wraps came in and wish they would offer the duo in those colors.I have heard complaints about the laundry tabs not sticking.I'm fine buying 2 sets of diapers if they will really fit the spectrum of sizes that a baby will be from birth to potty.Colors are adorable.They are also soft on my baby's skin and keep him dry.For these reasons, I give the diaper 3 stars; I just wish I would be able to use them longer.The size 1 says it fits from 6-18 lbs, so after testing the absorbancy, I purchased 24 of them.This was a high up-front cost (almost 500 bucks}, but I planned to use them until he was around 9 months old or close to 18lbs.They were great at first, but he is now 12lbs and, although we have them on the largest setting, they are too small for him.This is the first pocket diaper I purchased, and I love it!The insert really does come out in the wash, and cleans well even when snapped together.This diaper will come in handy for babysitters, grandmothers, etc.I will post another review in a couple months as far as durability, as I have only been using this diaper for about a week or two.Updated review 6/11/10:I have now been using this diaper for a few months.The BG 4.0s (I have 1 so far) are more generous as far as sizing, but they only come with a microfiber insert for the same price.3) The price is great for what you get.The Knickernappies with the loopydo inserts cost $6.50 more per diaper.We used the size 1 with velcro and got the size 2 with snaps, and used them with Indian prefolds and Snappis.The fit was good and easily adjusted.Velcro - it's just easier and wears more comfortably on the baby, however, the velcro does catch on the other diapers in the wash and causes the appearance of the fabric to degrade.My recommendation would be for the velcro.One is that the cover stains easily, both the white trim and the cover itself - particularly with newborn poops.They aren't super bulky either which is nice, often times I find with pocket diapers that they are HUGE and it is hard to get pants on over them.I also LOVE that these are made in the USA.Our little one will be growing out of size one probably within the month (seven months old).They have held up wonderfully and are virtually leak proof.Reinforced my love for cloth diapering and Thirsties.The colors are also super cute.In the summer time your little one looks "dressed" just with a prefold and thirsty on.We'll be ordering size two soon!definitely gets the job done.Mt daughter loves to throw her bottles after she is done drinking.she is 12 months and still thinks it is funny.These are such life savers when out and about!Plus you can adjust the size (length) for your stroller/highchair/purse/grocery cart/etc.Highly recommend this!I bought the Pilko P3 7 years ago and used it with two kids and then my friend used it after that.Which means I open and close it 12-20 times a week and it held up great!We decided on one of the Graco Travel systems and were very unhappy.The fabric did not tear and didn't look faded in the least.But I also always store it in doors.It is light, and very easy to push and smooth smooth smooth!I am still amazed that it's everything - very plush, comfortable, light and compact.It was very comfortable for my 40 lbs.three year old and also very comfortable for my 20 lbs.one year old.It fit nicely in my small car, and my large SUV.It has some things that could stand improvement and maybe they have with this model?but if that's what I have to loose for this compact stroller I will.Instead I just tucked it into the huge sun canopy, as when it's not being used it formed nice large folds to store things in.Also when I first bought it, the sun canopy kept unclipping on one side and I had to keep popping it back into place.My kids are snackers - so I don't buy a stroller unless it's got this feature.5) Easy folding and light.I LOVE Peg Perego's harness system that is 5point but also unhooks from the back of the seat so that they can sit forward.They are still hooked in to the 5 point system and still connected to the stroller, but they have much move movability without any danger or chance of escape.I LOVE this and so do my WIGGGGGGLY toddlers.If the price tag is too much the Combi SoHo is awesome too!I also love, love, love, love LOVE the Bob Stroller.I had one and almost prefer it over this.It's beautiful and it looks sturdy and good quality, but haven't been able to use it yet because baby hasn't arrived.Once baby is here, I'll review ease to use, functionality.In the meantime I just can say it looks fantastic and works perfect with the Primo Viaggio car seat (which also is Paloma).It's not huge if you take into consideration that is a complete travel system; however, if you have a small trunk you better choose something else.I have and Accura RDX and have just little space in my trunk when the stroller is there.I received the shapes play mat for my son at Christmas and I loved it so much I bought the rest of the set!My son right now is 7mos and he loves feeling the textures and playing on this mat.I don't mind at all getting on the floor with my son now each b/c it's much more comfortable.I can't wait until he gets bigger and starts taking out the letters for fun!It is of great quality too so I know it will last.This is a great find!I have been a fan of inflatible bath tubs for babies since I was given a Tubby 32 years ago.When my grandson was born, I encouraged my daughter to purchase an inflatible tub; she chose the Secure Transitions Baby Tub and is quite pleased with her choice.These add an extra measure of security to prevent the tub from slipping around.Great transition from the Baby tub, which was too small for my 1 year old and definitely safer that the regular tub which is too slippery.Good solution for this stage!!Traveling or at home, it works great.The screw tops make such a huge difference.Worth the price!First, an unexpected benefit of this item is it's the perfect size for my 9-month old to sip water from!I make baby food at home with whatever vegetable and protein and spices (and garlic or ginger!)Very nice.So far, these are a good size for a meal for our boy (still mostly nursed though), but maybe you should get two sets to start if you're making your own baby food.I had to order a second set.I keep our baby food frozen for up to a week and have dropped a frozen container once but it didn't break...after reading other reviews though I really try not to drop them!It's lovely!I used freezer jam jars for jams and thought it would work great for my little one.What I would recommend especially as baby eats more and more is Ball Freezer Jam containers.All of their plastic jars and containers are BPA-free plastic and are dishwasher safe on the top-rack.Jars are stackable and lock together for a tidy freezerTwist on lids seal in the freshness and prevent leakingFreezer safe - straight jar sides allow for food expansion during freezingBall Plastic 8-Ounce Freezer Jars, 5 PackAlso, instead of any specialized baby food mills, just get an immersion blender (aka burr stick).and makes great purees!I am making my baby's food at home and needed something like this.But other than that, these containers are sturdy material and exactly what a mommy making baby food needs.Other than being WAY too small (it takes two or three of these per meal), they're pretty good.They are a pain to fill too b/c they're so tiny, so I lay down a flour sack b/c it gets messy.I've switched to the small rubbermaid containers w/ the reddish lid.They are Must-Have for homemade baby food.Too small to grab and perfect to manage in one hand.A purchase you will not regret!I have only had these for two weeks and made two batches of food.I dropped one while frozen and it broke the lid, but any container would have broken i think.They are very sturdy and the cap screws on tight.These are good storage containers; easy to stack, easy to wash, easy to use.The only complaint is that the tops sometimes don't stay on.I  love these containers.They have a good seal and they keep the baby purees I make very fresh.However, these containers are so small (they fit 2 oz) that I can only fit up to one cube of frozen baby food (approx.And, my daughter usually eats more than 2oz during her meals.I realize Stay-Fresh markets these containers as an option for storing "fresh" baby food and also for freezing newly made batches.To me, that is simply not practical.And, most people I know who make their own baby food produce large batches so it can be frozen and you can avoid making it on a daily basis.While the containers and lids are nice quality, I don't think I'll get much use from them overall, which is disappointing.So, carefully consider your intended use before making the purchase.Pop tops will make nothing but messes when they pop open unexpectedly.The screw tops keep my puree securely in the jar, so they never burst open in my bag like the pop tops.I highly recommend these to any parents who are making their own baby food.Works Great!Either way, it works.I came across Sure Lid Lock Seal Containers.They are perfect for freezing homemade baby food.I bought this bookshelf and it has many great features such as the book covers face out for easy selection and it was relatively easy to put together.Also it was the perfect size for the small area in which I put it.The little storage bins are great for storing extra books and toys.Also, it says "natural" color but it was an off orange color.Soon baby will be sitting up and will be able to manipulate these fun colorful blocks that have pictures of their loved ones all over.Nice for families who are often spread so very far away these days and for those close by.The tiles look great, fit together perfectly, and are firm but bouncy.Although we have not been gentle with them (and we now regularly walk on them with our shoes), they have stood the test of time and still look great.These are a great purchase and we've been totally happy with them.These foam tiles are great.I didn't want something in blaring primary colors or with alphabet, numbers, etc, but wanted something that would seamlessly blend with the rest of our home.Now i can breath a little easier when my little one is crawling and cruising about.It's not thickest flannel sheet I've owned, but it's a good quality at this price point.I love that my little guy has a soft, warm sheet for winter nights.They're also the perfect size and require very little scrunching to fit well.At home I usually just dunk and swirl, but these are great for when we go out or I leave my little one with his grandparents or aunt.These have been great.They will give you the closest cut, and are the safest to use!I can across this brand (Simba) and took a chance.Love these links... very well made, colorful, well priced and they have so many uses.MUST HAVE for any new parent.Especially since my oldest son was so independent and hated sitting the stroller.However, I knew at age two, he still would tire sometimes when we were out.Before having my daughter, I would just carry him.But now, I would have two to care for...and there was no way an infant could walk while I carried a two year old.I found the BuggyBoard online and knew it was for me.My husband called it a surfboard and my son was sold.He loved the thing.By age three, my son welcomed the seat of a stroller and we retired the BuggyBoard when he turned four.Then we welcomed my third child and I was so happy to have the BuggyBoard in use again.It was a great for trips to the shops and restaurants with my daughter.I was joyous!Trips to parks with three were so much easier than I expected.The BuggyBoard is so great in my mind.It gives kids independence, rest, and it is fun to ride.I had no idea it would be so awesome.The weirdest part about using the BuggyBoard, was that I was basically a celebrity.It is that cool.And so does my son!All of them have been fantastic.(check with dr about swaddling at night- we can do it because he's only upright at night)  We simply could not wash the one we got originally fast enough, so we bought a few more... and a few more... lol!He LOVES them too.It's great!Although my son outgrew swaddling in general pretty quickly, I just loved this one.The Summer Infant swaddles--both fleece and cotton--were the best design I tried, and I love the patterns available.This one, in particular, is a great color and a little more hip that the average swaddle!If you live in a warm climate, I highly recommend these in cotton, as well as the muslin wraps such as those available through Aden and Anais.They don't have the security/convenience of the velcro swaddles such as this one, but I liked using them alongside these for daytime, or as a light blanket, etc.This stroller/carseat combo is cute and well made.I got what I paid for, but in the end, I wish I had purchased a stroller and a carseat instead of a combo.Her cousin has a graco carseat that looks the same, but was purchased alone and the carseat that is not intended to go with a stroller sits at a more reclined angle, and she will be calm when in that one, but screams in ours.Also, the flip feature isn't worth it.That seems normal, and "flips" them.Another review from someone who hasn't actually used this with a baby yet...but I have already purchased it, based on my researching strollers for almost a year via online reviews and in-store experimenting.There are a lot of great strollers out there that cost big bucks, but I wasn't willing to pay $500+ for a stroller.I love this one because it's lightweight and has a slightly-narrower wheel base than most of the other stroller systems I tried out (this stroller weighs 19 lbs, compared to the 28-33 lb ones I was trying out), and is VERY easily maneuvered with one hand.The color scheme is gender-neutral.It's very pretty, and the aqua is just slightly brighter than pictured -- not garish at all, and aqua enough to not automatically scream "baby-boy pastel blue!I found one other that did, but you have to move the seat itself, which takes time, effort, and can't be done with the child in the stroller.I set it outside for a couple days to off-gas, and I'm going to wash the fabric parts before using...but the smell dissipated very quickly.UPDATE -- My daughter is 15 months now.I still think this stroller was a great buy, and the ability to have my child facing me is GREAT.So when I want to preserve trunk space, we go with the $20 umbrella stroller.We were deciding between this system and the Metrolite travel system.We purchased an Alano Flip-It in a gray/yellow combination that is great looking and gender-neutral.The stroller folds down to a compact size, so that it fits nicely in the trunk of our compact car (we can't fit the larger Graco models, like the Quattro Tour).It does have a small zippered pocket on the back of the stroller that can fit keys and cell phone, but not much else.Overall, we are happy with the size and performance of the stroller, although there are a few features that I feel are sub-par or missing.I love the color.I mainly bought this stroller/car seat combo because you can flip the handle to make baby face you.The cup holder also adjust for the flip.There isn't really anything about the stroller/car seat that I hated.This travel system is really great, is not too bulky like another Graco Travel systems.The fabric is soft, beautiful and unisex in my opinion.This stroller seems to be really safe, great quality and price!!We've been using the system for the past 10 weeks, since our baby was born.I absolutely love this travel system.The patterns can be used for a boy or a girl too.This travel system is very easy to use and a great deal!I researched strollers a lot before I bought one and you can't get anything better for the price than this!The color is definately not what it looks like in the picture though.It is more green than blue, but it is a nice color and gender nuetral.Have the next size on hand as babies are notorious for growing a size overnight.The price seems steep for a simple sack, but unless you can figure out how to make one yourself, they are worth twice/triple the price.Consider use cost....since you will use it 20 hours of EVERY day until baby outgrows that size.I thought $25 was too much to pay for a swaddle sack/blanket, but the Woombie is worth every penny.It is my new favorite baby shower gift.My baby won't sleep at all unless me or my husband is holding her and/or she is in the Woombie.I was desperate to find another option to swaddle my 5month old son.I bought the Miracle Blanket and he got out of that (I think he was too big for it and the fabric wasn't stretchy enough.)I have read the Woombie website and it gives tips on how to transition your baby into using this successfully so I am trying that for naps, which is put him in the Woombie and put the tight swaddle over that.I think that if you use the Woombie from birth, it would be flawless.But going from a tight swaddle to this is pretty tricky.He likes to wrestle with his bottle sometimes now that he is learning to use his hands better and the Woombie is perfect for that.It's a great product and the fabric is awesome.Reviews I had read kept talking about the velcro closure at the top and how it cuts their baby's chins and I was happy to see that the one I received didn't have velcro over the zipper at the top.Although it didn't exactly solve my problems, I am happy with it and am using it daily.I think the neck will be too small before the body is tight enough to immobilize his arms.Now that my baby is 12 weeks, I'm adding to this review.This worked great for us after our son started working his way out of a wrapping swaddle.The color is bright.Highly reccommend.I received the Woombie last night & exhausted, I put the Woombie on my son and as if it were some kind of magic, he immediately calmed down and turned back to his adorable pink color.He LOVES the Woombie & mama does too!!However, if you have the patience and will swaddling with a blanket is even better because baby cannot move arms around as they can with the Woombie.I first tried the woombie after my sister raved about it, and it is worth every penny.I loved the first Woombie I bought so much that I bought a a second 'Lil Houdini model plus a winter version for the upcoming winter.Sad to see it go but I'd highly recommend it to anyone whose baby ISN'T yet rolling over.I have purchased other swaddling blankets from Aden + Anais and quickly fell in love with their versatility and size to swaddle my growing little one.I agree with other reviews that you just can't stop touching them.The prints are also beautiful and vibrant.I bought Aden and Anais classic swaddlers before and are great.I couldn't stop touching them!It's great.We own two for our daughter - they have lasted well through washings and keep her warm.I would love to see them make a 6 layer bag for extra cosy warmth.This sleep sack is wonderful and honestly, I do not understand how it does not seem to hold up well as other reviewers complained.I wash it on warm and tumble dry it on low and it comes out oh-so-soft.These are awesome!Zipper is a pain when trying to change diapers in the dark, but i'll get used to it!I am a bit biased because I love everything aden + anais and when they started making things other than the swaddle blankets, I couldn't resist.This Four Layer sack is great for most of the year in Seattle.It's definitely nice to see our son cozy in it during the warmer weather but not feel like he's overheating.I am concerned about how these snags will unravel after several washes.Given the cost and the delicate nature of the fabric, I won't be buying another one.We continued to use it until he grew out of it without any other rips.I really love Aden & Anais swaddle blankets, so I purchased this security blanket too.With the swaddle blankets, I was able to fold it so it became 2, 3, or 4 layered.Maybe I just wasn't expecting it to be only 1 layered.Got this the same day we bought our Joovy Kooper.This one works really well and comes with 2 snack bowls and lids.This will grip the side of an umbrella stroller, jogging stroller, or whatever you have.I just found this item and, wow, I love it.I wish I had found it sooner.It's great for my daughters sippy cup and toys/snacks.It's just nice for her to have a place to put her stuff so it's not in her lap.Comes off easy to fold up your stroller.Love itI felt pretty cool!It comes on gradually and does not wake up a sleeping baby.The music is pleasant, however.Not a big deal though.And I love the light!The remote doesn't operate great...sometimes you have to press the buttons a couple times, but it will eventually work.But part of that is good quality construction.Positives I like.Very manuverable wheels, comfortable seat, secure and easy to use straps, ergnomic handle, fairly lightweight, and easy to collapse once you get the hang of the procedure.You also get a nice mesh storage area underneath the stroller.Just a couple of negatives.In the end though I was very pleased with the purchase.And the wheels are really nice, it is highly manuverable and smooth.So everyone has a great ride.I bought this stroller to travel with as we have a running stoller with a staionary front wheel.Great canopy(comparably), easy to fold and light (maybe not THAT compact but I have a small car and there is plenty of room for other items in my trunk), sooo easy to push (wheels like a dream), love the tray and parent cup holder, but most of all I love that it reclines.Also, I am 5'7" and this is comfortable for me to push.My husband is 6'3".I bought this stroller bc I own the original Kolcraft Contours, which is a great stroller.It was okay for the sale price I bought it for but I would much rather have my Joovy Kooper over this anyday.I'd say spend the extra and get something nicer.This is the nicest light weight stroller I have owned.Kudos to Kolcraft for putting one on a lightweight stroller.The basket is HUGE and it holds quite a bit.During a move across the world the cup holder broke off but it wasn't much anyway so we got the Sunshine tray, that was enough and a perfect upgrade.When I bought the item, I thought what a good deal I got, until it arrived.The shields do not hold a shape.The blanket is  much thicker then the traditional muslin wrap, but not as thick as the dream blanket, so it is cozy for the cooler fall months.It's super soft and washes wonderfully, no shrinking or fading, very good quality.I don't use it for swaddling as much as just wrapping her up in it in the morning when its chilly.Highly recommend this blanket.absolutely wonderful blankie...going to need more!!Would be fabulous shower gift!This crib rocker really doesn't shake the crib or rock the mattress, it more rattles against the crib rails.We have a pack n' play that has a rocker and it sits under the mattress and really does a nice job of rocking the baby.We have a pretty nice quality crib - a Graco Sarah - that doesn't shake too much.It might work for you, but don't expect anything nice to come in this box...I returned and purchased the Dream On Me Extra Firm mattress, so we'll see how that works.my only complaint is I can't take it when we fly because it would take up too much room in the suitcase.Finding this cute crib mattress, especially for Mini cribs is a pleasure finding them on Amazon.very nice, wish I would have had it two years ago when I used my pack in play more.I know there is an "extra firm" mattress, which might be a little better since this one is pretty soft, but this one does the job.also, a regular pack & play sheet (or a regular pack & play padded sheet) fits perfectly over it.I purchased 2 of these - one for my Graco Pack and Play and 1 for a Cosco Playard my Mother has at her house.It is a little too small for your standard Graco Pack-n-Play but, I rolled up a baby quilt and stuffed it in the gap (length wise).The one I sent to my Mother could not have been a better fit.There was no extra space to spare - as a "crib" mattress should fit.I also tried the "extra firm" mattress but it was really firm.I am very pleased with this bassinet.It is easy to assemble taking less than 10 minutes.The baskets on the bottom are a nice touch.It comes with everything you need to set up a for a boy or girl.It has a pad in the bassinet.Also, the wheels do not lock, which is dangerous.I bought it for My sister baby and she is loving it.it does not hold a lot of space and low enough to see thebaby from the bed.Great buyI bought a bunch of BumGenius 4.0 which I LOVE.I am using them on 2 1/2 yo twin girls.But I tried some of the Flips inserts, too.The Flips covers is just a bit higher quality than the econobum cover IMO.The organic inserts hold the most pee, followed by the econombum.It doesn't covered a pinned premium prefold as nicely as I'd like, but it DOES cover it (and my husband says it's because I pin funny  :-P  )  I think it would work even better with a smaller baby in an infant sized prefold.I am happy to have 2 of these, with a variety of inserts - not sure I will buy any more.I am updating this to say I now LOVE these as covers, but not crazy about the flips system.I have found I don't really like the bumgenius on my young (7 months and small for his age) baby - too bulky and completed to fold them small.A prefold and nylon pull-on pants has always had top billing for me for absorbant + super trim.They will also fit through a range of sizes.I have got a few more flips, and 2 econobums which are ALMOST as nice but not quite, and I love both covers with prefolds.Since we had to change to the regular size inserts in her bumgenius 3.0 diapers, these Flips are now trimmer than those, and so we have grown to prefer them.It's a great system to start CD.My 4 months old was learning how to roll, and she couldn't do it with this on.I bought one thinking, geez, its under $10, why not give it a shot and love it!If you follow the wash instructions this diaper would last you a long time and for those wanting to CD to save money, you could get away with using these for $100 for 2 years and save a ton!I love these!If it is raining, the baby will get rain from head to toe.On the other hand, everything else about the seat is wonderful.I have a little girl, but this would work for either a boy or girl.I thought I'd have to buy the base separately.Also, I love that the strap adjuster is very accessible, you don't have to flip the seat over to loosen/tighten the straps.You can loosen/tighten the straps while your baby is in the seat just by pulling or loosening the adjusting strap down by baby's feet.My only complaint is the visor...it's sort of hard to pull up or down.these leggings are a nice soft cashmere-type material but they frayed the second they went into the wash.Just wash by hand.Most travel stroller fold inward so as to protect the seat, etc.The City Mini does not.2) Since the City Mini does fold inward, the belly bar I have on it for my son would be exposed to god knows what...he chews on that thing all the time and I want it covered when we travel.3) This is a pricey stroller and I don't want it damaged when we travel.Easy to drink fromEasy to carry alongEasy to take apart and washandYOU HAVE A TOP neither you nor child can lose !!AHHHH!We are learning to set it down gently.Still leaks if tipped over though.I moved the stars from 1 to 3.My daughter has been using this cup since 9 months old and she's almost 2 and we're still loving it.The internal parts are not too hard to put together and I have not had leaking issues with this particular cup.These are kind of pricey so I would protect your investment with a sippy tether.We ride the subway frequently and without that tether we would have lost this sippy!So it's still not an independent cup...I've washed it in the dishwasher many times now and it has not improved...this is the first sippy cup I've ever had experience with so perhaps all are like this?The cup is also very heavy when full (b/c it's stainless steel and insulated, and very sturdy)--perhaps more appropriate for an older baby.Overall, this stroller is very solid and maneuvers like a charm.It can comfortably fit two babies, or two toddlers.The material is awesome!However, if you are a mom of a single child now and 'plan' to extend your family, you might want to consider something LIGHTER for the mean time.Perhaps, the City Mini.I don't like that it can stand after it folds either.And it's cheaper without having to buy that extra seat.First of all, the color Diamond should not be sold to any parent.It shows dirt too easily.I did not realize this when we purchased the stroller, that the parts cannot be machine-washed.Who wants to hand wash, anyway?This is a great stroller for what it is, though, as a possible double stroller.It folds close nicely, which was important to us, since we noticed with cheaper strollers this became an issue after a while.Very sturdy stroller.Baby Jogger would not exchange my seat for a different color when asked.You still have this stroller that looks terrible because of the color.I wrote Baby Jogger and told them that they should not sell this color, they did not address this issue.We did not, and on the way back from a flight, our stroller was dropped.I'm a first time mom who's done tons of research on everything I bought for my little one.I had a tough time finding a stroller that met all criteria on my "wants" list- high quality construction, excellent manueverability, rear facing seat capability, bassinet option, and not too heavy.I was also hoping the stroller could have the capability of accommodating a second seat (for the future).I considered the Bugaboo Cameleon Stroller Dark Grey Base, Red Canvas Fabric NEW!and theUPPAbaby Eco-friendly Vista Stroller, Yellow/Maya, but wasn't completely happy with those two.However, it was definitely worth the wait and also the cost!It meets all my criteria (as stated above) and exceeds my expectations of a good stroller.The Ruby color is very nice, the fabric & the frame all feel top quality, and it is super easy to fold & unfold.An unexpected plus is that I have made very good use of the extra roomy basket and the adjustable handle (I'm 5'5" but I prefer the handle at the extended length).I love this stroller.It's not quite as nimble as the Phil and Teds, but definitely safer (fewer pinched fingers and tipping incidents), tons more storage space and much more adaptable to life with 2 kids (soon to be three).The weight of a child in the second seat makes the stroller a little bit more difficult to maneuver, but that is true of ANY double stroller.This give you by far the most configuration options for two kids (particularly if it is important to you to have both kids actually be able to see things around them.These work well and are very easy to learn for grandparents, husbands, etc.It helps to stretch out the snappi a little before using the first time and remember to wipe it off with a wipe or wash it in cool water and dish soap every now and again.Also there is a larger size for toddlers.Well, after my son arrived I was happy to show her just how easy and wonderful these worked.She is now just as big of a fan of the Snappi as I am.Maybe it's the diaper I use them with (Baby Kicks), but the Snappies do not grip very well.They are satisfactory,that's all.I got these because they were a good size for small hands to hold.I will wait to see when she is further along in the teething process.Overall, very pleased with these!When my son started to work on ALL FOUR of his first molars at once, it was brutal.And when he DID find objects he could place far enough back to reach his sore spots (drumsticks were a favorite), they simply werent safe to be jammed in the back of his mouth and usually ended down his throat until he gagged.My son is gnawing one right now as I type this, happy as a clam for the relief it brings.We love this cup and my son loves it but the straw gets clogged with gunk over use and I do not see a way to dismantle the straw tube so you can clean inside it.I bought two of these straw cups for my 7 month old daughter and they are great!The end of the straw that baby drinks from is almost solid, but with a few slits cut in it.**Update:  Some leaking issues and a solution:My daughter is now almost 14 months and these cups are still my first choice.Second, I figured out that the top "mis-threads" really easily.i must say, theyre great.they create a tight fit for the prefold/flat diaper, which is really nice.i think these are for more of a piece-of-mind thing [no slipping and poking you LO with a sharp pin] than an improvement in the diapering world.i give it five stars because functionally, its works great.its not everything its hyped up to be, just an alternative to keep the diaper together, but it does work.These are working great for us.I have never used pins to contrast them, but they are definitely allowing me to use folds that I couldn't do without them.The color is more vibrant than shown, which was great for our nursery.My daughter loves this gym.It is about 11" wide x 3-4" deep (depending how full you pack it) x 7" tall.I think I'd like it more if it was just a bit smaller all around.This clutch can easily fit 2-3 diapers plus a small pack of 80-100 wipes (or that hard plastic wipe container) plus your other random items.That said, the random items will be floating around, as there are no internal pockets--just one middle divider.This, along with the fact it has no internal pockets takes it down to four stars for me.I am still deciding if it's going to work for me, but overall, even if the size isn't right, it's a great product that I would recommend.It arrived in a large box.The chair has held up great to the kids climbing on it, extensive use, etc.The chair itself is very comfortable with extended use, EXCEPT the padded seat.The cushion isn't the greatest.The glider looks great in the online picture-but the fabric is a lot lighter in person.It still looks very nice in the nursery, but it's also very small.It's pretty comfortable and I believe it will do the job once the baby arrives.For now I do sit and read in it and am pleased for the most part, but I do wish it was a little larger so I could put my head back.My daughter LOVES her wubbanubs!We have a couple so we can switch them out.They are really great!Definitely worth the price for this one!I purchased the Orbit infant stroller system a year and a half ago.You would think that the seat should be anchored so that the entire back of the seat won't lift up when a child sits up but that is not the case.I really regret buying the Orbit system.Thank you Orbit for leaving PVC in the dust!I actually saw my baby smile and sigh today when I strapped her into this bouncer.:-) The highest setting is still just a gentle bounce for my 10.5lb 9 week old baby, but that plus the soothing music is enough to lull her to sleep happily.It seems like your baby needs to weigh less than 8lbs to actually move the seat.How much can that small ball really move the seat?!?!It looks great and seems comfortable but the bouncing is not very strong and it eats thru batteries.Pros:- Soft and comfortable for a newborn- Machine washable cover (toy bar is spot clean)- Toy bar moves back easily to remove baby from bouncer- Toy bar is sturdy- Very nice ocean sound that my baby lovesCons:- Not much difference between the 2 bounce settings.Not a strong enough bounce for my baby to enjoy- Toys on toy bar are lacking- Eats thru batteries- The songs end and start abruptly instead of a smooth transitionOverall, I'm not to impressed.I would not purchase this item again.I don't think that this automatic bouncer has quite enough "bounce" for her;  It is quite gentle.Other than that, it is aesthetically pleasing, plush, and can be used for either a girl or boy.It is a great size, small and folds up easily for storage or travel.So there, mother!It is so much fun to see her content and happy.I really like the bag i think the best part is it opens wide and stays open.The chaos of the moment, and the small selection in our rural area, is evident in the choice: it was the one somewhat masculine bag for a price he liked, and it's big.I wound up using it for 4 weeks because I didn't have a chance to organize another system for myself, other than "throw it all in a big huge bag."Yes, IT ALL does fit: diapers (and we do cloth), extra outfits, the Moby Wrap, some blankets, little doodads in the outside pockets and the inside clear plastic pouch, two quart size water bottles, and my laptop.But "it all fits" was good enough just until I could get out to a city with shopping choices and get my own bag.The fabric is mesh so you can kind of see through it.I have some trouble stepping over it, but my husband who is 6'1" can step over it without any trouble.And unless your cat is absolutely massive, they'll fit through the cat-door.Our cat weighs 20lbs and fits through with only a little bit of ducking (she's not just fat, she's also tall).]This gate is great for smaller cats, probably about 10 lbs or less.I have one cat that is approximately 18 lbs and he can't fit through the opening.The gate leaves black marks on the walls.Our walls are a tan/creme color and we have black rings and smudges from the rubber stoppers on the side of the gate.2.If your baby is anything like ours, once our son became more mobile, the cat hole became a game for him.Mind you, he does the same over the gate but in case you have any concern about this, it's good to know.3.Finally, the gate can shift along the wall if enough force is used.Our son is 28 lbs and is able to shake the gate and move it along the wall.He hasn't succesfully moved it enough to have it push down, but it does shift.I also wish that you didn't have to leg over this gate.Our son is now 32.5 lbs.If you have a kid that's strong, I would probably opt for a gate that attaches to the wall and let the cats jump over rather than putting the kid at risk...I have a small baby and the belt fits her just fine it's that the tray is a bit to high for her but she will grow into it before she outgrows it.They are the SAME in every respect, except for color.I was trying to find a highchair for when we travel to grandmas, or on vacation and had been researching the evenflo collapsable highchair.I ran onto this highchair by accident.We love it.It has a full size tray, and keeps my nine month old so content.A few cheerios on the tray, and he is happy.We have not been easy on this chair, and it has held up great for travel.It is very easy to put together and install.So far my lil girl loves sitting up higher and eating with the family.We had a handmedown, but it took way too much space up.After reading the one review about the pad for the seat, I can see where it might be torn off with a lot of force, I MEAN ALOT, but if you have your child buckled in, your child shouldn't be able to turn around pulling it apart.Great space saving idea and price is a plus when buying these baby items, so this one deserves a HUGE thumbs up!Found this at Target on sale and thought what the heck I should try it.I love that it holds all four of our large Avent bottles, all six of my Medela storage bottles, all of the nipples, and it doesn't take up much space on the counter at all.Just wash and push down where ever you want.It is that easy!It really is great!I like the functional aspect as well as easy of use.For instace since it is green the clear color items such as silicon nipples are easy to find.And the hieight of the rack gives more space for air.But It is designed for small size items and definitely not for many baby bottles.It's super stylish and fun, and functions just as advertised.I HIGHLY recommend.We have been using a spinning bottle rack and a dish towel or two to dry bottles & parts for the past 5 months.I was tired of the dishtowels which inevitably would catch crumbs from around the kitchen.We just got a Boon Grass countertop rack last week and it's awesome!It's great for the Dr. Brown's bottles and also great for odd-shaped or small items like spoons, baby gum brush, boon spoon, etc.I find that I am able to stand everything up without it falling over.It fits nicely in a drawer at my office and I do not need to worry about my pump pieces falling over when I shut the drawer.I'm not sure how many bottles this would be able to hold if I were using it for bottles, which is why I only give it 4 stars.Overall, I am very happy with it and of course, I love the look!Of course we didn't realize this until a friend inquired as to why it was taking us so long to wash our bottles every night.I was very skeptical - but the increased air flow undderneath of the items must make the difference.It's worth the expense to me!I dry my pumping parts and bottles.It's easy to move around when its completely full.I depended a lot on amazon reviews when researching items for my first baby so it is only fitting I share my two cents.This drying rack is not large but it is very efficient use of space.I am mostly breastfeeding so I don't have a ton of bottles, but it works great for two sets of pump parts that I rotate and 1-2 bottles per day.The "grass" sticks up allowing you to place parts all along the sides.If you have items stuck too close to each other, the grass in-between kind of "bends" and it doesn't secure either item.My 2 month old daughter eats 7 times a day, and I can fit all 7 bottles on the rack at once, with room to spare.I would not typically use this many bottles in a day, but I upgraded from short to tall, because my daughter now eats more.Today I needed to wash all 13 bottles at once.Washes well in the dishwasher.I had it out of the box and set up within 5 minutes.I bought this play crib as a back up.My son hates his crib, and he wakes up every time I lay him in it.This crib cost less, and it seems just as sturdy.All in all, it's a great purchase.my son(12 months) loves this floor puzzle.boys tend to be a little rough sometimes...!I had the regular MAM pacifiers when my little one was baby, but purchased these with the soft edges when he started teething.The colors and patterns are darling which is good, because they go wherever we go.I was skeptical, but this pillow is a must if you're breastfeeding multiples simultaneously.I purchased this twin nursing pillow after the less expensive Double Blessings pillow no longer worked.I've been using it for my twins from 3 months old until now - 8 months old.Pros:  Soft, washable cover.Lip at edge helps keep babies secure, but they can still easily roll off if you're not paying attention.Buy an extra cover because accidents happen.UPDATE:  This pillow is still working and my twins are 18 months old.The foam is starting to break down a little bit, but it's still functional.The zipper on one cover broke, but luckily I have a spare cover.It has held up through almost daily use.I've had straw cups that have to be carefully threaded and pushed.This just pops in.A little pricey for a drinking cup but well worth every penny.It has been dropped many times in the past and it is almost two years old so I feel like it held up well.A friend of mine offered to let me borrow her Baby Bjorn, I'm not sure what model of Bjorn it was but it was huge!Breath ability, the baby can face forward, comfortable, secure.It is really great.Someone mentioned that the baby nearly fell through and it is dangerous, I have really no idea how that could happen unless they didn't secure any of the straps.So I can say I've had a lot of experience.I really loved our Bjorn, but as the summer heat came around and baby started to weigh alot more it just wasn't comfortable anymore.My baby loves the front facing out position and I had a hard time finding anything that was comfortable for that.The Pikkolo felt like she was just facing the ground and pulling on my back.Plus it had a lot of fabric once you move to the full motion option.So that was hot.This carrier though was just awesome.Its really soft and comfortable.We took a long walk on the beach and my back felt fantastic.The breathable fabric was so great.It kept both of us cool.If you've used a baby carrier before, you'll probably catch on really quick as at least one of the positions will be familiar.But once you have it down, its easy.We love it.I would highly recommend this for the summer or if you live in a hot climate like us (Florida).The mesh is great!The pros are that it is lightweight, has a variety of ways to carry the baby (although we have only used the front carry with baby facing forward or backward#, it has two little pockets on the front for keys, gloves, etc., and it has nice padded straps.So when I saw the Lille Baby carrier, especially the light weight sports model, I decided to give it a try.However, after carrying my 7 month old facing out for only 5 minutes in it, my back started to hurt a lot.It could just be the sports model, but I decided not to try the original and just stick with my Bjorn.This is the only place I could find these and I am happy.Space saving because it is a swing and vibrating chair in one, it does both really well, and the seat is nice and deep so it can accommodate a newborn and an older baby.It is easy to move around and easy to use.There are several speed settings for the swing.My only complaint would be that it appears to take two separate sets of batteries.we purchased this swing after watching Harvey Karp's "Happiest Baby on the Block" DVD (which is awesome).The upside is that it is compact and light weight.I even love the music!I still haven't used the vibration part because I haven't gotten a battery for it.The battery life lasts pretty long, the swing speed is perfect (and my baby is not small) and its easy to assemble.Yes, I can buy a body/neck support item, but it takes away from the cute ocean theme seat pad.My baby is big and has strong neck control, but I wish I didn't have to worry about it.2- The music turns off too soon.My daughter loves it.The swing has 5 speeds, but I pretty much only see 3 - slow, medium, and fast - which is definately enough for us.The music is wonderful and while I can't speak for the Precious Planet, the Ocean Wonders uses traditional classical baby music with the sound of bubbles popping every once in awhile.It's great.The vibrations are a huge bonus as well and I like how easy to move it is depending on which room of the house I'm in.This swing has beautiful colors.It also doesn't light up or or move, but it's pretty.The seat is very deep and she doesn't slump over much as she can't sit up on her own yet.The music is also slightly upbeat and has two volumes.The vibration is nice as well.It's very easy to put together.I have to use two hands and bend down and look to get it latched.Not a danger, just startling.I wish it had a larger range.She likes it and is very calm and happy when she's in the swing, so I would be happy to buy it again.I decided to try these and they have been wonderful.I absolutely love it.For the great price it is worth a try.He always got his hands underneath and would move the swaddle part...so if you need a good swaddle...this isnt the greatest, but it is a good lightweight sleep sack.Honestly I do not know what I would do without these.My son is 6 months old and constantly rubs his face while he sleeps.The blankets are really soft and warm.Also they unzip from both ends for easy diaper changes.This slumbersack is really soft and warm for my baby.My son is 6 months old, so he may grow into it.This is exactly what I needed for a north TX fall evening for my lil man!It's very soft, washes well and keeps him warm w/out over heating him like some thicker sleepsacks.I wish I would've bought 2!These fleece sleepsacks are so soft and cozy.We had to turn up the sleeve cuffs so our 4 month old could still play with his hands, but he loves it.It doesn't stay tightened, and since my son is just moving past the "supported sitter" stage, that was a little concerning to us.He did seem comfortable and the toy loops are great.The weird part was the strap underneath.. we figured it was to go behind the chair back, but again it wouldn't stay tightened so we ended up tying it off.All in all, I got what I paid for and as long as I keep my eye on him, I'd say it's fine.I am really happy with this purchase.It takes FOREVER to attach to anything.If youre alone, good luck holding a baby and weaving a belt clip thru cart and tying it down in bows in like 4 places one-handed.I use these with my Chicco Cortina Key Fit Travel System.They work great.Be careful because you don't want the stroller tipping over!My SON loves these pacifiers.I chose the pacifiers that are blue and white with racecars on them.However, I opened the box, and to my dismay, received HOT PINK pacifiers with peacocks on them.My husband will not be pleased when he sees our SON with HOT PINK, GIRLY pacifiers.After trying every brand out there, we are a committed MAM family.I love them because she loves them, but even more, she uses the outside when teething.Everytime my twins woke up in the morning, their heads would leave a mark on the mattress (yes, it was that soft).So I was looking for a better mattress for this mini crib.so if you have a Delta mini crib, know that you can purchase this mattress for it.When I took the mattress out of the box it felt to me a little too firm and I was afraid it wouldn't be comfortable, but my twins LOVED it.When I press on it, it does give in a little so the firmness of it is just right for babies.I also purchased the "American Baby Company Waterproof Fitted Quilted Porta-Crib Mattress Pad", so the surface feels softer.Both my husband and I laid on it and found that the carpeted floor was actually more comfortable.When I first opened the package, I thought it was too hard and that my son would never be able to sleep on it.He has slept very well and it fits perfectly in our portable crib.This is a nice, firm, well-covered mattress.Unfortunately, it is just a little too small (width-wise) for theGraco Modern Pack 'n Play Playard with Bassinet & Changer, Zurich.My husband, who will usually try anything, just isn't comfortable with the gap for our little baby on the way.Yes, we could stuff it with something, but as first-time parents we're just not comfortable with that for a tiny baby, but we may keep the mattress for later, since it was so affordably priced.(if you were thinking of adding it to the bassinet part, it's actually a little too short length-wise for that part.This is one very very firm mattress!For those looking for sheets to fit this mattress -- theCarters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet, Sagejust barely fits on it very tightly, with a bit of effort, before washing.I love it.It's also fun to watch the water come out of the mouth.This is a great addition to baby's nursery...got one as a gift for my first child and bought this Carter's calender for the second since that one was so successful.It's difficult to keep up with baby book entries with a newborn, but if you keep this calendar hanging by the changing table with a pen, you can just jot things down for possible baby book entries later so you don't forget them!I love the muted, unisex colors of this calendar...it's babyish and cute but not sickeningly sweet.How refreshing!I feel more comfortable for her to lay on the mat than on the carpet, since there can be a lot of dirt and allergens trapped in the carpet.The color is really vibrate and great for babies.Most importantly it washes up really well.We've owned it for 4 months now, and she still uses it and still looks great!Just got one of these for my 16-month old ... am trying to wean him off pacifiers at bedtime/naptime and thought a blankie would help to make the transition a little easier.However, it's still a good size and I am very happy with it otherwise.It's softer than another organic blankie that I'd bought a while back (not this brand) so I was relieved about that.I love the details like the satin paw "pads" and claws - nice touch.Thank you for making a great product that is also organic!I purchased this on an impulse, after finding them on Amazon.I am pleased with the purchase.We had a little bit of a hard time fastening the interior divider to the tiny buttons (which I almost didn't even realize were there) but it's very sturdy and high quality materials.I expect this to be of great use for us since I am so into organizing things.It has several pockets on the outside and a 3 way divider on the inside.It's very nice, and I think the cat in the hat design is very cute.This is a fabulous stroller.After doing days and days of research on umbrella strollers, I ultimately decided to go with a lighter true umbrella style stroller vs. the "lightweight plus" umbrella strollers ranging in the 16+ pound range that usually have more bells and whistles than super lightweight strollers, such as larger baskets, better shade, etc.I am so pleased that I went this route because the lightweight of this 11 pound stroller is a super breeze to pop open, close shut, get in and out of the car, lug over my shoulder, all while holding my baby.The basket is actually quite roomy compared to other popular brands of strollers.All of that fit nicely with room to spare.Plus, the canopy on this stroller is amazing!Not only does it come down far enough in its usual position, but you can rotate it around toward the front for even more coverage.MUCH better than any umbrella stroller I saw during my research!Overall, we are very pleased with our decision in purchasing this stroller vs. Maclaren, Britax, Chicco, Zooper, Keekaroo, and Ingelsina brand umbrella strollers.Some things to consider:1) With 2 children in diapers now, I can hold about 2 days worth of diapers, though that obviously varies with the age of the child, the type of diapers used, and the day (in general).2) While the bag does an excellent job of keeping moisture and smells inside, it is in the end just a bag.It will be fine for a couple of days, but it does start to leech out a bit of moisture and smell.I purchased the size Medium and will def be buying another one in the next size up.The print is fantastic and the quality is great.feels like sturdy material.I have not had a chance to use it yet, but I will soon.I would also like to mention what excellent quality it seems to be.I give it 4 stars because I wouldn't say it completely contained the diaper stink like others claimed it would.They are also terrific for travel items such as shampoo and conditioner.I didn't purchase this one here, but only because Amazon didn't carry them when I bought mine.It's the perfect size for the diaper bag.I own the black & white swirl design and it looks exactly like the picture.This is great to send to my babysitters house for a days worth of cloth diapers.It is the perfect size and washes easy.I love this stroller.Sound system works great and the colors are really sharp.The sunshade unzips so that you can pull it all the way down to the tray which is nice for evening jogs as the sun goes down.It has a sizable basket for a jogger and two cup holders-which is nice when my husband and I go out together.It doesn't fold up easily and is quite large when it is folded up, so take that into consideration before purchasing.I cannot say enough wonderful things about this stroller!My husband and I wanted an umbrella stroller because we like to travel as light as possible.To accomplish that and actually have what you need, however, you have to plan and research.We found that McClaren might possibly be the only brand that makes an umbrella stroller for use with kids under 6 months of age.My husband is 6'2" and I am 5'5" - and we both love to push it!It's a very simple solution that meant we could buy this one stroller and use it for a long, long time.It's also true that this stroller doesn't have space for holding much in the bin underneath, and it's not balanced to hold much on the handles.But if you want an amazing, small, and lightweight stroller - this is it!These pads are nice when you have a slimmer fitting shirt on and you don't want the bulge of your nursing pads showing through.The only down side is that in the dark (nighttime nursing) it is hard to tell which side is the side that goes against the skin without taking a few seconds to examine it.So once the pads are saturated, you may get petal shaped rings of dampness oozing out from the pad edges.But htese are great for those who don't leak a ton, or for brief wearing periods.Also note that since they don't have adhesive, they may flip out of your nursing bra when you drop the cups to nurse.Since my car seat was not compatible in the BOB stroller I bought this so I could put my baby in it for walks around the block.He is snug and warm in it.If you lived in a warm climate or it is summer it might be too hot.But, it is fall and I live in the PNW so it is perfect.I love it!If you own a Graco Snugride you figure out fast that unless your baby is older, "snug" isn't part of the ride.Now that he is getting to where he doesn't slump it offers the bonus of keeping him warm - which he loves.He loves it so much he prefers to nap in his car seat over anywhere else....If you live in a warm environment this isn't a good choice but if like us you live where it is often chilly, consider it.Ours came with the car seat strap covers which helped the straps fit better (the Snugride ones can be floppy).Once he hit 6 months we took them off as he didn't need them anymore.The cotton is really soft on these which works perfectly for sensitive baby skin.they are warm and breathable.The size is pretty generous at 47x47.It's just 4 pieces of cloth.That's it.-I also am not a huge fan of the design.But then again - no newborn is going to care, and neither did my sister, who these are for (her baby, specifically).-They do work well as swaddle blankets - they're pretty thin stuff - and have a little give to them so they work well for swaddling.I just can't get over the price - for some material you're going to wrap your kid in and have him puke all over then throw out once you're done swaddling - ugh.All in all, I wish I found this sooner.The metal clasp is great and the ribbon is high quality.We've had three of these now and even with regular use over several months, we are very pleased with them.I have been looking for cups like these for several months now.They stack neatly, very colorful, sturdy and most importantly, my toddler loves them!My kitchen pantry is a mess with toddler cups, plates and bowls that don't stack neatly and tumble out on a daily basis.They are cute, colorful, and give her the feel of still being a baby without being a baby cup.I will allow her and her older sister the Munchkin straw cups as well.I love this colorful set of cups and think they are a great way to make growing up more fun.), and dishwasher safe.I had been searching for cups for my toddler to transition from a sippy to a cup, but everything I found was too large.These are a great size, they are fairly small and just the right size for his little hands to get used to holding and drinking without too many spills.When my 2 yr old daughter was learning to drink from a "big-girl cup" these were perfect!Until I found these I had trouble finding a cup that was short enough, stable enough, and a small enough top opening for her little mouth.These cups are:-cute (imprinted pattern, bright colors),-translucent (mommy needs to be able to see where the fluid is while supervising),-unbreakable (plastic doesn't crack like the acrylic cups we own),-dishwasher safe (top shelf, bonus: BPA free),-stable  (wide base),-easy to hold (just the right height, width, and slope from top-bottom), and-easy to drink with (opening is a good size--not too narrow or wide).My 19 month daughter learned to drink from a cup with these too.And now I also use them for snacks too--makes for a fun alternative to serve grapes or popcorn in.The Munchkin Multi Cups are a great cup for kids who are transitioning out of lidded cups to open topped cups.They're not too heavy and they hold 1 cup of liquid with about a centimeter to spare at the top.The colors that you see in the image are what you get - you're not going to get all boys or all girls colors.Both my toddlers can hold the cups comfortably in one hand (my kids are 1 1/2 and 3, respectively) and there are small raised images on the cups to make gripping them a little easier.The cups are easy to clean, and not too expensive, so if you happen to lose one, it's no big deal.Highly recommended!We bought these for our 14 mo old son.These cups are the perfect size for his hands and the colors and designs are attractive.He did very well with his first attempts at drinking from a cup.Other reviews have complained about the small size, but for us they are perfect.I don't think a bigger cup would work for such a young child.These are great cups!All the kids that come over loooove the cups.And they are easy to wash in the dishwasher.The light lavender scent is pleasantly noticeable without being overpowering.I was really hoping to love these little deodorizers, but I the best I can do is like them.The diaper pail was the only place I intended to use these but when you open the package, all five of the fresheners are automatically open.I love them for the afore mentioned applications though and will continue to buy them for those purposes.I'm not a fan of lavender scents, but this one is not overpowering, and is actually quite pleasant.Our son loved this little book but got bored with it fairly quickly.The toy is of good construction but our son never really got into it.Mostly user preference I think.I bought this for my 3 month old because his older sister was having an Elmo themed 2nd birthday party, and didn't want him to feel left out:)  Anyway, he loves to chew on it, even though he's not even close to teething yet.I'm very happy with the crib.We visit my sister often and used a Pack and Play when my son was smaller.Once he outgrew the bassinett portion, we hated the Pack and Play.It was so hard to lay him down without hurting your back or having him wake up as you lowered him down.This crib is great since we don't have to bend all the way down to the floor to lay him down.My husband loves the changing table feature which I have not seen on any other portable crib.We have taken the crib on a few road trips.Its not as easy to travel with as a pack and play but my son sleeps well in it and its easier on our backs.They are easy to use but I don't think they're too terribly comfortable for baby.Also, the sizes are very off.They are great .That is just a perfect environment for a rash.all this was just $4.80 on sale here so i figured i'd give it a try, worst case i can try to sell them or repurpose the items.it def wont work for overnight, but its great to give you the extra boost during the day!i leave dd in this combo for about 2.5-3 hrs with no leaks!i suggest trying it out yourself and see what works for your l.o.of course it is no hemp or terry or microfiber, but for the price and shape, its perfect!all other doublers are much wider (these are abouot 2 inches wide) and leave the crotch area bulky in my opinion.Try at your own risk.We originally purchased aPhilips AVENT iQ Bottle Warmerprobably mostly cause it looked cool and had pretty buttons.However when our little guy was born, we immediately realized it was a trash design, and I ran out and bought this one.The Dr. Brown warmer is an amazing peice of engineering.It uses Steam to warm the bottle.The buttons are easy to press and work very much like a microwave, so no confusion and zero learning curve.#4.The blue light screen can be seen from pretty far away and in the dark.#5.The warmer shows a visual count down in terms of time.The warmer's top isn't latched or safety locked.The warmer is surprisingly stable even for it's height.The removable basket can be flipped over to reduce the warmers depth so that shorter bottles ( like 4 oz) can be easily removed/ reached.If you need a solid warmer which is easy to use with no hassle, this is probably your best bet.Update 3 1/2 years later:The product still works fine.3 months later there wasn't any mold or mildew.Just go ahead and spend a few extra dollars on this warmer.if you have twins, etc.It truly is perfect.Obviously this can be frustrating when you have a hungry baby on your hands.You can use a coupon at BRU and it is a great price for what you're getting.This is an excellent bottle warmer.We tried the First Years BabyPro first, but this one is perfect for twins because it can heat up more than one bottle consecutively, whereas the babypro takes 10 minutes to cool down and reset before you can heat up another bottle.Also, the water reservoir and the memory timer are perfect, making it easy to heat a bottle to the perfect temp each time.I am still using this mainly for the timer feature.For some reason it would not stay on long enough to warm the bottle.This is the only warmer that I've tried that actually makes the bottle the perfect temp.This is the best warmer out there well worth the $.I love this bottle warmer!Just don't forget to reset the timer when the power goes out - I did!It does a great job of safely warming bottles.However, we have found that if the reservoir is kept full, it doesn't leak.I purchased this item because I was having a hard time warming 8 oz wide neck Dr Brown's bottles.I stock up a days worth of prepared bottles in the fridge every night and warming the bottles up can be challenging on the First Year's brand warmer (I had the old one and the new released one and these worked great for my 4 oz bottles).Because the Dr Brown's warmer stands taller, my tall (8 oz) bottles warm up better.With the First Year's brand, taller bottles did not warm as well because they don't sit as deep.I also really liked the water container feature which allowed to warm up to 5-6 bottles before refilling with water again.Two drawbacks:- It seems like it takes longer for the bottles to warm up.Not sure if this is because I am dealing with a hungry baby and watching the timer count down makes it worse :)- My water container seems to leak once in a while.This bottle warmer is fantastic easy to use, pratical, compact, system and funcionality well though out, I can't say enough about it, I'm so happy I got it, Dr. Brown's products has always met and exceeded my expectations they worth every penny!- not to mention using up our extra towels!The only thing we were gripping were our hearts when we found her down the street!Great stroller for the price.A little short tho.I bought this stroller for when my 9-mo old granddaughter and I are out and about.So....if you are tall you might want to consider another stroller but, all in all, this is an awesome stroller for the price.I use this mostly for in the house (I've had multiple back surgeries and use the stroller instead of carrying the baby inside) so it isn't that big a deal.In hindsight, had I known this I may have considered going up a bit in price/quality.I got this stroller as a gift and loved it at first.I wouldn't have bought this stroller for myself, but I would much prefer investing in a stroller that has an umbrella.This is just a cheap umbrella stroller, but it is cuter than most and seems to roll smoothly.This bath tub will leak.When it is full of water, the weight of the water will bend the plastic body (especially when I lift the tub to and from the bathroom floor to faucet).Our 1.5 year old son loves it and will run over to sit on it.It's quick to open and fold.The shoulder strap makes it effortless to carry even while attending to a toddler.It got a lot of use this summer and our family has been very happy with it.The printed material is silky smooth, almost satin-like.The underside of the blanket is a tougher polyester canvas.The blanket isn't super padded, so it is more appropriate for grassy lawns or beach sand than granite.Backpack style is best if you are under 5'9 (straps are a wee bit short for backpack style if you are tall), but messenger style works even with my 6'2 husband.It is highly water resistant.Also, when folded, you can use it as a seat pad at sporting events.But for perishables, I'd recommend a separate cooler.Much better than "the First Years" nipple wipes which ended up irritating me.My only complaint is that the scent of these is pretty strong, kind of sickly sweet vanilla.I would prefer unscented/more natural.This cup is cute and doesn't leak, but it just doesn't stack up to the natural flow cup.I have no idea how they made this cup work, but it does not have the typical valve system and you don't have to fuss with it at all to get it to do it's job perfectly.The one thing I will mention is that when you are assembling the two internal parts together, the little "bubble" part must be pushed all the way through the disk for it to work (not a big deal, I just didn't pop it through the whole way the first time and it won't work at all if it isn't popped through).Some people have commented on the fact that there are a few more parts than other cups, but to me it's not a big deal and I would much rather have one or two extra parts to clean and get a quality cup that actually works!We've bought two of these, one from a store and one from online.You might also get one like the pictured cup--clear cup-like part, pink lid and yellow/orange handles.Our daughter loves these.No complaints.This is perfect for a newborn baby!This is the softest thing ever!I chose grey and it's one of the best baby stuff I bought!It cradled him just perfectly until he was big enough to stop falling over to one side.Wow, this is a really big bag so if you have a small frame keep that in mind.The bag is awesome, the amount of room it has and the organization in it is wonderful.I can't describe it but the top part gets raised up when it's full and the zipper never gets in the way.Genius design.It comes with a small purse which I love.I use it very gently but sad to say it's probably not going to last as long as I thought.Would give it 3.5 stars.this is a VERY nice and affordable option for someone who wants a mei tai.the straps on your shoulders are padded and fairly wide...would also be great for dads.the straps are long enough to fit around me [5'7" 158lbs] with extra.i wouldnt use it in the foreward facing position, it throws your balance off and adds preasure to your babys pelvis which is unnatural and can cause spinal developement issues.but for front and back carry its great!theyre a lil too wide for me, but its comfortable and doesnt bother me, really.theyre very padded and dont dig in at all.but the side of the "square" part are padded nicely and, even with the wide-ness and bunching, her legs never have red marks and her circulation is never cut-off.this also keeps lil "i wanna grab everything" hands in check.its very nice.very easy to put on and adjust3.wish it could be used for newborns but doesn't seem to have that much versatility as other wrap carriers.Hands down I think I prefer the moby wrap and it's cheaper.I am a single mother of two wonderful girls (2yrs and 3wks old) This wrap is a life saver!It's so easy to put on and take off.She thinks she is getting a piggy back ride while I'm doing chores and I was happy to discover that I can JOG (not run!)Makes for a great work out.I had purchased http://www.amazon.com/Dandelion-Reusables-Utensils-8-Pack/dp/B0029XVBPO/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1283377444&sr=8-1-fkmr0 for my twin, 14 month old grandchildren.They are similar in color, but they are not the same size.If you are looking for spoons with deep bowls, these will not work for you.these are great "learning to feed myself" spoons and forks.They are probably exactly the same as the one in their tea set although I can't say this for sure as I have never seen the tea set in person.However - since day one, he's hated it.He's really uncomfortable in it, and I can see why:-The strap that you can either wrap around the baby's back or legs seems to keep him in a rather uncomfortable position if it's on his back, and if I try wrapping at the legs, it digs into them.-He also doesn't like to be held right up against me, he likes to be able to see what's going on around him, and this carrier doesn't really allow for that.-This carrier is also made of very thick fabric, which doesn't really allow for air flow, so even in decent weather, I'd pull him out and he'd be sweating.-I also find that I have to readjust and keep retying the carrier every half hour or so.When I had my second baby I needed another camera and on a whim decided to "upgrade" to this set instead (I got the set that comes with dual cameras).Also, in both day and night modes there is a lag...like with a cheap web cam...movement looks like it's in slow motion.The Summer Infant handheld day and night monitor was highly rated, but people complained that others who owned the same monitor could actually see your baby which freaked me out a little.So we bought this newer "secure" version even though we couldn't find any reviews on it.Sound and picture quality are good enough if not great and sound quality is amazing (my husband and I could hear each other whispering clearly when the volume was only on level 2).The design is awesome (the monitor is the size of a cell phone which fits perfectly on our nightstand).He is comforted by it.I really like it too.We've had it for a couple of months now and are still as pleased with it since the day we got it.I got this for my 2 year old.She absolutely loves it!She carries it around and takes it to bed with her.The rechargeable base is great and all the different light colors is so fun for my daughter.I bought one for each of my daughters.My oldest is 32 months old, she loves her owl!It is great how it changes settings very easily.She has no problem changing between colors or making it do the rainbow effect.It is easy to tilt and start it while on the base.I know I had read about a fragile base.We were kind of delayed in getting our daughter weened from the bottle.With this cup, she was broken within about two days.We like these cups because they wash well in the dishwasher and they don't have a bunch of parts that you have to assemble each time -- just the lid and the cup.The only complaint we have is that you have to be sure you catch the thread the right way when screwing it on because if you don't get it on right, liquid will leak out.We have mastered the cups now, we always turn it upside down once to be sure it won't leak, and we're good to go.Love these.When we cloth diapered our first child, Marvel diaper covers weren't available.These Marvel covers are amazing!I've only had this one a couple of days but it's the softest one I have.I use my other one at night over a large prefold and a small prefold as a doubler.We're ery pleased.No red marks around my boy's legs like some other covers I've tried.I know this is the most comfortable cover for my baby.It will feel warm and moist because the heat from baby is able to ventilate.The fit is great.This bag is perfect for a cloth diaper pail.Just toss in the dirty diapers and wash it with the diapers.This is the only liner I've ever used, but it really works great and I love it.It washes along with the diapers and dries fast.The elastic keeps it in place on the pail and it fits my tall kitchen trash can perfectly.And the price is great.Unfortunately, they do not work with my Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe.However, the inside rubbery part is turning yellowish.It's probably a normal part of that waterproof material, but I thought I would mention it.Otherwise, you'll have to fight with trying to get the diapers to come out.I have an expensive one in fun colors and then this one for laundry day, and this one works just the same!I have two of these bags and alternately wash them with the diapers and have never put them in the dryer, only air dried them.I don't know why I've had such a bad experience and everyone else has had great ones, but I am not a happy customer.Its not only the best one out there, but it is a steal!Works well, and keeps most of the odor contained.First time parent and this is the first wipes we purchase for our newborn.Totally happy with it.Then again, being first time parent, we change our diapers rather quickly and often so stuff don't get dried up.I don't know what the fuss is about the size being shrunk from previous version but its size are comparable to other brands from what I read.Either way, we never neatly fold them to maximize surface usage anyways.Not bleached, no fragrance, and no alcohol.The refill package is nicely designed, resealable tape stays strong and keeps the wipes moist.Oh, the smell that emanates from these wipes is unbearable.I really really don't like these wipes.They are a good size and they come out of the package easy.Started to purchase all of our household Seventh Generation items from Amazon a few months ago.Love their wipes because they are Chlorine-free with no alcohol or fragrances and gentle on skin.Love Seventh Generation products and will continue to use them for my family.We use cloth wipes at home, and only use these when out, so they are great for what I need them for.They fit well and don't irritate the skin.We've been using the 7th Generation wipes for two years now.I really don't have any complaints.They are good, gentle wipes that rate really low on the chemical scale.Occasionally I wish they were a little thicker, but most days they would great.We have used these wipes exclusively for the last two years and cannot be happier.We really wanted something unscented, and with limited chemicals due to sensitive skin and these seemed to fit the bill.They have been very gentle and we find them to be soft and sturdy.I love the 7th Gen brand & this refill pack is perfect for stocking up the plastic containers or your diaper warmer.I was using the bulb syringe that I was given at the hospital- it seems to be getting some mucus, but I felt like there was still a lot in her nose that could come out.The Nosefrida has been much more effective at removing mucus from my baby's nose, or at least it seems like it.The Nosefrida seems a little gross when you first look at it- it seems like you'll be sucking snot right into your mouth!She hates anything that involves cleaning, wiping, or otherwise messing with her face.I love it, and deep down I know she appreciates me getting the snot out of her nose.and only served to make my son angry and hysterical.The first time we tried the Nosefrida he could breathe easily!True, he didn't like it, but it was so quick and efficient- meaning I didn't have to keep trying over and over- he didn't have time to get really angry.My 5 month old son has chronic congestion and acid reflux so I was having to suction his nose out about 5-10 times a day.And believe me, when your baby has a cold and can't nurse, won't sleep and nothing will work, you will be very grateful for this item.I mean how do you wash the inside?With this I know I've rinsed all the funk out.It's really a great item.I ordered this in the "Outer Space" color.I am using this item as a laundry bag for cloth diapers.It would also make a good laundry bag for travel purposes.Love the color and think that it is neutral enough for a baby girl or boy.It holds days worth of cloth diapers.There is an extra zippered compartment on one side (this part is not sealed with the water tight lining like the larger compartment is).Waterproofing inside is great, holds the stink in.Unlike the Planet Wise Diaper Pail Liner (Orange), there's a lot more going on with this bag.In doing so, the bag captures water from the washer and 'holds' it inside.I was the kind of mom-in-training before my 1st was born that hadn't even considered cloth diapers until hearing how friends of ours had done research about the cost difference.Yes, cloth is an investment, but SO WORTH it!!I toss this bag in with the diapers to wash it and dry it and it works great.Thanks goodness!The size is great too since they hold everything we use up in a day, including the cloth wipes.I highly recommend it!!We've been using the diaper dekor plus for about two years now, and it's great.They worked well until our son hit about 10 months.I really love the Diaper Dekor Plus system.Highly recommend!It took me about 3 tries to get comfortable, but after that it was a breeze to use.My son really looks like he's taking a nap so I can maintain some level of modesty in public places without both of us sweating under a blanket.Doesn't work well and you could make one with an old t-shirt if you want to try.Love these adorable cushy straps.I bought these for my now 3 month old.We got these straps after our baby got scratched by exposed velcro from another brand.The velcro on these are well hidden and the material is super soft.They were easy to put on too.They're really cute and my son loves laying his head against them since they're really soft.It also keeps his head from falling forward which is really great (cuz first i bought the neck thing for that and it did nothing).These are very plush but too big for a newborn as they seem much to large.Seat belt straps are universally uncomfortable, and we find these to be super soft and comfy for our tiny newborn.A gentle wash prior to use is recommended, and I used a fabric softener especially for babies when I ran them through the dryer on the delicate cycle.They held together perfectly in the wash and stayed velvety soft.Very cute, very practical, and the price is right.I purchased these straps for my daughter's jogging stroller.They are easy to wash (wash in the machine and then lay out to air dry); and they are really easy to attach to the straps.The straps used to dig into his neck and hurt him.These soft pads alleviate this and now there is no issue with that.My only concern is that he chews on the heads non-stop until i turned them around so that the head is in the back.I got these not long after my son was born after finding red marks on his neck from the harness.I have only one recommendation and/or suggestion, if you get these "wash them first"... my daughter didn't do that and after the first few times of having it against his face, he started to get a little rash, just right were they touch his skin.I suggested to her that she wash them... and he hasn't had anymore rash since.Do your new infant son, daughter, grandson, granddaughter, neice or nephew a great big favor and buy them these cute little strap covers, they truly are the best!!!I considered opening them up and removing some stuffing, but never got around to it.It would be nice if the velcro were the less abrasive kind so when it did contact my little ones skin it didn't scratch it.I've owned a pair for over a year now and they have held up really well after numerous washes.This is a fantastic sippy cup.She has not taken to other cups from other companies but seems perfectly content to use this OXO sippy cup.There is also an indented lid, which makes it safe for interaction with the face of the child.The cup is top rack dishwasher safe.A cool additional feature is the ounces and milliliter conversion on the cup.Thus, if you are monitoring the fluid intakeI love OXO products because they offer comfortable grips, but this sippy cup is a cut above the rest in every aspect, including, of course, the grip on the (removable) handles.This Sippy Cup deserves our praise.For it is made sans BPA'sThis Sippy Cup is fun to hold;This Sippy Cup has colors bold;The packaging is not a chore;Like other cups at the Wal-Mart store;A rubber ring provides a seal;Cups that don't will tend to spill,But best of all, this thing is madeDishwasher Safe!Interchangeable parts!All these features, while seemingly small;Make a BIG difference while in the thrall;Of a late night venture to find for your kid,A bottle which fits with the &^#$^$#ing lid.So listen to me now, and hear me later,Just buy the dang cup, and don't be a hater.LIKE:  That you can remove the handlebars.Fortunately these ARE removable, and the cup is better for it imo.Especially given that the cup has a soft touch textured middle part, which grips very well.Great bright colors and very sturdy and well constructed sippy cup.Dishwasher safe and also ecco friendly and safe, this makes an ideal toddler cup in my opinion.Look, sippy cups are mostly the same.This one is arguably constructed better than most and it has interchangeable parts with other Oxo baby items.No big deal.Also, you can remove the handles and use this as a cup.Dishwasher safe (top rack) and the measurements clearly marked on the outside are pluses too.The measurements work better if you are using the metric system.It does have the American style too, only it corresponds to odd numbers.but our daughter absolutely loves this sippy cup.It has been a bit of a struggle to get our 11-month old daughter to use a sippy cup.When she is done she slams it back down...so the cup seems to be reasonably well-built.Why does she like it?On the verge of walking, Nickie, my test kid, is the perfect age for this Sippy Cup.The handles on the sippy cup have a rubber grip texture on them.The bands on the edges of the cup are also grip texture.The cup showed no sign of leaking, with the standard rubber piece behind the sippy cup tip preventing spills and leaks.The cup is also marked with ozs, and is see through so you can easily keep track of how much your child is drinking.An excellent cup!If you do like leaks or want the liquid flow to increase you can use this thing without the rubber stopper.2.I love that.3.There is measure in ounces and ml on the side of the cup if you are monitoring your child's fluid intake.4.The whole thing is dishwasher safe (top rack)5. the shape of the cup itself even without the handles attached really lends itself to small hands.I highly recommend this sippy cup.great cup!i love how its bpa free..its fantastic that you can seperate the handles too and modify the grip design.Let me preface this review by saying I am a HUGE OXO brand fan.My grandmother bought me a set of utensils for the kitchen by them when I got married 11 years ago and I am still using most of them.I love them!I also liked the grippy part on the sides.My tot doesn't care much for sippy cups in general yet so I can't honestly say she won't eventually love this one but overall this is her least favorite.I wasn't sure if I needed another sippy cup in my life, but I decided to give it a try and I really like this one.Pretty much every cup we have leaks, except this one.This cup has a great design and looks awesome.....BUT.....the valve on it makes it too hard for my 18 month old to drink from it.There appear to be interchangable tops and bottoms with higher capacity.I attribute this to the much higher effort it takes to drink from it.I went with OXO because I love, love, love their kitchen tools and figured that their brand has been awesome for everything else, so it was worth a try.Things I love about this cup: 1.It looks like an adult cup.Easy to wash.However, before she even had the cup 5 minutes, she had dropped it down the stairs, and then my husband went down to get it and threw it back up the stairs, and the valve did come out when he threw it (but he tossed it a good distance and it landed hard, so I don't think normal wear and tear would make the valve come out).And I did for a while, but the valves (I bought two cups) kept coming off more and more and my husband dropped it off the counter and the lid cracked all the way around the cup right above the threads.This cup has a great design and looks awesome.....BUT.....the valve on it makes it too hard for my 18 month old to drink from it.This cup has 3 parts, the cup, and the lid which consisits of a removeable guard to somewhat prevent spills and the part that screws onto the cup.Unfortunately if the lid isn't on the rim of the cup itself isn't at all smooth, enough to scrape my hand while washing the cup.I'd suggest starting out with very little water, enough for a few sips at the most, and just planning to refill it often at first.i got this cup set because i thought it would be a good value since you get a no spill sippy plus an extra training lid to transition to real cups.all of the pieces come apart easily for cleaning.i filled the cup with water and even I could not suck anything out let alone my baby.also the set does not have a convenient lid for travel like other sippy cups i bought.As another reviewer said, this is perfect for all ages.I love the fact that I can use the snack cup myself or pack it for my daughter.I have the orange color one which is very vibrant and can't be misplaced.It is perfect to put cheerios in for the little ones or for myself I put snacks such as bigger cereal (Frost Mini Wheats) and it holds a handful so you do not overeat.I feared the lid might be hard to open but it is easy to open without much effort but yet holds a wonderful seal.Anything you put in a baggie ends up smashed to pieces.In the cup, snacks are well protected.I love the cup so much I am going to but other pieces that match the set.A wonderful cup with so many purposes.This seems to be a nice quality snack cup.The lid opens a little more than 90 degrees.It also says it is top-rack dishwasher-safe.We'll be using it for snacks on the road!It would be better if it latched shut a little more sturdily...Oxo Tot Flip- Top Snack Cup is a semi- handy snack container for small children and adults as well.This snack cup holds a small portion of your favorite snack, takes up little space, and is sized just right to fit into small hands.I have two little girls and, like other youngsters, they are often in need of a snack.Giving them a large box of their favorite chip or cracker isn't a wise move, as I have discovered on more than one occasion.With a small container like this, the young ones can carry their own snack around with them and serve themselves.Since the container is small, it also limits the amount they can eat.Adults can also use this snack container and many will like it for its compact size.However, the small size is also a liability, from the perspective of an adult, because the amount of food this container can hold is very limited.Now, I realize it needs to open up fairly easily considering that children are the ones most likely to use it.But the lack of a firm seal means the flip top is likely to pop open when the cup is dropped.I love the feel of the rubberized grips and the color is great.The top has a flip up lid for easy access, but in truth, the entire top pops off way too easily.It would be better if the lid screwed on instead of just being snapped on, and I predict spills will be frequent as a result.This snack cup is great.It keeps the snacks fresh and intact while not taking up much space in my purse.The snack cup is a nice size-about the size of a small orange (I'm so scientific in my measurements).There are grips on the side if you decide to have your little one hold it him/herself and eat.All in all, I think this is a worthy investment.The rest of the lid removes with a little more force for easy cleaning in the dishwasher.I liked the rubber grips on the outside of the cup.The first is that it is a bit too wide for my son to hold comfortably in one hand.If it could have been just a little less wide he could easily hold on to it with one hand and eat with the other.Although it survived some throwing about so it seems to be durable enough.Pros:- Toddler can easily snap open lid for snacking- Top comes apart nicely for cleaning; but not easy enough that a toddler can pull it off- Durable- Rubber Grips help prevent dropsCons:- Too wide for a toddler to hold in one hand- Clear plastic feels and looks cheapOverall it is a great snack cup and I am sure it will find lots of use in our family.The cup was taken away from him because once he saw the excitement dropping his snack cup from the highchair he thought it was cute to do it over and over.I've used it for fresh fruit, fruit granola snacks, nuts, etc for myself.This item is cute, very compact, and a great idea for little tots.I like the colors that it is available in.The finger grips are nice, but I think it adds to the aesthetics more than the functionality.The pop top is not exactly the strongest, though, I"ve had it pop open when in a purse full of stuff.And I don't have to wash them.But I'd rather they charge a bit more to have a higher quality of material and build.It's a basic flip-top snack cup in various colours.(For wet snacks like apple sauce or yogurt, it would be a great size, but this snack cup isn't water-tight.The lid pops open, and there's nothing else to hold the snacks in.The design on these is great!My son is learning to eat with a fork and does really well with this set.Really happy with anything that makes the cleaning process a little easier and more efficient without sacrificing good cleanliness--nice job OXO on a solid product that delivers.The little nipple cleaner is also a nice to have.Only drawback is that the screw off nipple cleaner can come loose as you are twisting brush inside bottles, but it's not a huge issue and the advantage of having the nipple cleaner makes it worth it.I bought this bottle brush and use it as a dish brush to get inside my tall coffee travel mugs (which a regular dish brush can't fit into).It is great!I like the little stand so the brush dries nicely; will order again.)- nipple cleaner not very practical, it doesn't get into every nook and cranny i'd like, so i have to use a separate little brush for some parts- stand could be heavier/wider so it's not as easy to tip overOverall a good bottle brush and I'm happy with my purchase.I just wonder how long it will last since bristles are already getting bent out of shape.The bottle brush is really nice and the stand is a nice way to store the brush.I was hoping for a more standard type of nipple brush.Does the work absolutely beautifully.I love it.I have 2 bottle cleaners, this one and another one that is from a more widely known baby brand.The OXO one is a much better quality bottle cleaner.I would give this 5 stars but I don't like how there are bristles around the entire brush.It looks like the only company that makes brushes like that is the avent one but I like this one better because:it has it's own stand.Sometimes when I'm cleaning a bottle it unscrews itself just a little.But overall this is a great bottle cleaner.I was a little surprised by how long this bottle brush is (especially compared to the standard Munchkin one I had been using), which made it a little unwieldy at first to use since it was so much longer than really necessary.I like that it also comes with its own stand.This brush is definitely better than the munchkin, IMO.The bristles are more flexible so it is easier to get it into my dr. brown bottles.It is a piece of rubber and you have to screw and unscrew it from the bottle brush...I like those that you just pull out the brush.The only thing I like about this brush is that it stands.Like many others, I like the bristles of this brush much better than three other brands of bottle brushes I've tried.The brush is the perfect size and the bristles are flexible enough to use even on narrower tubes without getting stuck.The slightly smaller head feels more manueverable insides baby food jars and bottles.I don't know where they came up with using this design because I don't find it effective.Before buying the OXO Tot Bottle Brush, I've tried several others:Munchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush,Colors Vary,The First Years Bottle Nipple Brush, andSassy No Scratch Bottle Brush, and they were all blah.I've been using this brush for 2 months daily, and it is still going strong.The OXO is not perfect, but probably the best on the market now and certainly my favorite.)- The stand: it's sanitary, compact, and holds and releases the brush well- No foam bits or disintegrating parts to deal with, like the First Years brush- No wire parts that will rust on you, like the First Years brushWish were better:- Nipple cleanerAt first I couldn't get all the greasy residue from breastmilk off the nipples, but I have a work-around that seems to do the job.I first use the bottle brush to scrub the exterior and the interior (the brush fits the interior wide base).This is great!Awesome!We travel from Japan to US several times a year and this is a life saver!I did not expect the material to be so great!The bottom is a waterproof lining, but the top is SO soft and smooth!No complaints.Fit in my granddaughter's wheelchair stroller and her car seat perfectly.It's supposed to stop moisture from penetrating the pad through to the seat... that's it's job.The only thing I would wish for would be having the lap strap came up even higher, just in case!However, if I could give it 6 stars, I would!Although it has not been used yet it seems as though it will do a great job.My only complaint is the very strong chemical smell of the backing/packaging, and it remains even after washing.It has help cut down on the number of seat cover washes and for that I'll give it four stars.Before I bought this, I was hoping to buy something that's pretty (there are many out there with cute designs), but I am so glad I got this changing pad instead.It opens and folds very easily (closes with velcro).The size and shape is perfect for changing in the backseat of a car or in the stroller bassinet.And it's easy to clean (just wipe with the diaper wipe).I love that these are collapsible or expendable to make it fit anywhere.I bought two and mounted one end of each to the wall to make a 12 x 12 blockage in the corner.When I travel I take it with me and use it as a pen.Works great.These are a great purchase and well worth the money.love 'em!the colors are pleasing and they are easy to use and clean.don't love that they are made in china, but they claim to be made of safe plastics.the bottom is solid and non-skid.Once food is frozen, just let the tray sit in rm temp for a min, then twist gently and all the cubes come right out.They stack right on top of each other, saving space in my small freezer.This is a great must-have item for moms making baby food.I actually *thought* I would prefer a silicone one, where I could manually pop out the food and I have still yet to use one, but they're all over twice the price of this one.This one, at only $4.99 works fantastic and you loosen the frozen cubes like you would with an ice cube tray, then slide the cover (which slides very smoothly) just open enough to release however many cubes you'd like.And it is easily put away in a pantry shelf when I want to clear the counter for company.I highly recommend this product.Update 2/14/2013:  Done with babies but still using this great drying rack for wine and champagne glasses!This basket is great if you have small items that may otherwise get lost in the dishwasher.I like that it feels sturdy, and the many openings allow plenty of space for a thorough cleaning for the items inside.Most people are tired of this task, but continue to clean in this manner because they worry that the small pieces that combine to form a bottle, sippy cup, etc, will get thrown around in the dishwasher.The way it works is easy enough: You open the basket from the middle, insert bottles, nipples, lids to sippy cups, straws, and other small, fragile items.The basket keeps items safely in place while your dishwasher cleans them like it cleans other, larger items.Often, my utensil basket does not have enough room to hold all of the kitchen utensils I need to wash.I simply open the basket, place the utensils inside, on their sides, and close.Oxo has answered the wishes of many parents with this, the Oxo Tot Dishwasher Basket.It handles the tiny dishes, the bottles, the small forks and spoons, and even the little plugs on a sippy cup, keeping them safely together while they are cleaned inside your automatic dishwasher.This is a really helpful unit!If you do not have a compartment like this in your dishwasher you NEED this!It can be used on any shelf, I like the top shelf for safety against losing the proper shape etcIt has more compartments in it to hold those odd shape, or tiny bottle/ cup parts safely.They have from the units that came with the dishwasher however So I now use this as my primary baby items or any small item I am cleaning holder/ protectorIt is thicker than the units that came with my dishwasher and it has all of these different shapes to help latch items and protect them from getting lostI have nothing but good to say about this.I love it and use it dailyNormally these items are not suitable for dishwashers because they can drop to the bottom where the heating element is.These two features work together to make sure that whatever goes into the basket does not come out.In fact, we had great success using this basket to wash other items that used to fall down to the bottom occasionally.I used the dishwasher basket to hold sippy cup parts.I think this could still happen occasionally, even on the top rack.While I could lay the sippy cup lids on the top rack of the dishwasher, I really had no good way to thoroughly clean the stoppers.And even for those lids, it's nicer to find all the sippy cup pieces together in one place.Overall, I'd recommend this basket to those frequently washing sippy cups.It holds more and has a lot more features that I love!The sippy cup straw holder is perfection!It even will hold a good amount of the Dr. Browns bottle inserts that don't fit in all dishwasher baskets.The orange section above is perfect for bottle nipples and rubber sippy cup parts.It can also hold little spoons and the like.The basket fits well in my dishwasher without taking up a ton of space.It is easy to place in and remove from the dishwasher.This basket is quite the upgrade from the small hand-me-down basket I got when my son was born.I like the idea of the dual opening top which keeps things in place as I drop things in during loading.I'm not using abnormal bottle nipples either, so not sure about this design issue.Everything else goes right into the basket and stays put.Hadn't been aware that the side flip downs were for straws...wish I had read the instructions a month back when my four year old niece came to visit and used sippy straws EVERY day for a month.Overall, I like this container a good deal, though I think the nipple overlap issue is a bit of a problem.i mean its kinda hard to give a detailed review about this..its a great solid item from OXo.. i trust most of their products anyways.it holds a fairly decent amount of stuff without taking up alot of space.latch seems like it ll last a long time too.. that was our only concern.a good buy for anyone.This is a great idea and Oxo did a remarkable job in executing it.It fits very easily in the top rack of dishwasher and can adjust upto 8 pacifiers/nipples in one go.You can fit 2 bottles tightly or mostly only one inside.If only I had known how much easier my life could have been...This basket is simply awesome.From the day you bring your baby home, this is a useful item."But even with a two year-old, this is an absolutely brilliant item to have.The rubber nubs inside the top of your sippy-cups?Totally safe.I find it perfect for pump parts, but largish bottle nipples don't fit in it at all.This dishwasher basket is a must have for anyone that has to wash small baby items like nipple holders, sippy cup tops, etc.I think it's awesome that the basket is BPA-free; nothing fell out during the wash and the openings were wide enough for everything to get cleaned well.Seriously ingenious item - it's cheap, convenient and will save you from digging around the bottom of the dishwater for tiny items.I've also used it for non-baby items such as bottle lids, tea infusers, water bottle caps, etc.I put all the valves in this think basket and the sippy tops are fine to just go with the rest of my glasses on the top rack.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because I wish it was slightly larger so that I could fit more valves or even the actual lids inside it.It would be perfect if they sold these in 2 packs!Works really well.This diaper has separate adjustments for waist and leg, so it's perfect!I love to use Mother-ease Sandy's cloth diapers!They are especially great for tall/long babies because they have a nice high rise.We love these seats - they are attractive, well built, have two cupholders for convenience, my kids say they are comfortable, and they have a good safety reputation.We were very thankful.The Frontier 85 seemed the next logical step.After extensive research on line, we narrowed our choice down to the Frontier 85 vs. the Graco Nautilus, which we have in my mother's car (she picks our kids up sometimes).+'s:- Room to grow on the 5 point harness height (almost 20"): My son, at 3 1/2, has a torso length the same as my 5 1/2 year old daughter.The online video for installation takes all of two minutes, and my personal install was not much longer- Comfort - My kids think these are much more comfortable than the Sunshine Kids seats (they complain about the belts on those being uncomfortable) and Graco Nautilus (thin padding, uncomfortable for long rides)-'s:-  Installation with seatbelts - have read that the seatbelt based installation once you are over the latch weight limit is a real pain...I have read online that they can be prone to breakage- Must unLATCH seats to adjust height - inconvenient, but understand, given how it is designed.It is nice that some seats actually have a dial you can adjust without taking seat out.All in all, the best seat on the market IMHO and we love it!We've been using the seat for 4 months now and I only have a few complaints about it.We bought this for our tall torsoed 5 year old son.He also finds it very comfortable, more than his booster.Our son has just grown out of his Britax Roundabout.The fit was not nearly as tight as it should have been.I then decided to try the LATCH and it was beautifully secure in about 2 minutes.).Overall I am very pleased.The seat is comfortable and roomy, and my son enjoys the armrests and cup holders (although I feel they could be a little higher up).Most of all, I feel good about the Britax brand and my son's safety in this booster seat.I love it but my 5 1/2 yr old isn't as thrilled.Otherwise, it's easy enough to install, fits well in all the seating positions I've tried although makes it hard for me to see out the back window when placed in the 3rd row of our SUV.Nice that he can be in a 5-pt longer since he wiggles out of a belt positioning booster still at his age.I also love that this seat is still made in the USA.I thought it would be another over priced baby item that didn't live up to it's claims.My son is gigantic for his age.He just turned 2 in August and is 40" an 40 lbs therefore his convertible seat no longer held him.I agonized over the price and some of the other higher weight class 5pt harness seats.This seat is excellent.The craftsmanship, attention to detail, tactile feel of materials etc are noticeably of a higher standard.Our son loves to be in the seat looking out the window like a big boy!Bonus - these seat comes with cup holders (a must for us)!Awesome product, we highly recommended it.The furthest crotch strap slot on the Graco Nautilus measured at 6.5 inches from the back of the seat.My son was almost sitting on the Graco crotch strap in its furthest position and he's only 10 months and SKINNY.When I put my son in the Britax Frontier 85, his back and head were straight and aligned (no curving of the spine).In the Graco Nautilus, my son was hunchback cause the seat or headrest pushed his head forward and curved his spine.The material on the Britax Frontier 85 is sooo soft and smooth, but still SAFE (rock hard on the outside, cushiony on the inside).I highly doubt that!BUT the harness strap on the Britax Frontier 85 is LONG!!!!!And here's the best part -- I'M HIS MOTHER AND I WAS ABLE TO SIT IN THE SEAT AND STRAP MYSELF IN!Most importantly, the crotch strap was still NOT under me.That means my son can grow to my size and still remain harnessed!Not that he'll need to be harnessed when he's my size, but the option is there!He loves it!Go for the Britax Frontier 85 over the Graco Nautilus... you will thank me!I still love it very much!!!And because I loved it so much, I decided to go for the Britax Marathon 70 -- also a fantastic car seat for my 10 month old son.I will be purchasing the Britax Frontier 85 in the future for sure, unless Britax comes out with an even better model by then!My 5-year-old (45", 41 lbs) had outgrown her Evenflo Generations in harness mode and her 3-year-old sister was ready to move up to them (her Evenflo Triumphs passed their expiration date).I did a little research and found that this seat not only felt sturdy, but that I could keep her in a safer harness for longer.We set the crotch strap in the second position - she is comfortable now and still has room to grow to the third position later.We still have several positions left for the top harness - I think we set her at around 17.5".We already took our first road trip and when she nodded off, her head stayed upright (while her little sister in the Generations seat had her head flopping to the side - something that hadn't been happening in her Triumph), which I was really impressed with.After months of researching car seats for my 2 1/2 year old son I finally decided on Britax.I have never owned a Britax, admittedly because of the cost, but decided that I just couldnt put a price on my childs safety.I love that it has side impact protection.This seat was super easy to install.(I used the LATCH system).Definitely the easiest seat Ive ever installed.Its super easy to adjust to any size child.This seat will definitely grow with my child & should be the last seat we ever need.My son seems really comfortable in it & its really soft.I like that the seat converts to a booster and is as big as it is.I am definitely happy with the seat - it is much more comfortable for my son.The one (minor) complaint that I have is that the shoulder straps are close enough together that they were irritating my son's neck occasionally - the fix for this is easy though, just velcro some fabric around it and then it doesn't rub.Makes it easy to carry it all, but it doesn't really keep it cold all day.I loved that there is a mesh pocket in the inside to hold items.I am going to purchase (from amazon) the matching dog backpack for my son's diapers & wipes and toys.It did a pretty good job for the 3hrs i used it that day.Okay, this thing is adorable.The best part is that it actually keeps things cold if you put a cold pack in with your food.Just know that it's small - more appropriate for a little kid with a little appetite - of course I think that's who it's made for, so it's perfect.Would be a very fun gift for any kid.The lunch box is small but perfect for my needs.Anyways, I bought these and thought they were great.I use them all the time and then never get ratty like my bottle brushes.I alternate between straw cups and spout cups so this set was perfect for me.These shades are great.My only complaint was that the shipping time was INCREDIBLY SLOW.You may need to cut it size if you prefer.Comes in a pair.They are a bit tricky to install.These will make great washclothes and are good for wiping hands and faces, but as wipes, they are way too thick and the two plys aren't sewn together tight enough...I do love how soft they are, wish I could find something this soft but one ply.These are my favorite wipes I own.The down side, if there was one, would be that you can't get as many of these in the Lionheart wipe warmer as you can the flannel or bamboo wipes.This stool is great!The other is in the kitchen for her to "help cook" and to turn lights on and off.She carries it around to different rooms as she needs it.She loves it!Overall very pleased with this!Just ordered one to keep at my parent's house for when we visit them :)This step stool is perfect.The picture on Amazon makes the top of the stool look like it's a different color than the rest of the stool, but it's not...same color as the legs, it's just the non-slip texture reflecting in the flash.This is my fourth BabyBjorn carrier over the years with my child and grandchildren.It is also comfortable.This one has wide, well padded straps that after an hour or so of walking were still comfortable.Wonderfully comfortable after a long walk.Another thing I like about this carrier is the ease in which it assembles.So I was very concerned that this one not do the same restrictive circulation grip that the other one did.She assured me that it was comfy and not tightly binding her legs.The carrier is designed to have baby facing forward or out depending on your preference and the baby's weight, this makes it a double duty item in baby's repertoire of needed equipment for comfort, safety and fun.I have to say that I absolutely love it.The color is great.As with the Original, I love that each strap stays in place and feels very secure.At first I worried that this strap would feel awkward and cumbersome, but it is actually very comfortable and, I believe, a great improvement on the Original.Nothing unbearable, but it wasn't pleasant.With the Comfort Carrier, though, I don't feel any soreness when I walk around with my son.From my experience, I think that the Comfort Carrier sets itself apart from the Original because it is more supportive and comfortable.Since I use a carrier ALL the time, that is an important feature for me, and the extra cost is worth it.The shoulder straps are wide and comfortable.It is easy to get him in and out of it.My son is only 3 months old and sucks on everything near his mouth.The terry cloth cover for the straps is a nice and useful touch.Ergonomic design, organic cotton and removable terry cloth bib are a few of the bells and whistles that make this carrier appealing to me.The carrier's ergonomic design makes for maximum parental comfort, even with a larger child.I was pretty disappointed when I wasn't able to carry my first son in our Original BabyBjorn because he outgrew it so quickly.BabyBjorn Comfort Carrier offers two flexible carrying positions - inward or outward.You can also adjust the leg and arm positions to fit the carrying style and size of your child.On that note, be sure to use the wide leg, inward facing position for children between 26 and 31 lbs.For your child's safety, please read all instructions before your first use.Comfy!Adjustable waist belt and shoulder strap allow you to distribute the weight of your child evenly and makes for a comfortable rideFlexible sizing, fitting men and women (small to extra large)100% organically grown cotton, so more environmentally friendly - this is a plus in my book!Oeko-Tex approved and guaranteed free from health-hazardous substances, which is great peace of mind when baby starts to gnaw when teethingRemovable/washable terry bib to keep the slobber under controlSturdy construction and classic lookCons:Expensive, but worth it if you will use regularly/for long distances and you're prone to any kind of lower back painBulkier than the other modelsWith so many great features, the BabyBjorn Comfort Carrier raises the standard for infant carriers, making it well worth the price.BUT we used a BB for my son 9 years ago when he was born, and I'll tell you, BABYBJORN has come a long way!I love that this carrier is so adjustable, because my husband is quite a bit smaller than I am, and it can easily fit both of us.You can pull on the waist straps to adjust them better after you buckle the back.I can't accurately describe them, but they are so easy to use!The buckles/straps on the front to adjust for the size of your baby are easy to use, too.The waist is very padded, as are the straps, and the fabric is very soft.I love that!I see myself using it often, and my husband sees himself using it a lot, too.It is very nice and we now like that it can go on your back, but it is not as easy to use as the original bjorn and the baby cannot face out.My son really like using the original bjorn and facing out but he is getting a bit large for that one (21 lb) and we thought that since this one says it goes up to 30lb would give it a try.It is very comfortable for both us and the baby.Our little boy seems to love riding in it and it is very comfortable for both me (5'2" and my husband 6').The original bjorn holds a small baby the easiest.I also like that it's circular instead of square.It's a good size and easy to clean.Does it's job well-- almost too well.The pattern hides stains and sometimes bits of food that I don't notice because of the dark background.I really love the way this looks and fits.I love the extra "flaps" of coverage in the legs.I love that the inside cleans up so easily and it can be reused a few times before washing it.They do have a tag in the back that needs to be tucked in (you can cut it off though...)  My mom bought 3 white colored covers that stain a little around the legs but seem to fade out after a few washes.and unlike the velcro ones these don't have a slot in the front to slide the diaper into to hold into place.ill recomend them if your baby isn't small and i mean small as in 7 months old and only 13lbs.and this company by far makes the cutest colors and patterns i have the mango the red the purple and the striped and flowered ones i love them all.i use it, but it isn't my first choice when i'm cloth diapering.They don't leak unless the soaker is absolutely saturated, and I love that I am not spending time stuffing pockets any more.It fits really well and comes in great colors that stand up to all the washing.I got a couple of these to use with flat-fold diapers until my newborn would fit into the all-in-one diapers we bought.Great purchase and I will be getting more soon!I'm new to cloth diapering and have decided to do the good old fashioned prefold method.So when I had to get the covers, I purchased a couple of each of the most popular brands, only going based on other people's reviews.I absolutely love these Thirsties.So far, these are the only covers that are true to size and actually fit my daughter when she was a newborn.My girl was 7lbs2oz when born and these covers were perfect for that time when you have to be careful of the umbilical cord.I purchased newborn sizes in other brands and they were huge.The thirsties fit right below her belly button to keep from rubbing up against it.Even when the prefold has been completely soaked, the cover has held up great.I'll be purchasing more of these, especially since they're so inexpensive.Update after 6 months of use:These are still great economical covers, but they definitely don't go up to 18lbs.I'll just need to get the next size up.I use this over a prefold just trifolded and laid inside.I love it!It has been very effective as a cover for my son!Sometimes if his wool isn't dry at night, I use it with 2 prefolds laid inside for nighttime.The lavender smell is too strong for me so I took the pouch out, which is good that you can remove it if you want to.The surprisingly educational whale pail has become a bath essential.Not only do my kids have fun scooping up their bath toys, it has become their favorite bath toy.It enlivens bath time four both my one and four year old.This is one item you never knew you need but will end up using constantly.The size of the holes in this pail are big enough to get an effective stream but small enough to give you the shower, rather than the dumping, effect.4) Everything I do with it, I can do one-handed.I would highly recommend this product for new parents who are looking to enjoy a safe bath playtime with their little ones.My other OXO item in this 'genre' is a sippy cup.Of course I have plenty of OXO kitchen gadgets that I love.Second, this isn't a novel item.It keeps our sons' bath toys very neat and somewhat organized.He doesn't like when we use it to wash his hair.In addition, it's great to be able to see through the little window to see some of the toys inside the pail.However, my only complaint is that the suction cups last for a couple of hours on our tiles and then the next thing you hear is a crash from the bathroom as the entire pail w/ it's suction cups comes tumbling down into the bath tub.It comes with two different ways to connect it to the wall- suction cups and adhesive.Amazingly, I found them to hold really well.the 'whale pail' connects simply to the suction cup holder attached to the wall, helps toys dry out quickly, and doubles as a toy itself!All in all, this does what it promises and even a bit more!The Oxo Tot Whale Pail is AWESOME!Easy to install, easy to use.Highly recommend!I had been holding off buying a bathtub toy holder because in my experience they always leave me wanting for better suction.I find this whale pail to have adequate space for all my infant son's squirty toys and pouring cups.It comes with two options for mounting, the typical suction cup and a more permanent adhesive option.I then tried the suction cup mount which is a separate panel that you place on the shower wall and gives the "whale" a place to hook onto when not in use.It was fine at first, but within 15 minutes I heard the crash of it falling into the shower.It's pretty small.Forget about the easy scooping of the toys when bath time is done.All it is is a fancy bucket that will take up space.overall i feel that this is an excellent way to store bath toys and should be considered over the popular Boon bath organizer.I highly recommend this item and would buy it for others.I think it would make a great baby shower gift.It comes in a great big box.Very sweet itemMy kids love to play in the tub.We chose the suction cup for flexibility.My 4 year old daughter loves making the whale eat her bath toys!I love not having to argue about cleaning up at the end of bath time.I love the whale pail.I hope the adhesive will remove easily when we move.The suction cups didn't work well on our tile.Not anymore.I give each child a chance to see who can get the whale to "eat" the most toys.After they get to scoop the toys out they have to count them as they place them into the big buckets.So not only is clean-up time fun it is also educational.The Whale Pail has been a HUGE hit with the kids and other camp counselors.Clean-up is almost as much fun for them as the actual playtime...and all the while they're learning to take turns, count, engage with other campers, etc.Summary: surprisingly large, good for it's intended use, also good for cleaning up Legos and other small toys.I was surprised at how large this is - the pictures don't really give a good reference for scale.The mouth is perhaps 8" x 4".Given that this is one of the few strollers on the market that takes 2 infant car seats, it's a perfect option for twins.I highly recommend this stroller for someone with twins.This is the best double stroller out there to date.I LOVE this stroller!I've tried so many doubles that I've lost track, and I've hated them all.Not this one!The Chicco Together looks stylish and cool.The stroller frame seems to be sturdy and stable, and there aren't a lot of pieces on the stroller that will break.The stroller is tall, which makes it easy to get into the basket underneath.I put it on the middle setting and my husband puts it on the tallest setting and we're both comfortable pushing the stroller (I'm 5'5", he's 6'3").The wheels on the stroller have a little bit of cush to them - they're not completely hard, which makes for a nice ride for the kids.It is very easy to push, and the steering is phenomenal.The seats are on the smaller side, 14" wide, which I prefer.My 45 lb 4 year old would fit in them, but they're not huge.They are 6 months (23 lbs) and 2 1/2 years (28 lbs) and they are very comfortable in the seats.I like the five point harnesses, and the buckles seem to be good and sturdy.without me being afraid she's going to bite a piece of foam off.You don't have to flip a switch or a lever to make it stay.It is compact, while still having enough space for kids and bags.The fabric is well stitched and feels like it will hold up really well.Overall, I am absolutely loving this stroller.Easy to push, easy to steer, sylish, comfortable, and great!This is an excellent stroller if you have twins and two Chicco key fit carseats.So, after much research, I found this stroller, which is the only stroller to accept two keyfit carseats.The red color is great, and while the stroller itself is pretty big and heavy, I can lift in in and out of the back of my Honda CRV with no assistance (I am a petite person).If you have a small trunk though, it might not fit.Highly reccomended.But when our daughter was 2.5 years and our son was four months we were taking a month long trip abroad, and I knew we wouldn't be able to corral both kids without one.The Cortina Together worked wonderfully for what we needed.I knew a sit and stand would be lighter, but didn't want my two-year-old to have to stand or sit on an uncomfortable, tiny seat all the time.I love that you can place it in the front seat or back seat.It is also a great feature that the rear seat fully reclines.This is nice for a napping toddler, and makes a great bassinet for a sleeping baby.The basket underneath is very large and very accessible.Adding the zippered front is a huge help, to be able to access things even when the back seat is fully reclined.If our daughter dropped anything, it caught it, which is nice when you are running to catch a train, and not keeping track of everything!The canopies work well.A con, however, is that there are no cup holders for the back seat.And the two cup holders on the front can be switched which is nice.But this is super easy to adjust.The seats move very easily as well - one hand adjustment.The brakes and wheel locks are great and easy too.Even with its large size, the stroller turns on a dime.It's great for on the go, easy to set up - no adjustments needed.The stroller proved to be very durable - considering we hauled it on and off planes and trains, as well as up and down cobblestone streets and off-road.The feature that allows it to still roll when folded is nice, but obviously doesn't help when you are going up stairs.I truly love this stroller, and I would highly recommend it to anyone.My son also enjoys getting his but sprayed, its pretty funny.I found the scent light and pleasant.Great bottle!I bought these glass bottles because of the BPA concern and the gas prevention system.I think they are great, I didn't have to look for any other.The glass is really sturdy and can take many falls on the ground, no breaking yet.I don't think you need to hassle with bottle sleeves either.This fan works well at creating a breeze to keep your lil one comfortable.It is marketed to be a stroller fan, and it does a wonderful job at that, but we primarily use it in our car.We have an SUV with dark interior that is not quick to cool down in the back seats durring the summer months.Since the vehicles air vents all point back, and so does the car seat, our daughter was getting uncomfortable from never getting a cool breeze on her face.We clamped this to the back head rest post and it does a great job of keeping her cooler while the A/C fights to counter our Sacramento Valley summer highs.The foam blades won't harm tiny fingers and the motor is strong enough to really get the air moving.I took 2 stars off for its hardy appetite for batteries, but added a star back because the battery compartment is screwed down; if our daughter does get ahold of it, there is no way she can accidentally get the batteries out and in her mouth unless she has also found a tiny phillips head screwdriver.I wish I had gotten this sooner, as my now 3 1/2 mo old LOVES hers!I just ordered 2 more for my sisters in law & their babies.I love how versatile it is too.The pros greatly outweigh cons!!I'm not happy about that, but my baby is comfortable and sleeps on it very well, so it's not bothering him.The size of the mattress fits our standard size crib very well and it has the right firmness.Well what else do you expect from Gerber but the best?Simple but very nice.These are some of the most affordable "burp" cloths available on Amazon.com which is why I bought them.I prefer burp cloths that are generously sized to the point where you can fold over in half and go pretty far down your back.Nothing exotic of fancy.They get the job done, wash well, and are plenty soft.No complaints.We purchased these in the neutral color since we didn't know the gender of the baby before the birth.Since our baby doesn't spit up that much, we get a good use out of them before washing.They've already been through several washes and they are still soft and have held together well.I found these burp cloths to be a good size, soft and absorbent; so they work as expected for burp cloths.This occurred with the very first wash (the cloths had not even been used at that point - I wash everything first) on two of the cloths and more have started to unravel since then.If I wanted to go entirely eco-conscious, I would image these would work great as cloth wipes.As for its intended use as baby wash cloths, I prefer to use something a bit more plush and substantial.After having them for a few months now, they are overall the best wipes we have.Other baby towels have very thick edges from the stitching, not these.Nice soft colors.A little tinner them I hoped for but they wash the babyIt usually only takes 1 wipe per change (as opposed to the disposables), and they aren't as rough on the baby.So far they have withstood many many washings, and we use these combined with thePrince Lionheart Warmies Wipes Warmer(these are much better than the "Warmies" wipes they come with).After repeated washes, the edges do start to curl, but they still serve their purpose and spend most of their time in the warmer anyhow.I love them!They're super soft and so far they've held up well in the wash (I've been using them for 9 months).So many people bought me washcloths and I prefer these the most.They have no additional edges are very soft.Love these BPA free bottles - they are nice and light.Fast shipping.The bibs are well made and not too tight on my daughter's neck.They do spin around, but she manages to do that even with tighter bibs that we have.They absorb moisture well, and wash well.Very happy with purchase.I love these bibs and want to make some of my own from the pattern, but in a slightly larger size.I use Zout on the spit up stains B4 each wash and they still look almost brand new except that the applique on the Velcro part is a little curled from washing.I would recommend these to ANYONE who wants cute, good size bibs that are easy to get off.PLUS the Velcro part is large enough that I can adjust the neck size and these will grow with him for a while.These are great!Easy to put on, good quality, and very cute!The side closure makes them easy to put on and easy to take off and they soak up moisture fairly well.They're really much better than the traditional bibs and I like to use these whenever I can.We now have several of these in colors and patterns.All I can say is these are WONDERFUL.The Velcro makes it so much easier to get a perfect fit.would be a very nice cost savings.As far as washing, we're using oxygenated bleach (oxy) in a bucket to soak (and avoid stains), and then just toss them in the wash.They dry nicely, and quickly, because the insert pulls out, to give more drying area.If you go this route, you won't regret it.UPDATE: Our daughter is now just shy of 18 months (24 lbs), and still fits in these diapers nicely.We've taken to adding an additional cloth insert, inside the pocket, to absorb the larger volume at night.Other than that, we're still very pleased.Besides the fun bold colors (which never fade or run... wash to dryer), they are exactly what you want in a diaper.I have a long skinny 10 month old son... these are the perfect fit from waist to legs to crotch.They are also a better over all fit than the very popular BumGenius.The gDiaper has to be bought in various sizes & it often times was too tight int he waist or too loose in the leg.And they are also adjustable between small, medium, & large so they are able to grow with your child & move to another in the future!They are even a great fit on my friend's chunkier little girl!I didn't think I would like an attached liner, but instead I am in love with the attached liner.No stuffing (unless you want) or un-stuffing to wash or dry.Very nice!They are wider than the standard tab & they overlap to secure the diaper on a small infant.They also have the inside area to press the tabs on when washing to prevent then from being ruined in the wash... and strong!So easy to use!!I love the attached liner.The colors are so beautiful and vibrant and stay bright and vibrant after much use.I bought this for my son, now 15 months, when he was about 7 months old.He owns this one and a monkey and he loves loves loves them both!!People find it hilarious when they see hWe love the Wubbanub!We got so many compliments on it from the nurses.It's easy to find, easy to clean, and comforting for baby!I purchased her a paci plushie and I much prefer that because you can use any pacifier and it separates so you can wash them separately.WHo wants to wash your childs paci in the same place you wash your dirty socks!Wubbanubs have been wonderful for my little one.He loves them and his Soothies, so I had no problem with the Soothie being attached.And even though he's still a little young to fully grasp them, they're big enough for him to hug easily and hold on to them that way.It's been great not to have to worry about pacis falling on the floor.This one is probably the skinniest of the ones that he has, so it's easy to stuff into places.We have the cat(4 of them) and the pony!She loves to cuddle with wubbie and it's easy for her to put in her mouth.I highly recommend these!Very durable and easy to wash also!Just throw it in the wash on a gentle cycle then air dry!Adorable, easy to hold/grasp.If your child uses this brand of pacifier it is a perfect combination.My son loves his Wubbanubs - he has five different ones, the giraffe being the newest.He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part.That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up.I highly recommend Wubbanubs!This kit comes with three different nipple shield size so its easier to find a fit.It makes a beeping sound during suction, which is pretty noticeable.The hospital-grade Symphony is truly almost silent (I wonder if the travel version is also this way?).Whenever I turn it on my family all looks at me and says "What is that beeping?"and then they realize, oh yeah, mom is pumping.As for the tote, it has space for pens and cards and other items so you can use it as a purse, but unlike other reviews, don't expect to fit a ton of other things in it.You can fit a lot inside and the ice packs are easy to manage in the freezer and they keep the mild cold all day (at least 8 hours) and by then are even still partially frozen.Yes, its adorable but its not going to last long.It has held up well in the washer and dryer and it holds moisture and odors in well.I ended up putting some ribbon through the label so I could hang it on my son's dresser.I've been looking at tons of different brands, etc for a great diaper bag, and accessories such as a wallet/ food tote but couldn't find anything that met the requirements (even in very high end designer bags) until I happened upon Ju Ju Be brand.This wallet is the perfect accessory to the Ju Ju Be bags!Their Be Rich wallet is the perfect companion to many of the Ju Ju Be diaper bags (I have the BFF and the wallet fits great in the Mommy pocket), but is also a great wallet to use in general apart from the diaper bag.The change/cash pocket on the outside is well designed for quick access.The colors are vivid and the washcloths are very soft.My only complaint is that when you take the packaging off, if you aren't careful it pulls some of the strings up.Easily fixable with a small pair of scissors but still.. something to be aware of as it might be an indication of quality.I haven't used them yet but they seem capable of their purpose!They are a good size and soft.Great shipping and price!Perfect size and much cheaper than the others I have bought for my baby!These are the SAME size and quality as the Gerber washcloths I bought before.Arrived next day with amazon prime!Very happy, I bought two.Luckily she had extra fabric laying around that she was able to use, so we just had to buy the zipper tape (from newport news).If you want multiple pillowcases & know someone who is crafty, I would suggest buying just 1 pillowcase & use it as a pattern to make more of your own.I just got this yesterday and last night I loved it.It's only been one night with it, so I'll have to continue using it to see how it goes.I was very comfortable using it and I felt like the footprint of the pillow was not much bigger then the space I normally use on my side of the bed.I love this pillow!I don't want to give it up even after I have the baby.It has made sleeping a dream (pun intended).It's great!Very comfortable!Hence, I'm happy with this purchase.This is a perfect fit for my Jeep jogger, easy to put on when it started raining and easy to pack away too.I always turn the lid upside down and make sure the nipple is in there correctly.But regardless, my son LOVES these because the nipple is soft and he can chew on it.It's a great transition from bottle to sippy.It is a good size and the reflection is very clear.She prefers things with color, lights, and sounds.I read the previous reviews on these pacifiers and bought a dozen of them.Word of advice- don't.My son will NOT use them.I bought two of these cups in my local pharmacy, thinking that (1) the lid was one piece, so no more annoying valves to reunite with lids and (2) the rim was more similar to a regular cup than the usual spout or straw, so it would help my 2yo's eventual transition from sippy cups.On the second point, I'm hopeful.The top is two pieces: the colored plastic rim plus a large silicone insert that is a major PITA to remove and reinsert.Because who doesn't enjoy handwashing the sippy cups right along with great-aunt Mildred's Limoges.OK, I'm all done hatin' now.They feel nice and solid in general and are smooth and pleasing to hold.And the graphics are my son's favorite of all his cups right now.My daughter loves icee pops so I had to purchase these.I loved this bath mat because of the shape, but have definitely not loved the size.It is a beautiful bag and I love the canvas material it is made of.It seems light and sturdy.The bag weights about 2.8 LB including all straps and changing pad.You can also store the messenger strap in this pocket.Nice and neat.The side pockets can accommodate 17oz water bottles, although if you put one bottle each side, it may take away a little space away from the main compartment.I love the additional outside front pocket -- a good mommy pocket if you don't mind your smart phone near the magnets.I love the 2 stationary insulated bottle pockets inside, again large enough even for adult water bottles.They may not bother you.Another minor complaint i have is  it takes two efforts with one hand or takes 2 hands to close both flaps, because each flap has 2 small magnets at the corners.That is how big it is... not very big but it's deep.It is because of the 2 inside insulated bottle holders taking up space.I can fit a full-day outing's worth of diapers (cloth with covers), blanket, wipes, hat, cream, etc.With the Uppa snug seat my baby has great head support also super snug  and very comfortable.Now I don't worry about my baby slipping out or feeling uncomfortable.Updated Post:I initially had a poor experience with WSEI, however they have fixed all of the issues.The new pictures are accurate to what I received in the mail.Good customer service, if just a little delayed.Original Post:I'm sure the bottles were functional, but I bought them believing they would be the same as my other Medela bottles.While my 6 year old legally doesn't need a booster chair anymore, the booster chair makes small children more comfortable by helping them see out the window, and preventing the seat belt from cutting into their necks, and holding their drinks.One of the great things about this chair is that the back is adjustable for growing children.In addition, the cushion is extremely comfortable.i mean this fits my son very well when he sits in the seat.we LOVE the cup holders.i agree with other reviewers that the cups holders, as simple an idea as it is, is the best part.if you want a top of the line, sturdy, well fitted car seat - this is for you.it folds up well, has little bells and whistles all over, and actually looks great in my suv.trust me - take a chance on this!I would recommend keeping the seat belt over it to prevent this from happening.The Pathway B570 is a belt booster.My kids had a bit of trouble with that, and they are easily loosened.The armrests fold up nicely, incase you need a little extra room.The color is nice, but it gets hot fast in the sun.The fabric is not that soft and my kids found it less comfortable.....let me mention that I am comparing this to the Britax Frontier.It is more solid, softer, and has a 5-point harness.The Pathway folds nicely and stays folded, though opening it at first I thought I was going to break it because I had to use a lot of force to open it.Once folded, it is not the easy to carry, and can be a bit awkward.It fits easily in my trunk, and because it folds, stowing it is simple....in fact, I think it could fit in a plane overhead compartment.This is great if you are traveling and want to bring a good booster with you.With the cost of renting a car seat from the car rental company's, bringing this along is worth it!The seat back does extend up to grow with your child.For the price, the Pathway has good features and good value.First of all I have to point out that the style and comfort of this booster was a major hit with my 5 year old!The dual cupholders rotate out when needed.Really, I couldn't be more pleased.This lack of vision is a complaint for many children and why there are so many arguments about who will sit by the window.But with the Pathway/First Years, the child is high enough to see out all windows.It is easy to use and easy to install.The seat folds up when not in use or moving from one vehicle to another.And, the headrest is adjustable to fit the child and the seat back is adjustable to fit the incline of the vehicle seat.Another excellent feature is the adjustable seat belt guide.Just after I got this booster seat, I read that it was one of the best in a recent test.That's a huge comfort to me when choosing a seat for my child.We got a Compass booster seat about four years ago for another child and we were very happy with it.It says they are dishwasher safe, but I hand wash mine.The seat belt fits nicely into place with the guides and it looks like my child is buckled as securely as she can be.Overall, it does the job and I couldn't be happier with its performance.I purchased the Orbit infant stroller system a year and a half ago.You would think that the seat should be anchored so that the entire back of the seat won't lift up when a child sits up but that is not the case.I have been using this for about 5 months now, and I love it!Honestly, I think all of the brands are probably about the same on quality, but I do recommend this.it is so much easier than managing a blanketThis is the only monitor that we purchased and it has been working great.It's super sensitive and picks up every sound the baby makes.The volume control can be adjusted so that you don't hear the non-urgent sounds.My only complaint is that light of the parent unit is extremely bright and tough to block out if you need your room to be very dark for sleeping.I love this changing pad cover.The material is super soft velour, and the colors are gender neutral earthtones which matches our baby's room perfectly even though we do not have the Laguna bedding set.It looks great and is easy to wash & dry.Love it!At first our baby girl was not paying much attention to it, I think because the rattling noise is very quiet.I think it is because it has the face drawn on it, and babies are very attracted to faces.We were having trouble deciding what to get our new baby boy for Christmas this year.When we came across this adorable teething rattle we thought it would be just perfect for him.This little teething rattle was exactly what we expected and we are very pleased with our purchase.This rattle does rattle and it is very colorful, so it will be sure to keep his attention, it also has a top that is made for teething so it will give him something to chew on.This rattle is great!The shape of it makes it easy for my son to hold and bring to his mouth.He loves chewing on it because it's not too soft and it's not too hard.None the less he loves it.It is easy to grip, good quality, and the colors are pleasing to look at.However, my "one size" diapers were way too big.I found these on Amazon, and decided to give them a go.My baby is just now growing out of them at almost 13 pounds (3 1/2 months), and I am sad to have to move into my already-purchased larger size diapers.If they made them with leg gussets, I think they would be pretty close to the perfect diaper at the perfect price (I'd even pay a bit more for the gussets!).This sleepsack worked out great, and I ended up buying the next size up when my son grew out of the M.  When I couldn't find the size M in my stash of baby stuff I was fully prepared to order a new one.Note that my original review said the size M seemed to run small, but more recent reviews and comments seem to indicate that the current sizing is different now.Original review:This sleepsack is nice and warm, and easy to get on and off with the shoulder snaps.It is actually fluffier than I expected and seems quite cozy.It doesn't have a lot more room for him to grow, and I'm not sure it will fit for another 4 months.I bought it to replace a Halo sleepsack which was not warm enough for winter in our house.My son could easily walk around in the Halo sack since it is relatively wide at the bottom.), but I still think the lack of mobility in it is going to be a problem.I would give it more stars if the cut was more generous in terms of sizing and allowing for mobility.I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old.He is now 7 months and still loves it!This item has a few options.First the yellow bird lights up as a night light for a minute or two when you press the button.It has the on/off switch and low/high volume.There is an easy access play button so if it shuts off and you want to turn it back on again you just press the play button.And this one maneuvers pretty easily too.I decided to go with the ultralight model instead of the normal caboose because I decided that I did not need to be lifting or pushing any more weight than I already am with my girls!My son loves this walker.The tray is also deep enough that my son can move his cereal around without knocking it out of the tray.They don't seem to be super high quality, but they provide a little bit of extra stimulation.Most of the appeal, though, seems to be in the freedom that it provides for my son.The safety grips on the bottom of the walker seem to work well.Very nice:)I bought the pink 3-pack for my 6 month old.To be fair, I haven't used these yet (I'm washing them first)...but I don't know if I'm going to love them based on the fabric feel and size.The ears crinkle to the touch, and there is the additional texture of the ribbon "bamboo" the panda is holding.The back side is a pretty red satin which is another texture.This is a great rattle for a great price.Our son is only 2 1/2 months old so he's not holding and playing with things just yet really, but he likes for us to hold it in front of him and make it rattle.I've gone there while they are feeding the baby and felt how tight the cap was after taking over.They work great at home though.But when i put the seat in there jsut wasn't enough hight with the ceiling.. i hit my daughter's head trying to get her in & out.I could see out hte window ok with it reclined, but i couldn't see her AT ALL.the seat was so big.. She did find it very confy though.but i had the straps adjusted all the way down for my 8 & 1/2 month old & she was 17.5lbs & 28 inches at the time.. she's not a small kid.did need a towel for rear facing though..I went back and forth between this seat and the Britax boulevard 70.As a trauma nurse, I like the head rests much better than the Britax.I also use the pockets for the straps quite a bit more than I thought I would, they are super helpful when trying to position a struggling child.I don't love that the lowest buckle always slides back to his butt when trying to strap him in.The straps do seem to twist somewhat, but no more than when I buckled him into the Britax.Although it states that the minimum weight is 5 lbs, he would have been much too tiny for the straps to be positioned correctly.Lastly, And maybe most important.I'm confident that I can keep him reversed well past 2 with this carseat.Also, I recently put this in the minuscule back seat of my subaru and it fit wonderfully.Easy to position, took up less space than the infant car seat did.Still LOVE this seat.Addendum 2: 2013- I have since purchased a second proride for my second child.Still love it!(Don't wash your straps tho!)They are quite deep (my 2nd has to lean forward to see around them) but thats what protects their little heads.Although i did flip my kid around a little before 2, per the limits he could have been reversed until 3.5 (skinny-minny).I think the newer models have even higher limits.He is still rocking his Proride at 4 and loving it!I still recommend this seat, it is fabulous!This one has a lot of space without being big and bulky.I couldn't find it mentioned anywhere, but the bottom tray is detachable, which makes it easy to wash. Love that about it.I wanted something that didn't take up a ton of room on my counter.I do love that it can be made larger or smaller and is easy to do.I would put something on them and they would fall over (unless it was large enough to touch the bottom like a cup or something).Takes up little space and works perfectly!The shoulder straps are so uncomfortable and dug into my shoulders painfully with my 22 lb son in a back carry.It has the option of setting the fireflies and catepillar in motion or not, plus adding a choice of music or not, plus setting the volume level.I did not find the motion noise excessive.They should continue to enjoy the music choices, but the motion of the caterpillar and fireflies may be too tame as babies age to toddlers.Other than not predicting its longevity, I really like the quality of the toy, the music, the ease of attaching it to the crib, its appearance, and its value for infant play.If you want a good infant toy, this would fill the bill.Just no excuse for the lo-fi, highly compressed, hissing and garbled sound when in this day and age, you can easily fit higher quality recordings in the electronics.Generally I find the Fisher Price ones are good to very good (not sure if they make the Ocean Wonders aquarium anymore, but that thing was awesome!)http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-73545-Ocean-Wonders-Aquarium/dp/B00005YVRN/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1284650410&sr;=8-2We just received another soother as a baby shower present so I will post impressions of that as well (and compare with this Infantino model) once I set it up and check it out.Bottom line:  Sorry, can't recommend.This Infantino Firefly Soother did it's job well in my house.She loves pressing the button to change the scene.The device has music that you can play along with it that admittedly covers up some gear noise heard when the music is not playing.Nickie seems to love it!Babies just love these cribside company-keepers.I have a 5 month old baby girl, who we call "love bug" so this was to perfect for her room... and let's admit it, it's adorable!I knew she enjoyed watching it to help her fall asleep but it was making me crazed so it's been off for the past few days and I'm personally sleeping much better and she doesn't seem any less happy.My baby is captivated by the moving wings on the bugs.Some parents like mobiles and stuffed animals, etc.The straps on the back make it pretty easy to setup.It's nothing spectacular.I didn't like the nature setting with the cricket sounds.The first is that it has late night cricket noises.The moving frog, inch worm and firefly wings make sort of a humming noise that is useful if you have the sort of kids that like the sound of appliances running.This is the second bedtime soother we have owned.There is a setting for two different music, and one nature sound (very relaxing).The nightlight feature is very calming, constantly dimming and brightening in a nice soothing fashion.You can switch the soother to just music, lights, or music lights and motion (with the little wings of the firefly moving and the caterpillar walking).It's fine in all of the settings except motion; you can hear the gears grinding and moving and it's NOT at all relaxing.My son's Waterfall Soother is so quiet when it's in motion, so I know they make these to be a lot more "soothing."My 1 year old son does like it though, so it's got good kid appeal.This is our first experience with a crib soother.On a positive note, setup was extremely simple.However, the motion will not work independent of the other 2 features (sound/lights).There are two major drawbacks that I can see.We own two bedtime soothers.The lights seem to fascinate my 4 1/2 month old daughter.There are options for just lights, just sound, or you can combine lights, sounds, and motion.There is also a volume adjuster.My only complaint is that the sounds of the gears is quite loud when the motion option is on.He really loves all the colors & textures - I have a feeling this item will be in our family passed down for years to come.I bought these because I thought they were cute and I liked that they could stack on one another.When I stack them on each other, the weight of the one on top can sometimes topple the whole stack.Overall, these are the perfect size for traveling (when the lid doesn't come off) and they are cute.I give them 3 stars since the price is about right for what you get.So, they're great for at-home use, but would be horrid for travel.My son enjoyed these so much that he got his big sister into it too - she enjoys making them herself with her friends!I also give them to my nephew when he visits - which he loves because his is teething!Highly recommended for all ages!These are so great!They have a tidy, attractive, compact appearance that make them fun to use and easy to stack in the freezer.The serving sizes are huge for a baby just starting solids (like mine) but I think that they seem to be about equal to a jar of baby food.I did wash in the dishwasher, and put it on the top shelf.The container and top came out fine.I wanted to have silicone with a lid to keep food from sloshing around while it froze.This silicone mold worked perfectly and for a better price than the beaba system.Food pops out really easily if you run the bottom of the mold under a little warm water.The only thing that can be improved is the lid could fit better.So it clearly states colors may vary, but I REALLY wish it had the option of choosing boy or girl colors.It was for my son's stroller and I got a bright pink cup holder.I attached it to my Combi stroller.Holds a variety of size cups.The self-leveling feature works wonderfully - I had 2 full beverages and "popped a wheelie" to go over a curb and absolutely no spill!We love them!These wraps have two textures depending on which direction they are wrapped to provide optimal comfort.I do cloth diapering for my daughter and was looking for an easy way to carry around prewetted cloth wipes when we are one the go.This little pouch is the perfect solution.It holds about 6-8 cloth wipes (3x4 unfolded) folded in half easily.So far we haven't had any leaks and I can just throw it in the wash when I wash her diapers.I really love this mini bag.I will caution that it is a mini bag and I can only get it one to two inserts in it.It works perfectly for holding and containing any wetness or smells.I use these straps on two "lazy susan" cabinets.They prevent access by the little ones, but are easily opened by adults.I actually think these are the best, most secure locks available.The downside, of course, is that they are less than aesthetically pleasing.These are a must have for any parent looking for pants to fit right on their child.This is perfect.These are such a necessary item.I would suggest getting two or three.This is our fourth stroller, and our baby is only 9 months old.It's sturdy, rolls and steers very smoothly, is super lightweight, folds up really small and has a long carrying strap, is super cute (ours is lime green and black, so modern looking!), has a nice sturdy sunshade, and the handles are a great height for both my husband and I (6' and 5'7", respectively).I find the cons to be fairly minor and I hope to use it well into toddlerhood.I love this stroller!First of all, it comes in fun, non-gender specific colors, unlike so many baby items.Second, it is extremely lightweight and easy to unfold one-handed (even while holding a baby).Third, the proportions of the stroller are perfect!There are a lot of other great features, too.There is a carry strap that is great for transporting the stroller.The mesh seat keeps baby cool in the summer, and we purchased the "Volo accessory pack" which has a solid, padded seat liner which we use in the winter to keep baby warm.I love these they are perfect for cosleeping with our baby.they will see so much use, and worth the investment.I also love that there is no entrapment space with these unlike all the other bed rails I have seen.My daughter can easily get in and out of bed over the magic bumper and seems to enjoy squishing up against it at night.Granted it's just a foam wedge but it works really well and keeps the bed looking nice and neat.It stays solidly in place, has held up its shape and firmness, and keeps our daughter from rolling out of bed.It is a perfect height, she can climb over it to get in and out of bed but it's still tall enough and with an angle to prevent her from rolling over it.Let me start by saying these work really well - I wish I had found them sooner.We use a platform bed and most other bed rails and guards require a box spring set up.I ordered the four pack, which arrived much sooner than estimated.These bumpers are amazing!My 18 month old climbed out of her crib so we transitioned her to a twin bed.She loves it but wakes up in the middle of the night bumping her head on the wall or side rail.I wondered the same thing, and having owned this bag for over a week, I can say yes...for the most part.The bag I received (in black) had absolutely no flaws: the stitching was perfect, there were no scuffs anywhere, no tiny marks, the zipper was very smooth and well aligned.The faux leather can best be described as smooth and shiny.It does not have the heft of real leather, nor is it buttery soft.The strap drop (about 9.5") is comfortable, though I wish there was some grip to the underside of the dual shoulder straps.The longer strap comes with a removable pad which has a grip on the bottom.I found the pad to be obtrusive and uncomfortable/dorky, though, and don't use it.The front pocket is roomy enough for a small square wallet or your iPhone, plus it has a smaller zipper pocket for essentials you need to keep secure (it would fit cash and a few credit cards).The interior of the bag is jam packed with pockets: 3 small open pockets on one side, 2 larger open on the other (both large enough for a few diapers or wipes box), 3 small wall zipper pockets, and 1 large middle pocket.The large middle pocket is the most useful - it is a great place to "hide" diapers.The smaller 3 pockets are less useful - they aren't big enough for sippies, are too big for my cell, too small for my wallet, and aren't elasticized so not great for storage for bulky items like reusable grocery bags or spare socks.The larger two pockets on the other side fit diapers and wipes, but since the bag is short, it can be hard to close the zipper when you put size 6 diapers in the larger pockets.The three small zip pockets are OK but I wish there were two small zip and one large, deep zip pocket that ran the length of the wall of the purse.The pen loops seem loose - wish they were pen pockets instead, though, since my pens always fall out of them.I don't use the keyfob because it isn't detachable - I hate having to remove my keys from the attached purse fob whenever I want to start my car.The side bottle pocket is awesome.Is it worth the cost?Absolutely.I mostly bought it for when I go back to work.You have to keep in mind that those pockets do not close.They are good for quick access stuff.Inside the bag you have two smallish size zippered pockets which can be useful for more important stuff like a cell phone, keys, Nintendo DS.I'm pretty sure you could fit a Be Mine or even a Be Rich in those pockets.(I'll check when I'm at home and edit this review) There is a huge back pocket that you can either put a change pad or magazines.Yes the pocket can get funky but any pocket style bib will and you will need to replace the bib every few months, I usually replace every six months or so but considering I use it 3 times a day every day that's not so bad.I love this bib!It has different sizes around the neck and covers my son's whole chest and belly.The pocket is also great for catching food and spit up.and most importantly, keeps the kids toasty on those frigid days.they do not need coats when in there, a hat, long sleeves, sweats, and a blanket over their legs works just fine.We have the orange boon high chair so these are not a perfect match but since the straps have to be washed every few days it's nice to have a second set.I felt like by using this, I was taking one step backwards from the sippy cups that he was already using.In fact, with other sippy cups my 10 month old effectively takes sips.With the thinkbaby he sits there with his mouth attached for long periods of times just as if he was using a bottle.No good if your trying to transition to cups.I love the high back since she is still wobbly when she sits.My son loves this jumperoo.Normally, I would give something he loves five stars but there are some minor issues.We put a book underneath so that he would have the proper support; however, two days later he was able to touch the ground.My son actually turns on the seat but he doesn't go to that section because - well - there is not much there for him to do.I guess I could add some toys to the links but who has time to remove toys on and off the jumperoo and car seat?edited to add:My son is currently 9.5 months.We bought it when he was around 5 months.So, if I had to do it again, I wouldn't have bought the jumperoo, just more variety of small toys to put in his pack and play.I leave the four stars because it is a nice design and very entertaining for him.My son absolutely loves the turtle from the same series.First the stomach button does not work.The 4 paws work with individual instrument music but the stomach button (which should incorporate all 4 instruments into 1 melody) does not work.Also the music sounds shrill to me, not at all as nice as the turtle.So I would recommend the turtle, but would caution against the lion.I bought this toy for my 10 month old daughter and she loves it.It is perfect for her age.She can easily "pop" open the characters out of the top of the airplane by manipulating the knobs.She also loves to push it around on the floor  and hear its take off sound.It has a real life sound of an airplane taking off which my daughter loves to hear.I would highly recommend it.I didn't realize how quiet this toy was when I got it.Flipping the volume control switch doesn't really change the level.I received this toy as a gift for my son.If it weren't for the lights I don't think my son would be into it all that much.Those both are far superior.This doesn't have any suction power.Not worth the purchase.You cannot pick a color for this item which is very inconvenient.I received pink and I am having a boy.I'll be returning the item, what a hastle.I received this set today and while I was happy we didn't get pink (having a little boy) the packaging was destroyed.I am sure they will not take this back as a return because there is no way i can even see what the quality is without opening it completely.These hooded towels are super-soft and a great price.I am very happy with them, and bought another pack for a friend's baby.I got my order very fast.I bought this to pack lunch/snacks in for daycare.And unlike the Innobaby Packin Smart, which I had purchased earlier, these screw together so there are no leaks.Because of the price, I'm not gonna buy a ton of these, so I wash and reuse the same one each night, and washing piece after piece, night after night, I've just really come to hate that raised bump on the bottom.Like I said, other than that, it's pretty great, but I continue to search for a stackable snacks container that's just that, a snack container.My twins love it!great purchase.I wouldn't expect Jeep to make them any narrower because they need to be used around all sorts of straps, so just a heads up that they are pretty wide but everything else about them is perfect.Simple and Soft.However, she gets frustrated when she tries to suck or chew on them because they are a bit chunky.The second seat (not included with this model), popped in easily as well.I was a bit surprised at how high the main seat is ...Since I had recently had stitches, and the Mom sharing it with me had a C-section, my husband opened the box and brought the pieces inside for us to assemble.Even assembled, it is not lightweight, nor easily carried, so if you are looking for something to "grab and run" from the car, or something you can use for easier airport travel, you might want to consider having a lighter version - Britax makes a nice sturdy umbrella strollerBritax Blink Compact-Fold Stroller - Modern Flower.All-in-all, this is a VERY nice stroller, but you will likely want to consider the needs of the parent and child before purchasing it.Like many of us, I have gone through my fair-share of strollers over the past 7 years and multiple children.I have never, however, gotten a travel system, let alone one so gorgeous.Not a reason to get it, by any means, just trying to put into context how nice it looks.Ok, now some pros and cons:PROS: Nice and huge underneath storage which is accessible from the back or three zippered access points (front and both sides), so even when you switch the seat direction (which takes no extra equipment or strength) you can still get your essentials plus.The sunshade provides a full 135 degrees of coverage (the only one I have found better is the City Mini at 180 degrees) and has cool magnetic connectors sewn into the fabric to firmly hold the viewer window flap.Also, the all mesh window allows for good air circulation versus a plastic shield.Additionally, each of the velcro holding points for all the covers holds perfectly and firmly and have never required and readjustment.The ride is very smooth thanks to large but not oversized wheels and is nicely assisted by two simple side shocks that are built into the frame and don't interfer or stand out.I also appreciate the adjustability of the seat belt, specifically for my toddler, since she likes to sit up and lean forward - I can simply put the waist straps on (the shoulder straps are separate and can be tucked away).The stroller turns easily with a great turning radius and even with double seats installed all manuoevers can still be done with one hand.Both seats have easy (one handed) and smooth recline/incline adjustabilty into three different positions.Otherwise, the single is perfect for up to 50 lbs, the second up to 35 lbs.CONS: 1) After just a week, the silver color already shows stains.Although she does eat in it, it's never anything too messy, so I'm surprised that the fabric already looks stained.2) the removable parent console fits nicely into designated holder slots at the bottom of the stroller, but there is not a great place to relocate it to the top.And, when positioned at the bottom it is not easily accesible for the parent while walking.Also if you do relocate this parent console to the top, you can't recline the seat fully 3) it is a little wider than some of the other strollers I have had in the past.A really great stroller overall.This is a full sized travel system type stroller that has so many options it's almost dizzying but Britax has designed it so beautifully that everything is super easy to use and figure out.(I am 5ft, my husband is 6ft and we can both comfortably push this stroller.- Huge storage compartment underneath.Plus it has zippered flaps on the side and front of the storage basket so that you can access your things without having to dig everything out if you have it stuffed full....genius!- Child's shoulder straps easily adjust by sliding a little dial on the back of the seat.- Front wheels can either swivel or be locked into place with the flip of a switch and...Presto!My 30lb 3 year old fits comfortably into either one.)- It is absolutley Beautiful!It takes up a large amount of space in the back of my three row Chrysler Pacifica.Hint: Lock the wheels before folding it up.Overall, this is a fantastic stroller.This stroller is feature-packed, well made, and very comfortable.Instead I'm writing my thoughts based on several months of use and 7 years of stroller ownership.Even though it's not sold as an off-road stroller the addition of a set of stroller shocks would make this my perfect stroller.When I'm at the park following my other kids and don't have to leave the paved path to walk on grass the ride becomes very bumpy.My baby always sleeps well through stroller rides even if they are a little rough but this stroller is heavy enough to create an extremely bumpy ride off pavement that always wakes him up.Another weight-related complaint is how hard this stroller is to grab and carry when folded.This would be unimportant with a lightweight stroller but this one is heavy enough to need two good places to grab it and I haven't yet found a comfortable way to do that.It looks like it's possible for it to catch on its own, as all of my other strollers have done, but I can't get it to latch.Maybe ours is just a dud.Last, the shoulder and lap harness straps won't stay attached to each other.They are made to slide apart which is a great feature that means my child doesn't have to contort his arms to get them into the straps, but when I am latching them into the buckle at the waist I have to hold the two pieces aligned perfectly together with one hand in order to get them into the center buckle.But overall I love using this stroller when I know I won't be off-road and know that we will be using this stroller a lot.I have had MANY strollers over the past 11 years.I am tall and have always gotten back aches from having to bend and push other strollers.The 14 different configurations works wonderfully with the different age children I care for.It is also very easy to fold, and un- fold.The large wheels make it very easy to maneuver around anything that comes my way.The 5 point harness is great for all ages of children.All other double strollers I have tried are either to wide and can't fit in places or are to long and the child in the front seat gets kicked by the child in the rear seat.The positioning of the rear seat in the Britax B-Ready is lower so both children have plenty of leg room and can ride comfortably.The insulated bottle holder is a great addition.I am really looking forward to purchasing the additional rear infant seat adapter and the children's cup holders.I give this stroller a 5 out of 5, and would highly recommend it to anyone who has children!!B-Ready had smooth plastic feel to them.I can see that they would get all scratched up easily.The center was had a grip that was molded for one-handed steering.(just to add an another stroller, the Baby Jogger City Select has really easy folding capability!).It's better to just remove the seat.MAIN SEAT - Vista wins.Vista has 0 degree seat position and B-Ready did not.Vista 2010 added this to address a common complaint.B-Ready is slightly on the decline.(previous Vista 2009 owners found the kid pulling themselves forward to get upright).SECOND SEAT (REAR) - B-Ready wins .Vista had one position.More for a child chilling out and may nit be the best if kid is sleeping.The Vista seat was also closer to the front seat and B- Ready has more room for child in rear.Also, note that the B-Ready second seat is in the rear of parent behind main seat  FORWARD FACING whereas, Vista is in FRONT of main seat REAR FACING.I believe that's why the B-Ready can recline safely.B-Ready is accessible on all sides.With the rear seat, this is important.Most notably are: B-Ready has ability to use two infant carriers at the same time.B-Ready can use the bassinet with the second seat.So far, its been great!Very nice, easy ride.My complaint is the unfolding part.I think we'll need more practice at doing this.Unfortunatly with leather bucket seats it is really hard to manuever the thicker latch mechanism into place between the back and bottom of the seat of our car.Overall a great carseat and I think we got a great deal!I was easy to install and fits nicely in my RAV4.I have it rear facing and can slide the seat all the way back.My 20lb, 9 month old fits nicely and seems comfy.The latch clips are really easy to install.It feels and looks VERY sturdy and has much larger, deeper side protection.INSTALLATIONJust like the Marathon 65, installing using the LATCH system is very quick and easy with the seatbelt-type push button latches in the seat and the clip on the back of the seat.That's just great engineering finding a solution to a common car seat annoyance.With the side protection deeper, it is a much more ergonomic for sleeping, not to mention protecting the head from crashes better.Just like the Marathon 65, but unlike the lower-end car seats, each time you take the baby out and put the baby in, you manually adjust the tension of the seat belt with a pull of a tightening strap.This is a tremendous convenience and safety feature.CONSOn the Marathon 65, the book was attached to the seat.The quality and ease of use of their seats puts them above their competition.The first notable difference is the Marathon 70 is a larger seat.The harness adjustor strap's release mechanism works differently.The ease of use for this function is on par with the simple adjustment of the back on a  Graco TurboBooster.Parents who travel frequently and find themselves lugging their child seat through airports will appreciate the added touch of an area to clip the versa tether strap to be used as a carry handle.Installation of this seat was a snap.I installed it both rear and forward facing in my Toyota Sienna and it was easily and securely installed in both positions.Because the seat is so large, it is possible that this seat may not fit well in smaller cars when used in the rear facing position.Overall, this is a great quality seat that will keep your little one safe, comfortable and secure for many years.In the nearly nine years that I've been using Britax seats, I have found each of them to be worth the price.It is larger, but it now fits children up to 70 lbs forward facing (and 5-40 rear facing) and still fits easily in our Honda Odyssey and forward facing in our small VW Golf.I sat both of our children in it and found the difference to be slight, if any, over the old model, so if you are in the market for a new seat for child outgrowing the shell, this is probably not the best choice.The legendary Britax quality continues with a solid, intuitive build.The new harness adjuster is amazing, making it so simple and easy to change the height of the straps.We often carpool and I'm glad I can quickly and easily customize the seat to every child.Britax seats are always soft and comfortable for riders, so much so that my children notice the difference when they ride in other seats!Britax is an industry leader in safety and innovation, and I am glad my girls (at 4.5 and 6) are still riding safely in 5 point harnesses and protected by their Britax seats in the event of a crash.I recently bought a Britax Frontier 85 and was SO excited about the seat.My son is 10 months old and is outgrowing his Graco infant seat.I didn't realize however that the seat is only good for children at least 2 years old.So with MUCH regret I had to return the Frontier!I ordered the Britax Marathon 70 and absolutely love it (as much as I did the Frontier 85).It is so nicely cushioned and yet spacious enough.My son's back is not curved in anyway and his head is not pushed forward at all.He looks so comfortable, I want to be him in this seat!I love that I will be able to rear-face my son for longer and then forward-face him when he's ready.The crotch strap is GREAT!Moving it is a breeze -- just slide it over (nothing to disassemble).It has 2 position, but the furthest one is pretty far (8 inches from the back of the seat).The harness straps are so easy and FAST to adjust!!!The recline is a REAL recline (3 positions).Oh, and the steel frame is excellent (versus a heavy-duty plastic).I had been researching convertible seats for several months before deciding on the Britax.Comfortable (the padding is nice and plush).2.Easy to install using the LATCH system (I haven't tried installing it with seat belts yet).3.Easy to adjust harness and headrest (no more rethreading the straps).4.Overall, the Marathon is a great convertible seat that will last you for a couple of years.Solidly built.Easy to install with Latch system.The one-hand height adjustment is a great perk.I hope to use this seat for years!This is our second Boulevard and we love them both.That is all that is important to me...that my child is as safe as possible.My son has never indicated any discomfort or issue with the seat and he has even gone on pretty long road trips.You can't put a price on safety, so I feel this seat is a great value.We bought this item after a good experience with the britax chaperone.our son is on the large size and at 10 months of age, he has overgrown the chaperone infant carrier.This item has a very good cushion, easy to install, but is bulky.We own a toyota rav4 2010 and it is difficult for my wife (petite size) to put the baby in and out of the seat.She fits perfectly in this car seat.I love the upgrades.It's a sleek new seat with great safety upgrades.We chose this seat based on CR reviews, Baby Bargains reviews and the fact that it was easy to adjust the straps, both for tightness and height.Our son seems very comfortable in the seat and naps in it with no issues.We have a 2010 Toyota Rav-4, but still think that the seat is overly large.They did include velcro on the straps and seat to try to help with this issue, but it is basically useless.- I don't know if it is due to the overall size of the seat or if it is just a bane of rear-facing seats, but it is awkward to get our son in and out of the seat in the rear-facing position.Even at 10 months, he HATES getting into and out-of the seat, though he is fine once he is in and buckled.Again, this could be the case with any seat, but after spending 20 minutes trying to scrape out spit-up, I keep a bib in the car to put on my son immediately.All that being said, I am fairly happy with the seat and since our son is quite tall (almost 34 inches at 10 months), we needed a bigger seat to accommodate keeping him rear facing as long as possible, so this was probably our best bet.We are extremely pleased with this car seat for our tall 2 year old daughter.It is easy to install, not too big and feels very sturdy and well made.The silver birch fabric is super nice.It seems to be a "tougher" fabric that will stand up to everyday wear and tear better.We purchased this as a transition car seat and I know it will do the job.I originally bought the Saftey First Air Protect when my 9 month old outgrew her infant car seat about a month ago.I ended up returning the Air Protect for the following reasons:1) It did not fit well in the rear-facing position in the back middle seat in our 2005 Nissan Pathfinder.It was also very difficult to tighten properly even when I kneeled on the seat and yanked with all my might.2) the straps were CONSTANTLY getting twisted.*# straps.She just did not seem to be entirely comfortable in it.When I received the Advocate CS and opened the (smashed) box, my heart sank because it is a huge seat and I did not think it would fit any better than the Air Protect.Fortunately, I was wrong and the Advocate installed very easily and with plenty of room to spare.I was able to tighten the seat VERY tightly, I think due to having tightening straps on both sides.(I did have to use a towel underneath to make the base level which was also the case with the Air Protect).The straps have yet to twist and my daughter's head rests in a comfortable position.It has all of the best safety features with little extras (belly pad, recline lever, easy-remove seat cover, etc) that make it an easy seat to use and own.I am very happy with this seat and am relieved that the stress of trying to find the perfect car seat for our daughter is over.Our infant is about to outgrow his Chicco KeyFit30 seat and I read and researched about all the available convertible-type seats and ended up selecting the Britax Advocate 70 CS.We bought the Cowmooflage design which is whimsical and the fabric is soft and comfortable to the touch.The features like the belly pad, the additional cushions/chest pads, chest clip, etc.to help ensure a snug and comfortable fit for my child were clever and practical.We love the velcro on either side of the seat that holds the straps in place so that you can put your child in the seat easily.The height adjusting mechanism is a brilliant idea and a great time saver.Also, you can easily remove the seat cover for washing, without having to uninstall the seat itself!I was skeptical that it will not live up to all the hype, but so far, the item has not only met but has exceeded our expectations... We would buy this again in a heartbeat!My son is about to out grown his infant seat and I researched more than a few car seats.I have a small Toyota Yaris 2 door hatchback and always wondered about his safety.First off this seat is very big, well concidering my size car but it fits perfectly.Secondly, my Yaris has anchors and has made this seat super easy to install.Great quality and easy to use.This diaper backpack is pretty impressive given its price.The back straps are padded and has built-in stroller clips.This is a fantastic toy and a great price.My 5 month old twins love it.Great for teething, lights up, easy to press button, and plays 3 songs.No off button, just plays when pressed.It would be really great if they all rattled, but it's still worth buying.We love this simple and colorful toy.The pages are made from silky, brightly colored fabric that has numbers on one side and photo-realisitic pictures and words on the other, including a dog, cat and sailboat.The front page is crinkly which is a bonus.Great price too.I have had his sippy cup for 2 weeks now and just now checked the reviews on here and I don't understand the first review.....Anyways I was ready to transition my 10 month old son from bottles to sippy cups.My son is also able to hold this cup well due to the design.My son loves to throw everything, so I am glad that this sippy cup is spill-proof!The spout has no extra pieces and is very easy to take off the top to clean and replace.This sippy cup also fits perfectly in my chicco stroller cup holders.Overall, I am (and my son) are very pleased with this sippy cup.However I ordered this and was pleased.It's nice to have an aspirator you can wash in the dishwasher.It's also really nice that it is so easy to control the amount of suction.I expect it to work really well.For example, the bulb part is genius (it really is impossible to "suck" any stuff past it.It definitely seems worth getting.Besides, you can control the suction, so you don't feel like you are going to suck her brains out in the process.But when it comes to your baby breathing clearly...trust me, you'll do anything to make her comfortable.We received one of these and two of the Munchkin (3 compartment dispensers).There was more room in the seat again, and the seat belt wasn't as tight when I was taking her in and out.I guess she didn't like it after all, and it obviously wasn't comfortable for her.I don't know how this company claims it's for babies up to 1 year of age.And she is small, weighing 10-25th percentile.I wish I had bought it when my daughter was younger, I would have gotten more use out of it.I really love the miracle blanket much more than this one.It's nice because it's easy, but for some reason, it just doesn't seem as great as the miracle blanket.They are more rigid than other bags I've used, which I love, and the easy pour spout is ingenious.It's so simple, yet the way it helps you and the baby is unbelievable.I'm a grandma taking care of an 8 month old baby girl and this item has come as heaven sent for all the family.I LOVE the blueberry pocket diaper, but the cover is not my favorite.They show EVERYTHING, but I got over it because it's a baby thing.They work beautifully and make my little one very happy.These sucking pads are a little pricey (could make them myself for much less),but they are worth it!My son can gnaw to his heart's content and I don't have to wash the entire carrier.They also catch spit-up and drool quite well.They suck up the drrol and keep my babys face from the rough material of the carrierThe music is cute and the volume is just right.It's also light-weight and I can bring it with us on car rides and other trips.It also clamps nicely on the co-sleeper.The Joovy highchair is sleek, portable and oh so very stylish!I bought the black faux-leather version and I love this product.Pros:Wide tray with a cup holder and tray-cover that snaps off easily and can be pitched into the dishwasher!Fold-down, compact portability- You can take this highchair to grandma's or out to eat!5 Point safety harness to wrangle and secure the wiggiliest of baby bumsTray swings out offering easy in, easy out accesibilityFaux-Leather Seat is super easy to clean and can be easily taken off for more thorough cleaningsSet up is a snap and a click, literally!I love these bags so much though, I'm now looking at some of the others like Be Prepared in crazy fun colors.Their accessories are great too!This way you don't have to carry a separate change kit and purse.Everything can be organized in one great bag!I think its worth going through labor just to get this bag!The only con with this bag so far is that it is not really great as a backpack... sort of pulls out from your back at the top, but if you really need to be hands free for a second, its still a great feature.The bottles are different than the ones I originally owned.Now I have to turn on the lights or go to a lit room to see, but still, the quality is overall so much better, I am very happy, especially for the price.It was fairly easy to assemble.The finish seems to mark easily.The item we received was slightly damaged.A piece of trim, normally stapled on, had come off.Also beware of dragging the dresser along light colored carpet as it will mark the carpet.Otherwise spend the money on something of higher quality.The GoCrib is fantastic!!The baby sleeps beautifully in it!!Lightweight, but sturdy.You can move it all over easily when set up.What we love most?It's compact and lightweight so it fits right in the overhead bin.If you are looking for an awesome travel crib solution this is what you want.It is easy to get the crib back into the back pack.Overall I highly recommend it.We did my son in cloth diapers from birth through potty training - prefolds and covers, mostly pull on pants.Cheap and effective.Also waiting on some Flips...What I LOVE about these - It couldn't be easier.Every one complains about the velcro not holding up.The microsuade liners come pristine white each time and do not pill - they look amazing after several washes.They fit both girls - one is 29 pounds, one is 35-36.Fuzzibuns one size are trimmer and maybe more fancy looking but do not fit my bigger girl and are tight on my smaller girl, whereas these on the biggest setting are comfortable on my bigger girl and on the second biggest fine on my smaller girl.If you REALLY want a one size that will take you to potty training, these are better than fuzzibuns.I suspect Fuzzibuns will be nicer/trimmer on a small baby, though.I am really hoping to have my girls trained by the time #4 arrives but I could have 3 in diapers for a while and these will take some of the sting out of that.Basically, love love love these diapers.Cons:PRICEY - never would have splurged like this before, but I figure I'm only doing this once more, I want to experience it all.So for naps, or long trips out - depending on what changing capabilities will be like - If I can't change every 2 hours - I am sometimes more comfortable using prefolds.So they say.The SMELL...  look around and you will see complaints of SMELLS on these dipes.a sin in the natural world - which I have tried - and it seems to help.I am searching for the perfect way to combat the smell, something in between "natural but doesn't work" and "never do that, you'll wreck your BGs!"but the smell is not a big enough deal to not love these dipes.I don't see myself going 100% pocket dipes but I see myself reaching for these a lot.Trying to figure out the ideal number to have.I really, really love them and wish I had gotten into them sooner.Baby #4 is going to have some awesome diapers.(I don't realistically see myself going right in to these at birth though - newborn prefolds and prowraps covers are cheap and simple and IMO the best way to go with a newborn who poops a lot...  will likely start these around 2 months or so - can't wait!)We've been using cloth diapers for about a year and Bumgenius are still our favorites.The new 4.0s have improved velcro closures and are a bit larger than the 3.0s, so hopefully they will last longer.I bought this for mobility and chose this particular one for the physical support it offers me and baby.I'm 5'2" and this is Fairly comfortable to wear, easy for me to put on myself with the backstrap all the way at top.I borrowed the infant insert from someone else so maybe this has been addressed but the strap on the insert doesn't stay taut enough.I must admit that it takes practice getting baby in there (which does the Bjorn too)..and it looks very difficult to use it any other way than in the front.Unfortunately, baby can't face forward..but, they get used to it.The Ergo also seems to be much hotter than the Bjorn..but, I prefer to be hot than have an aching back.The waist strap is about 5" longer than the original so no need for waist extensions as with the original (this was my main reason for returning the original).It is comfortable for me and my little one.She sits happily bouncing along inside.I have a Snugli and Baby Bjorn...both of which are great for when your little one is small.This one does have the sleeping hood and pockets but not able to have attachments like the Ergo Sport Model.We bought this hoping to carry our 7 month old son.The straps aren't straight, they're angled.Well, when I opened it up, I realized that wasn't going to happen.great item.give kids usually warm drinks during cold times and it stays warm.The product description here on Amazon does not state this, but the stroller I received is the new and improved 2011 model which was just released in October 2010.The new strollers will have a large blue sticker on the box stating that it is a 2011 model.Previous model years of the Baby Jogger City Mini had a "slouchy" seat, that many people described as hammock-like for the child sitting in it.It seems very comfortable for my 6 month old baby.If you have an older model of the stroller, you can purchase a PE board directly from the Baby Jogger company for approximately $10 or $15.It slides into the seat back, and you can not see it once it is installed.Another improvement in the 2011 model is the addition of velcro straps that enable you to make the seat slightly more upright if you choose to do so.When attached, they pull the seat back about 2 inches forward which enables the child to sit up straighter.The straps are a bit of a pain to fasten, and you have to detach them before folding the stroller.I really like the features of this stroller.With the Maclaren Quest that I previously owned, a small diaper bag made it tip over.On the back of the seat, there is a large mesh pocket that runs almost the full length of the seat.We recently took a 9 day cruise with our baby, and brought the stroller along.The large sunshade in the tropical sun was invaluable.The easy fold/unfold came in especially handy with getting on and off trolleys, tour buses, water taxis, etc.:)I also purchased theBaby Jogger Adjustable Belly Barto attach to the front of the stroller.I also attach small toys to the bar using these simple toy straps,Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Black/White.I thought these stroller links would attach 2 umbrella strollers so I could have a light and small stroller option in my car trunk (I have twins and double strollers are big and bulky).The links attached the strollers in three places.Is it nice?I really like this feature because although there is only one receiver, it constantly recharges when you put it back in its stand so you can take it with you anywhere.2) The talk-back feature.I also like that I can hear them upstairs entertaining the baby when I am downstairs in the kitchen cooking dinner.Cons:1) I really only have one, but for me it's a big one: it simply takes too long to figure out how to set up all the features I want.If you are gifted this at a baby shower and this is your firsts child, say 'thank you" and be happy you have it.And set it up before the baby arrives!The nightlight provides a nice soft glow.That makes it nice if I am breastfeeding and need my husband to bring me something.It is nice, however, to know the humidity level.The sound and picture are great, and there is no interference like we had with Summer.Both day and night video feeds are very clear, and the design is clean and modern.There are some nice features like night lights on the baby unit, and the ability to have baby unit start playing lullabies by pressing a button on the parent unit.The camera is not fixed to the camera stand, but held by a magnet, so it can be easily adjusted in any direction, and it can be used without the AC adapter with AAA batteries.The night vision infrared lights on the baby unit glow red.For example, we have absolutely no problems with the interference with this Philips Avent Baby Monitor even though my wireless (b/g) router is located in the same room as the parent unit.However, we did have some interference issues with the Summer baby monitor although baby and parent units were located in the same spots where Philips is now.At the same time, Summer baby monitor worked without any interference when we took the parent unit to the kitchen.Maybe the assumption is that most parents only want to hear when their child cries out loud, rather than the deep sighs or moving around.I had my husband go into my son's room, and move around the room to see if the handheld would pick up that noise and turn on.However, if you are comfortabe with this feature, I would say that the picture quality is excellent.You can see and hear the baby, without disturbing their light slumber.This is an excellent device for new moms that like to check in on their little angels without disturbing bedtime.The remote access and digital image make convenience a priority with this baby monitor.And the camera with a magnetized base is great for silent swiveling.My one complaint is that it took some time to get the ranges correct.Overall, it is convenient and stylish with some extra perks, too.Recommended.The AVENT digital monitor is nicely designed, has excellent video quality, and many extra features not found on other baby monitors.The video picture is displayed in color during the day and black and white at night or when the room is dark.It works from greater distances, but the detail, and IR at night suffers.-Other electronics, any really, weaken the signal and operating distance greatly.-The audio monitor portion is barely functional at best.Yes, this was after all other electronic devices and interference was eliminated.I live in a relatively small apartment.We just have too much fun.Once I kept finding him out of bed quietly playing.I knew he was coming over today, so I set up the system.I am not very technical, but this was quite easy.This unit is ball-shaped and attaches to its base magnetically, so it is easy to position, but shouldn't move easily.This unit plugs in, or can run off non-rechargeable AAA batteries.We were able to observe that he rolls around and takes his time getting up after he awakens.My other daughter has 15-month-old twins who talk to each other when put in their beds.I think we will try this one out on them to see if we can position it to view both of them.It looks like a pretty wide angle.Do I have any complaints?When you see them get out of bed you could push a button and tell them to get back in bed.It does play music when a button is pushed on the parental unit.I don't need that feature with my current grandchildren, but another is coming in the spring, so we may get to use that feature then.I am impressed with the technology.For small living spaces, like an apartment, this might be extremely useful for additional layer of home security.The handheld device is also just the right size.It isn't too big or small, and yet, it feels solid in your hands.No interference with WiFi networks and cell phones: We have a large WiFi network with 4 wireless routers, and we live in a dense neighborhood where there are several WiFi networks within range.The range may be farther still -- I haven't tested the full range yet.4.Simple setup: Plug it in and turn it on.Night vision: Doesn't light up the room and is surprisingly good.It has a bit of that security camera, black and white look to the video, but it's perfectly good to see baby in low-light conditions.NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT:1.Size: In the age of iPhones and the like, the parent video monitor seems like an oddly large unit.But quality wise I doubt this monitor can be beat.Solid technology.An hour or so off the plug and it would be flickering off.So rather than starting over, I bought a 2nd one (actually my third one since I had to buy a whole new system when the battery on the first went out).The new unit has some quality issues such as not picking up the baby crying and the power button needed to be wiggled to work on the unit.The one which I received was thePhilips AVENT DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature and Humidity Sensors, SCD530, White / Blue, the 530 model.This model includes the temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, AND lullabies.You can select a favorite, or you can play them all, depending on what is most soothing for your child.Sometimes it only takes a sentence to calm down a fussy child, and knowing Mom (or in my case Grandma) is near, helps to soothe a fussy little one.Since Amazon leaves off the model number, I'm not 100% sure which monitor they are selling here.The monitor I received was the Avent SCD530 which is the newer model.The one pictured is the SCD520.That aside, I am very pleased with this monitor.Avent seems to have improved this in the newer model.My son's bedroom is upstairs and I find I use it as kind of an intercom.I love this!This is probably my favorite feature of the whole thing.Reception is great.This is the first monitor I used where the receiver can easily slip into a pocket with room to spare.It's thicker than an iPod Classic, but shorter and not as wide.You have to pair/sync (whatever you want to call it) the receiver to the transmitter - simple as turning them on in a specific order - first the transmitter, then the pager.Pediatricians agree that BOTH room temp and humidity are important, especially when seasons change.No problem.Other features: The receiver (marked "parent") has a belt clip, rechargeable batteries (included), speaker (to listen in) and mic.The quality is really impressive - the receiver looks like it can take some real abuse.Both the base and receiver have back-lit LCD's, and the base also has an amber night-light.The included carrying case makes transporting everything easy, so you can take it on vacation, etc.I also tried analogue monitors, however, these did not work either.Looking at the description and photo of this item, it looked a little large and I had wondered if it would fit anywhere in the baby's room.When it arrived, it was much smaller than I had imagined.Pros:1.8 Ghz Technology (works great with no interference)Price (Costs more than the unreliable cheapies, but alot less than a comparable digital monitor)Size (fits well in the nursery)Rechargeable battery is the parent's unit (less disposable battery consumption)Wall plug in the infant's unit along with optional battery back up (4-AA)Infant unit will function without wall plug if you are unable to plug it in for some reasonEco-Mode saves battery lifeAdjustable sound sensitivity (it makes me feel better if I can hear him moving around)Intercom Feature (if I am in taking care of baby and request that someone listening to the monitor bring me something, they can let me know that they heard me, also they can offer assistance to me if the baby is crying for more than a minute or two)Temperature Gauge allows for me to monitor the baby's room's temperature while he is sleeping and go in and adjust it if needed so he doesn't wake up too hot or too cold.Cons:No video feature (This is not a deal breaker for me and I am not particularly impressed with any video monitors at the moment, however it would be a nice feature to have.I am not lost without it though)The conclusion is that I love this monitor and hope that it will continue to function well as time goes on.I had my son in it within 15 minutes of opening the package.I'm 5'5" with a small frame and didn't want something super bulky.-Will fit a newborn without having to buy any extra inserts.I am happy to know that I can use this when the next baby comes along, though.-The buckles have double locks on them and require two hands for release-Feels VERY secureMy only complaint about the Gemini is that the extra fabric from the straps hangs down quite a bit.That's really a minor complaint and wouldn't keep me from buying another one!The only thing I wish were different is the color: It's off white, not pure white, and doesn't look it's best when the rest of your outlets and the electrical sockets/screws are all white.Small price to pay for safety though - Overall I'm very happy.It is a brown color but it is very dark, almost bark.You undo the back buckle and adjust it to fit secure/snug and this creates a `pocket' for the baby in the front.You then place the baby in the pocket area with the legs to the sides.I have not used the hood yet but it is easy to access in the front of the carrier with one hand.It is to protect the baby from the elements outside.The straps are more for back use and I have used this carrier only for front use.I have others that I have bought but have not used them since this is the one I always grab.The front carry was not terribly comfortable -- which I find is often true with larger/older babies in just about any carrier -- so I put her on my back.(For the record, I am 5'10" and have a fairly long torso, so this may not be a problem for shorter women.My goddaughter is a very large baby, but she's quite strong (sitting, crawling, trying to stand), and I felt like she was just sort of slumping back into the fabric and wasn't properly supported.After a few minutes, she started to fuss, and I took her out.However, no one in the room thought she -looked- particularly comfortable or well-supported.So ...* You can have baby facing in on the front or behind you.* Straps are padded and feel secure.Cons:* There are no places for extra diapers, money, keys, etc.Some other baby carriers include this, and that's nice for when you're taking baby out hiking and don't want to be toting along a diaper bag or backpack (plus, with the baby carrier, there really is no where to carry the other items if you are solo).I also needed someone to help remove the child from the back position.* Baby can't be carried face-out in front, which is sometimes nice for the child, so they can see what's coming up.I like the facing out position best because then you can point things out.* If you are small in stature but have a large (tall) child, I think that the forward facing position may not be possible, as it seems like the baby would be right in front of your face.I say that, although I'm 5'8", the positioning felt a little high up.Overall, I found this a comfortable, easy-to-use carrier.It's stylish, durable and for the most part comfortable.My youngest is too small for this (it is designed for kids 15lbs and up), but I tested this out with the son of a friend of ours and it works beautifully.The kid seemed comfortable.It looks great and is very easy to use, and I love the fact that you can use it front and back because as the baby grows carrying them piggy-back is ideal (I also love the foot-straps!).You won't be happy about it.I just can't say enough about how comforting it is to use this and know that the baby is secure and comfortable.When we take our kids youth group class out for field trips, all the littlest babies come as well.I use this to carry some of the youngest ones.It would be terrible to trip and lose my grip with a little one in my arms, but with this, they are safe and secure and give me full use of my hands (which also helps keep baby secure).The straps can be adjusted to a full rang of sizes, so both men and women can use it.Spend a little time adjusting them to find what works best to make it comfortable for you as well.The foot stirrups for the baby are adorable and extremely useful.They keep the baby's legs from dangling at an uncomfortable angle and help keep proper circulation to their legs.There is ample padding for the parents in the waist and the shoulder straps.I find I only use the front carrying position for the littlest babies.Sturdy, easy to use, and comfortable (or, as comfortable as anything that straps your kid - or, in my case, nephew - to you can be), this is a very good product.The color and texture are nice, and I've had no problems with it so far.If you're in the market for a baby carrier, I can recommend this one with confidence.This is a good looking, functional and comfortable baby carrier.The straps are comfortable, it's easy to adjust.Also it has a little extra height to it which helps keep it very close and stable--very helpful and better for your body/back.The "Glacier" two-tone color combo is also very stylish.I have three small children and have been babywearing [my infants-3 years olds] for almost 5 years.Comfortable & very comparable to the beloved Ergo2.I think the back feature is much more comfortable than the Ergo7.Straps are padded nicely9.A little uncomfortable under the armpits if not properly adjusted while wearing on back2.I don't have kids, but I'm at that age where everyone around me seems to have them.My daughter is 20 pounds and it is very easy to carry her on the front, and she loves the snuggly secure feeling and becomes relaxed when I put her into it.I got a Baby Bjorn when my first daughter was born but didn't use it much.My daughter loves to see what is going on so putting her on my front, facing me does not work - she just squirms and twists her neck trying to get a better look at the world around her.So I thought that maybe having her on my back would be better but unfortunately it was not.She rated the Boba as one of the best.It's easy to use, very comfortable, and reasonbly flexible.I think it's definately a good choice for anything other than a really small baby.Tried using a Moby wrap, a Mei Tai style one, and now the Boba Classic.It's not like a lot of the popular wraps right now in which you have large pieces of fabric and must arrange them around your body in order to support the child, but instead closer to something like a Baby Bjorn.The manufacturer calls this a SSC (for Soft Structured Carrier)The carrier offers two main positions, back and front.The first time can be a bit daunting, getting all the straps setup for you, but after that it should just be as easy to slip on.I've used the Boba for a 1 year old and a 2 year old.It was much more comfortable than the Baby Bjorn with this size child since you can use both front or back carry.The 2 year old didn't work well being carried in front.The back carry is better for older kids.The 1 year old did great with the front carry and it was very comfortable for both of us.If you don't have much experience with soft carriers, I would recommend trying many first before deciding which one fits you best.Overall, I really like this carrier and will be using it on short walks in the neighborhood, but will keep the stroller available for those longer walks.While she technically can still be carried in the Baby Bjorn Active carrier we have, it's not very comfortable for me to carry her for long periods of time.It's super easy to use.For the back carry (facing your back) it works the same way, but in reverse.Because I do find that you often wear the bottom belt closer to your hips, the extra length is nice for larger individuals.The one disadvantage is that it'd be nice if it had a forward facing carry position.But that's a small disadvantage given all the great features - comfort, portability, and ease of use.It is quite easy to put the baby inside and out without help.It is comfortable to use.The straps are comfortable and the material is nice.No silly prints, just nice earthy colors.The Boba carrier is sturdy.I love that.Love that, too.It looks slick, probably better in real life.On the back, there are foot straps to help baby feel secure AND they can pull themselves up and work the legs, which you know  most babies LOVE to do.The booklets that it comes with does a play-by-play guide to putting it on, for front or back Try it once or twice with the guide and you're good to go.The hood is optional, but a nice touch for keeping baby warm and dry.PROS:Lightweight but sturdyRolls up fairly compactFoot strapsAttractiveNatural productVery useful.Comfortable for mom and baby, with smaller childrenSecure for baby (and mom, too!)Natural bonding vs stroller for carryingCONS:A little complex to put on the first couple of times.Not as comfortable as children get bigger.Can be hard on the back.I couldn't imagine walking down the beach collecting shells as I do with my Beco, heck I couldn't imagine vacuuming the floor.I'm hopeful it works better for me in the back carry position which I haven't tried yet as my baby is in a hair pulling stage right now.Why I like the Beco better: obviously as you can tell by what I've already written the main reason is that it's super comfortable for my build.I also really like the fabric options & colors.But as I have had other babies I have some experience with carriers so I won't be reviewing completely in the dark.Instantly, I liked the look of it.This one sizes very easily and will fit most normal sized people.it seems to snap on and off easily and rolls up nicely so I'll probably leave it attached and just not use it.I don't know if I will use the foot straps.I notice in a couple of previous reviews that people have mentioned it's not so comfortable with older, bigger kids-- but honestly, this is about as good as it gets.But if you have a strong back and a strong desire to keep using a carrier past the toddler stage, then this is the best carrier I've found for that purpose.Background: I'm an experienced "babywearer" and have owned about 10 types of carriers, from Moby Wraps to ring slings, pouches, and SSCs.My favorite to this point is my APLX, which I still favor for some reasons (I prefer the fabric choices, and I like the inner pocket to store the sleep hood).For newbies to babywearing, first of all, good for you for even being here and considering an alternative to the ubiquitous Baby Bjorn, which I thought was awesome for about a month, until I began learning about all the better alternatives out there.In the earliest months, I loved my Moby, which is basically just a long piece of stretchy fabric.My daughter hates being in a shopping cart and will stand up and lunge right out of one if she gets the opportunity, so it's safer to have her strapped right to me!I've always been more physically comfortable with front carries, even now, which I know is odd (usually, people prefer back carries for bigger babies and kids).Great baby carrier, soft fabric, easy to put on, comfortable.Good quality.Highly recommend.I reviewed this with the help of my 15 month old, 30-pound son.His size, and my size, probably made using the carrier less than optimal.As a front carrier, getting my child in was very easy.This resulted in pressure being applied by the un-cushioned part of the straps.The fabric for this carrier is nice and soft and seems to be pretty sturdy.That's fine if you have a child who never spits up or is incredibly tidy, but I prefer a carrier that can stand up to frequent washings.I found using the Boba as a front carrier to be uncomfortable.I have tried many different wraps and carriers and by far the Boba Classic is THE most comfortable and secure of them all.But IF i HAD to carry him in something the Boba carrier would be my choice.It's simply the strongest and most comfortable carrier I've ever used.I also love the variety of ways to adjust the carrier, so it truly fits any body shape.It's easy to use and put on and it also doesn't tangle up like some other carriers.Even though the "Twilight" color would not be my first choice, it's still such a beautifully constructed carrier that it's attractive in any color.This carrier basically has the baby straddle your stomach of back and the child is held in place by a heavy duty tight weave canvas that is held in place by a padded waist belt and two shoulder straps.It's really a nice setup.There isn't a once size fits all solution for everyone, or every baby.My first child would have hated this, but the second one loves it.If you have a friend and can borrow whatever carrier you are looking at I highly recommend that approach.I'd say this is a good one; it seems well constructed, and is as comfortable as anything I've tried.I used theBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Blackwith my son when he was smaller, and I can say my Boba is more comfortable even though he's heavier now (20 lbs).I haven't seen a need to wear my son on my back in this, and honestly the directions for getting him in carrier on my back seem intimidating to try on my own.First, here are two things about carriers in general:(1) You definitely need a carrier if you want your baby to excel in development, motor skills, emotional maturity, immunity, etc.Studies show that children who have more body-contact with parents are far healthier, learn faster, are more confident, etc.(Eh-hem ... Fathers, listen up!We use them daily - even around the house (cleaning, cooking, etc).No headrest (so only use when your baby can hold up her own head), and the seat is too wide for smaller bodies.-It's a bit bulky for travel.-Cost is a bit high.All that said, we're definitely keeping our Boba.However, it folds up nice when going from stroller to carrier.There are lots of other Snugli designs - some have lighter/breathable fabric, some are different colors, etc.They are versatile (baby lays down, sits upright, sits on side, etc).Amazon carries them (Maya Wrap) but you can find them for under $30, or make your own - it's very fun!For a novice, it takes about 15-20 minutes to stitch/construct with a basic sewing machine.Someone bought us a Maya, but later we made our own & love it much more.You can nurse standing up.Much more comfortable than it sounds.You can nurse standing up, and very comfortable for the baby.But all the weight is on your neck/back, and not as versatile.Scootababy Baby CarrierBaby Bjorn is definitely a Top 5 choice (along with Snugli Performance, Boba, & Maya).First, theErgo Baby Carrieris very well constructed, comfortable, distributes weight intelligently (on hips).Cheaper straps.Have fun traveling around with your baby, & introducing her to the world!I received this as a gift and I just love my Boba.I love my Boba and definitely recommend it!When I put the Baboa Baby Carrier through its paces recently I was pleasantly delighted at the design features which seemed to make up for the (very) few shortcomings I found in the other two models.But like everything else in life, perfection was elusive.These two have a clip that needs to be fastened in the back that is virtually impossible to manipulate solo unless you are a yoga veteran.As far as comfort on those all day Disney trips, both of them kept the pressure in all the right places on my frame to keep it from throwing out a disc or two.It's stylish, comes in several great color choices, is comfortable to wear and easy to use.Not only it looks sturdy, it also look beautiful.Rated up to 45 lbs or 20 kgs.It is easy to place the baby in front, no problem at all.It is easy to adjust as you only need to pull the end of the straps to tighten the hold.The tricky part is if you want to put the baby on your back.Start from a couch where he can be safe if he falls while trying to saddle him in.If you don't want it, you can take it off completely.Made in China.It has comfortable shoulder straps, is appealing in the design and look, and sturdy.It is also nursing friendly for the mothers that are going that route.The material seems strong and sturdy, and is pleasant to touch for the wearer, and I think the baby.The padded shoulder straps and waist strap are comfortable and supportive.It's simple, easy to use, and comfortable.I want to give it 5 stars in some areas and none in others.Pros:Baby is obviously very comfortable and loves it.It's made well.It reminds me of a backpack.It could fit a lot of different sized people.Cons:Just one but it's HUGE - My back kills me within minutes.I've never found one that was comfortable for both myself and either of my kids.After a while though she gets uncomfortable with the position of her hips and tries to adjust her posture which gets us both a bit tangled.(I'm about a size 8).It can hold up to 45lb according to the specs but I can imagine a child that size may be uncomfortable in it and that may be a lot of weight for the parent as well.It comes in an array of attractive color variations (I got the Dusk one which is a nice charcoal and graphite gray tone, very fashionable) made from quality brushed cotton.Very comfortable with padded straps and even weight spread I feel pretty confident recommending it for parents with neck injuries like myself if other carriers bothered you.I'm very pleased and would certainly recommend to my friends and family looking for a versatile carrier.Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.I haven't used this carrier on my back yet.PROS:* This carrier is well made with strong outer fabric and softer fabric against the babe.* The stiffer waist band, while more supportive, can chafe a little on my hips when walking long distances, especially if the clips from the footrests find their way to my hip bones.(I'm sensing a theme.)At first glance, the two carriers are almost identical to one another in features.*The Ergo has a nice little zippered pocket on the front that is great for putting small items in, such as a wallet, or a couple of diapers.I prefer the Boba in this regard.I'm not sure what the real reason is for the D-ring, but I use it to attach a pacifier strap.The Boba doesn't have this feature.Of course, this is a matter of personal preference.I've been using it for my 16 lb baby who is 5 1/2 month old, and it seems very comfortable and secure for her.But this Boba is in the style of a back pack we take on camping trips.She was carried in front on a hike we all took in the Georgia mountains.The Boba carrier is comfortable, and the adult is better supported as well.The buckle on the waist is heavy duty!Buckling the top back buckle myself seemed to be an impossible feat at first-and I practice yoga!However, it didn't take long to realize that the strap the buckle can be adjusted to go higher up the back, allowing me to buckle it myself.It is very comfortable to wear and baby seems to like it.Then after I buckle it, I tighten the straps to a perfect fit.I've loved having this carrier & would say it's worth every dollar!Second Update-BROKEN: It's now June 2013.She happily rides on my back in the Boba while I shop, but now I can't!Summary: Compares very favorably with the gold standard Ergobaby, addressing several of it's shortcomings.Better for larger kids but likely less suitable for infants.With 3 kids we tried every iteration of baby carriers.Although our youngest was almost 2 when we tried out the Boba, it was nice to see some competition.As much as we like the Ergo, it's not perfect.That said, we really didn't use the side carry position very often.The multiple possibilities of adjustment are great, and the padding is quite comfortable for both parent and Baby.Very tight, securte, and supportive.It's also quite attractive and functional.However, it's a little overwhelming to deal with.There's definitely a learning curve when it comes to the multiple straps, and I appreciate the tweaks and adjustments I can make, but wow!Still, if you want to be able to adjust to you down to the little detail, this is great.If you take the time to read the manual, however, and practice, it soon becomes second nature.The manual's clear, illustrated instructions quickly helped us get the baby in where he settled after only a little squirming.In the carrier, the baby's weight was well distributed across mommy's waist and there was hardly any discomfort--none of the straps bit in anywhere either into mommy or baby and baby's arms and legs and torso were comfortably cradled in close to the back.The Infantino Baby Balance Carrier is a superior product from what is quickly becoming in my estimation a superior company.Recommended.We have lots to say about carriers - but first, here are two general comments:(1) You *definitely* need a carrier if you want your baby to excel in development (motor skills, emotional maturity, immunity/health, etc).Studies show that children who have more body-contact with parents excel in every area.(This is especially important for other fathers - make sure to find a comfortable carrier that fits you well, so you can *enjoy* that bonding time!They are versatile (baby lays down, sits upright, sits on side, etc).Amazon sells them (Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Ring Sling-New 2010 Colors (Medium, Pool)) but you can find them for under $30, or make your own - it's very fun!Much more comfortable than it sounds.You can nurse standing up, great for dad, and very comfortable for the baby.It's padded and comfortable, light weight, somewhat versatile (baby faces in or out), and one of the easiest loading carriers.And I don't find it comfortable anyway:Balboa Baby Adjustable Sling by Dr. SearsFinally, the ErgoErgo Baby Carrieris very well constructed, comfortable, distributes weight intelligently (on hips).Have fun traveling around with your baby, & introducing him/her to the world!There is very little visibility for them so if you have a curious little one this may not be for her.Naturally, the bigger the child the heavier they tend to be so not so comfortable after a while.I recommend two for safe loading.This review is actually written by two different sets of parents as our son is now a little too big for the baby carrier, but had a chance to enjoy it for a while.Another reviewer said "probably not for babies more than 20 pounds" and I think that reviewer hit the nail on the head.The shared agreements, and perhaps this is a universal for all baby carriers which are strapped to one's body, is that it made us both a little nervous to use at first.Is the little guy uncomfortable because I put the straps on too tight?But when you get accustomed to it, it gets better.I tried to put my son on the "front of me" side one time.I wasn't comfortable with it at all, and I think my son is still having flashbacks with the experience.When he was on my back, it was much more comfortable for me (and I'm sure for him!), and he got a kick out of seeing the sights from that perspective.We were quite satisfied by the experience and recommend it, but know that there's nothing like the security of being able to see your child when you carry them!That's why I wish we'd gotten it when our son was younger.Now that we've passed it on, we're hearing some familiar sentiments.The young lady who owns it now is still getting used to the intracacies of strapping a five-month old into it and how difficult that can be at first.The young lady is not large like me, she's petite, and she feels that her daughter's legs are spread out too much when she has her infront of her.The straps are comfortable and even thought it was a little scary at first (read: this is me being over-cautious!)I'll start with the good:1) Very well made with high quality buckles, straps, padding, and nylon exterior.2) Super comfortable for our son.This ones is very suitable for even a 1 week old baby.The not so good:1) The back straps do not adjust enough for my size.Neither one feels good after a while!2) The back straps needs a cross-support for those with a wider back and shoulders.It feels like the straps are perched on my shoulder blades, and there is nothing to keep the closer to my neck which is more comfortable.She doesn't have any of the complaints that I do.However, this was intended for me to use to carry around baby, not her, and so I've had to go looking for other options.This really is a nice carrier--solid, well made, and comfortable for baby.I just wish it was comfortable for me!3/5 Stars.This carrier helps to carry the baby around the house.I still like the baby bjorn better, but this is rated to 35 pounds, which is great.Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.It feels very sturdy on due to the comfortable and sizable waist pad.- The padded strap runs a nice long length down the back (in front carry position), which makes the carrier very comfortable for mom.- There is a small pocket in front for carrying phone, keys, wallet.I was very surprised Infantino left that out.* It is way too small for my 34-lb, 3'3" son.* It holds the babe pretty close to the body, which some babies only like when sleepy.* The straps that come out of the side of the body of the carrier are held on with elastic bands, which in time will lose their elasticity.It works best with the larger sized infant.This is my second infantino baby carrier and pleased with both of them.What is unique about this is that it does not have a separate pocket in the carrier for the baby's legs.Most of the  baby carries have a separator inbetween, whereas in this, you just need to place your baby in the baby carrier and your baby is in close proximity with your body - which makes him/her feel warm and comfortable.Comfort for your baby : There are 3 touch points - one is your body which is warm, the other is the side of this carrier and most importantly the part where this touches the legs/thighs.My baby was pretty comfortable in this for almost 1 hour without any complaints so I am assuming that it must be very comfortable, also did not find any groove marks on my baby's thighs/legs after I took her out of the carrier.Comfort for you : The shoulders are well padded + the most important thing for you is to make sure that the waist strap is well fastened so that all the weight goes on to the weight, not to the shoulders.It's fairly tricky.The "seat" for the baby is really wide and even though it does have a tiny strap with a tiny velcro closure to gather the fabric, it still seemed like it would make the poor little one do the splits.And mine are about 25 lbs each, I don't see how it would work with a small baby.We tried the backpack position next, which was what I was more interested in anyway.When I put a little one behind me, the straps kept slipping off my shoulders because they were too wide and even though I think my kids were pretty secure (I had my husband keeping an eye on them back there), they just didn't FEEL secure.And I still had those long straps dangling everywhere.A few words about some other "features:" It comes with a mesh bag for "easy washing," but the bag is pretty small.It also has a reversible front panel.Plus, the whole carrier is so thick even without this extra piece of fabric that it's really hot.I didn't give it one star because it might work better for some people.It is understated, modern and stylish.I was disappointed with the ease of use and adjustment.If you're going to use this you should carve out some time when you're not in a hurry and practice with it.Ultimately this will not work for my life style.I need something that is easy on and easy off for the pace of my day.Just because this didn't work for me, doesn't mean it won't work for you.The Ecosash has to be tied and untied every time you use it.Pros:* Comfortable straps.* Can position baby on the front facing in; front, facing out; or rear* I found it easier to put baby in behind me than I have with other carriers* The straps allow more leeway in adult body size than carriers with straps and buckles* Comfortable even with the top of the weight range* Affordable priceCons:* If you are a smaller framed adult, the straps will be long, and you'll probably need to double-tie them around your body.In a super warm or humid climate, it might get uncomfortable for the baby.Neutral:* Front panel is reversible: the pattern can be turned around for a solid black.This was not a very appealing or interesting feature for me.I say that in the most loving way.Adorable patterned design2.Easy to wash & comes with washing bag9.I have a 6 month old, but I'm not sure I'd be brave enough to put my newborn [like suggested] in it...too risky for meBaby Bjorn Sport, Infantino standard, Evenflo, and this Infantino Ecosash.For twin usage, it didn't work either in the front of the back.To prevent the straps from slpping off my shoulders, I had to criss cross the sash straps like you would carry from the front.It prevented the straps from falling, but it was far from comortable having the straps positioned so.It's a mei tai ("may tie"), which is a very common and popular kind of baby carrier.it's super cheap- booklet that comes with it is somewhat informativeCons:- the method of tying is uncomfortable.It makes the carrier uncomfortable if the panels touch your skin or your baby's, and it's totally unnecessary, in my opinion.- very large and bulky for a small baby- no pocket!I am pretty petite in the ribcage and waist, so even with a big baby, I was able to tie it properly (see below) but not in a bow, only in a very unsafe double knot.A petite woman with a small baby MIGHT be able to tie it properly, but that's clearly not how it's meant to be tied.The instructions have you cross the straps over your shoulders and then bring them around under your arms and tie them there on the baby's back (if you are carrying baby on the front, facing in).I find this method of tying uncomfortable for me and the baby.I've almost always seen mei tais tied around the back, with the straps going under baby's legs for extra support.It is also stylish and neither masculine nor feminine.It is the perfect way to take your little one for a walk without a stroller.This would make a wonderful baby shower gift.Highest recommendations!These were fine.Whether or not your will like this type of carrier probably depends on your level of patience and if you have had any experience with these types of carriers before.For a first-time user it can be rather frustrating - it takes practice learning how to tie the straps and sit the baby snugly in the carrier - I highly recommend practicing with a doll before using a real infant.For a mom on-the-go like me who is always in a hurry, I think I prefer a carrier with buckles/belts and adjustable straps over this, but perhaps if I had more time to carry I would like this one better.While the detachable/reversible panel is a nice cosmetic feature it's not really necessary - I could easily do without if it would bring the price of the carrier down a bit more - and the price actually is quite good compared to some other sling-type carriers out there.I like the variety of ways that you can carry your child in this - front facing in, front facing out, on the side or on the back - just be prepared to practice tying and arranging the straps for each different way.This is easy to clean - just toss in the washer with the little bag that is provided, and the nice dark color will help conceal any stains that might happen.Overall I think this is a great sling-carrier for the price - I recommend trying a sling carrier from a friend or in the store if possible before purchasing if you've not tried them before.Also, you can carry a big kid in this - it may not be the best for them or you, but you can get the job done.Husband is 6' and around 170 lbs.* Fabric and quality are great.* I love the versatility.* There is a small strap to wrap around the bottom of the carrier in order to cinch it so baby's legs are more comfortable in the face-out position (not in a constant split).* May be more supportive for baby than a Bjorn since it holds them in a seated position.* And finally, I find it very comfortable.It is not a snap-and-go device, so takes a little more finesse, especially when trying to feed the straps through the loops.* While it's rated for 8-pound babes, you will need to strap that baby into you very tightly if you want to keep him somewhat upright.* It takes some work to get the right combination of tension and hight in order to maintain a nice long carry.* Also, I find that I have to re-tighten the wast strap several times during a long carry.I would definitely tell any mother to purchase this item.It's good quality and comfortable!All seem to have a their cons in either comfort, quality or price.So far this carrier seems to be a nice middle of the road line carrier with a stylish design.Amazon's return policy is also more than fair for this item so you risk little giving it a try.It is brightly colored and had different feels to different parts.My twins are not interested in this yet.We love these!We have a supply to use as wipes and a supply to use as washcloths.I still recommend these reusable wipes for anyone that is cloth diapering.I am hopeful that my new Advocate will have the cutouts otherwise the cup holder is worth what I paid for it...that is worthless.Before dropping one penny on this thing please check your seat for cutouts that should be under the fabric cover on the plastic beneath at the outer edge I would guess where your childs knees might be...if you don't have any cutouts then don't buy.Goofy mistep from what is normally a good company.I bought this cup holder for my britax boulevard CS and it does not work because there are no slots in the car seat for it.It is a simple, nice cup holder.I bought an ergo but he did not fit in it at the supposedly-ready 5 month mark -- his little legs were splayed too far apart.Great carrier, very comfortable.I also owned a babyhawk for about 3 days and while I adored the cute pattern on that, I didn't feel it was as safe with the buckles (Ergo tests the buckles to high standards, they just feel more "solid", and also the Ergo has reinforcement elastic bands just in case a buckle does ever fail it should "catch" on the elastic.)I just received this today so far so good!The picture is great!The sound is amazing.The screen is huge!LOVE IT ALL.Hopefully it continues to impress.I love it!Perfect size scoop to use with Charlie's soap.It is only the outer shell.The lining is a separate purchase that can be attached to it.We used the wearable blanket with swaddle feature with our twins.I bought these when they outgrew their swaddle-me.I think this for when they are under three months, in newborn size would be great.I bought this carrier after using a Moby wrap (which was very comfortable but tiresome to wrap on), a Baby Bjorn (easy to use but my shoulders hurt after my son hit 15 lbs) and an Infantino EcoSash (same concept as Pikkolo but not as comfy for my son).This is an awesome carrier: 4 available positions!Its forward facing position is very comfy though your child has to be comfortable to spread their legs apart some.My only con is the price.I would say $60 would be more fair.Though it is well made, it does not have pockets or any other such little features you'd love as a parent.I recommend this carrier for its 4 positions available for the child as they grow and the carrier's ease of use without the necessary assistance from a second adult.UPDATE: The hoodie buckles are too delicate.The cup holder is simple and not as bulky as others(munchkin and valcobaby).It fits on SQURE tubing, not round tubing.It will work for all maclaren models volo, triumph, quest, and techno XT.If maclaren XLR has the same rear tubing as other maclarens, then this cup holder will fit.I loved it!It is a godsend considering there are few choices out there for maclaren strollers, which do not have any cupholders.Love this bath.The platform is a nice touch as it raises the bath higher.we both love bath time with this bathUpdate - at 8 months we are still using this bath.The fact that it is elevated really helps my back.I bought this because none of the other bouncers seemed to 'cradle' a newborn.The little lamb bouncer is almost identical to this in appearance and comfort but does not bounce - it's stationary.This is the best of both worlds because it is very cozy for a new baby yet has the ability to actually bounce (you have to use your hand to make it bounce - it's not automatic).Also, while both the little lamb bouncer and this bouncer have a vibrate feature, the little lamb shuts off after 10 minutes.My daughter loves to be bounced on a yoga ball and it was killing my back and I can bounce this aggressively enough where it simulates me bouncing her on the ball.When I received it, it's 100% polyester, which is why I took two stars off.But I kept it because out of all the activity gyms out there, I think this is the one that is the least of an eyesore in my living room.Overall, I think when it comes to picking activity gyms, it's more the parent's preference than the baby's.Parents like to "overstimulate" their babies with the toys that light up and play music and it's really not necessary to keep a baby happy.my children call this night light "the little blue guy" and loved it's glow.that's right....loved, not love.it doesn't look like we can replace any parts.i went online to order something similar since my children were asking for it.if this is a new and improved version of the mobi tykelight then kudos to the company for fixing the short lifespan of this product.Amazon has recently been encouraging including packaging as part of user reviews, so here goes:  this one sucks.But when it came time for real world use, i.e.the bedroom, at bedtime, they asked me to turn it off!So if you want to turn this off (or more crucially) on, you will have to fumble around presumably in the dark, feeling for that tiny button.Another unit I have almost exactly like the Mobi (soft touch plastic shell, changes soothing colored light, pleasing shape), is activated/deactivated by just pushing on the unit's "head", which is akin to hitting a snooze button on an alarm clock.I will look up the name brand (didn't see one listed on Amazon) of the other VERY similar unit I have to this Tykelight and updated my review with that info, if you are stuck on this style of nightlight.Edit:  The other, HIGHLY recommended unit (cheaper by half, and much better) that I mentioned is not available on Amazon, so I won't link to it.But I will give you a hint:  swedish meatballs, cheap furniture, blue and yellow.The light around the base is a nice improvement too.This clever light is the perfect companion for her since it helps her get to sleep by slowly shutting off over a 15 minute period and comes instantly on if it is taken from it's base (like for late night visits to the potty or to our room).This is well made and intuitive to use, just plug in the base unit and set in the Glomate.The ability to change colors and the rainbow mode are nice additions that allow for some variety as well.The Glomate is perfectly sized for little ones to hold onto and hug, but it is made of plastic and not very flexible, so it hasn't replaced her stuffed animal has her "lovie" at night.Highly Recommended!CFHChecked that the power adapter was plugged in, yep, all good.Moved the figure slightly on the charging stand, nada.Ours generally stays on the rotating colors option, and it cycles consistently, even when on the charger.What's not to love about the GloMate Plus?It's kid-friendly and softly casts a light that you can use as a night light, to give a warm light as you try to find that binky in a darkened room and even to give you a soft, non-glaring light if you're on the road in a darkened aircraft cabin with your baby for example.The timer feature enables the GloMate to turn off after 15 minutes' use.Just be sure to read the directions or you won't know how to modify its operations--there's only one button underneath the device which controls all the modes.That said, once read, it's very easy to use.I know my son will be using his GloMate for years to come.Recommended.My 1 year old daughter absolutely adores the Moby Glomate.I think the extra money is worth it to get this version over the regular "one color" variety of the tykelights.The Mobi Tykelight Glomate Plus is a great item for kids who are afraid of the dark.My niece is 10 years old and she finds Mobi to be the perfect nighttime pal.Not sure what the deal is.A little sad I can't rely on the green glow fo the base ring anymore.Since the birth of our son last January, we've used a small monkey lamp as our night light.Plus it was plugged, so as our little became more mobile I had to place it strategically.Before trying this Mobi light we tried Cloud B Twilight Sea Turtle...this was a nice option except it's difficult to find a place that allows for maximum benefit.I like the portability AND durability of this light.The red option is the dimmest, but red feels creepy.I love the rainbow option though.That's the hypnotic part.You can tell by the light on the base whether it's charging/charged or not.I see lots of uses for this.For kids: You can take it off the base and use it as a travel light/buddy for kids.Kind of a cool safety light.The package also notes that this light would be good for night bathroom trips for you or a kid, night feedings or checking on baby - all without having to turn on a bright light and ruin your night vision.-has lots of different colored lights and also a rainbow function.-has a setting where you can take it off the base and set it to turn off after 15 minutes.Unlike an earlier model which would only do it in blue, this model will do it in any color.-mine has been on the rainbow function, off the charger, for about 4 hours now and is still going strong.It may not be suitable for younger kids.Since this is targeted as "kid-friendly", I was surprised at how easily it could be disassembled by a child.The charging base is also very compact.Recommended for kids 5+ (or older) as well as adults looking for a small rechargeable night lamp.All you do is just plop it down on the cradle, and it charges as well.Little button on the bottom has 5 color options, but the daughter loves the rainbow color.Great nightlight for your young one, or for an adult or senior as well!The color pattern is a nice blue by default and then has several other colors that you can select to stay on (or on for ~15min) and then another mode that gently sweeps through several colors.The baby also loves watching it change colors even in the middle of the day so it's really multi-use.Pros:Toddler proof (at least so far)Has a battery (internal-rechargeable) so it's portable for hours on endEasy to grip, charge and carry around.My 16 month old loves it.The fact that it detaches from the base is really awesome.The base charger is neat, too, with a light beam around the edge, and when you wiggle the GloMate the colors change (maybe it means something, I didn't read the instructions, it's pretty intuitive to understand and set-up).So far my family loves the GloMate and gives it 5 stars.We had it on rainbow effect in my son's room and it just looked so cool rotating through the colors in a nice flowing transition.From the moment you receive your package until you can see your little Mobi glowing is all of 2 minutes, if that!My 11 year old JUMPED at the chance to have this nifty color changing friend in his room!The Mobi Tykelight makes a great gift for anyone it would so appear!It is definitely kid friendly and easy to use.A touch and you can change his color...or maybe he is a she?I do know that I would have loved to have received this as a gift for any one of my kids over the years!Mobi is chunky and easy to hold.He is pretty awesome!The light is surprisingly bright.I think it will be useful for breast feeding but not wake up a sleeping partner in the bed.It has a rainbow function that takes a bit of finagling to work and I'm not impressed with the tiny button on the base to make it work.None of the parts are replaceable (they are sealed inside for safety), so hopefully this lasts a few years.The GloMate plus is an great light for children, especially young children, but it does have some drawbacks.First the good news: it has a smooth, rounded surface and structure (kind of Casper the Ghost look) so that even really young children of 2+ can hold and play with it.I would not give it to children younger than 18mos or children who are still in the oral stage.There is a small metal plate and switch button that should not go into the mouth or be licked on by really young children.And the packaging clearly states that this product is for ages 2 and up.The GloMate sits on a base with no plug or anything on the actual body, so it is easily accessible to children who can just lift it up and go.The base itself has an electric plug, and it has a lighted strip as well, making it very attractive and easy to see in the dark.These can be stationary or can shift from one to the other based on the settings.Finally, once the item is charged, the light does last for a long time.This does not work as well as I would like.The color patterns seem to come on randomly and I could never tell what color I would get.The GloMate is a hard body, but smooth and comfortable to hold, but NOT soft.The packaging says it cycles "through the rainbow".The base glows red when charging, green when fully charged.We have 3 of the Guardian lights and have given about 5 of these to friends/relatives as gifts.Oxo Good Grips Candela Guardian LightThe details are very thoughtful (hard plastic leaf that acts as a teether, tiny mirror, lots of crinkly plastic) and make this a really great improvement on the usual soft books that are out there.We have been using this chair the last 6 months for my now year-old son.Here is all that has broken or that I'm not pleased with:* Tray's finish is peeling badly all over and no, I don't scrub it, I use a gentle, natural cleaner on it.* Hardware on sides does not hold the tray firmly in place; it slides out easily.I called the company, they were to send replacement hardware and never did.I love love love this highchair!My friends have different cloth seat versions and complain constantly about keeping the seat clean.I just wipe down and I'm done.Assembly was quick and easy.My son is now 8 months old and loves being in his highchair.It's pretty colorful, and certainly has fun toys, but doesn't cross that line into sickeningly cute.It packs up easily for trips away from home.You can put favorites in strategic places to allow your baby to see / reach them easily.The boppy is also a nice touch, and keeps our son comfortable while he enjoys the toys.The dimensions are large enough to accommodate him for quite a while though.For the price, this seems like a good fit, especially if like me, you don't like things that are overly cute!I also have a "Baby Einstein" model that folds via four foam supports, and the Boppy is noticeably higher quality.I love the Boppy Flying Circus floor gym.The colors are cute.Toys are adorable and a large size too.It's a 36"x36" floor mat with an attachable arch that lights and plays music.Love it, love it, this is the best one I've seen.It is the perfect type of activity mat for that age!The idea is great and the mini boppy pillow is a great idea.I lay him on his tummy over the mini boppy and could never walk away, because minutes later he is face down on the floor having slid right off of it.I bought a Boppy for breastfeeding with my first son.I still have it--it's held up very well... and to a lot of abuse.(Has music, lights, etc.)He's just started grabbing things in the past month, so it was nice to see that these are all really age-appropriate.After propping him up, and a bit of cuddling, he was happy to go back down on the mat for a few more minutes.I can definitely see this becoming a daily event.So, if for some reason your baby hates it... and nothing helps... relax.Chances are everything will be just fine.:)  So, honestly--do you need this?I'll also say that the key is the size of the boppy.The adult-sized boppy is just too big, but this is perfect.The large tray is easy to put on and remove; the included toy is a nice extra which can be used to entertain your little one while you are preparing his/her meal.My grandson's first birthday cake was shaped like a bee and iced with black and bright yellow frosting.The black frosting wiped off the piping easily and did not stain it.The two drawbacks to this chair are minor.Instead, we took an inexpensive bath towel and created a pocket which fit over the chair's back.We then let the rest of the towel fall down the back, between the harness straps, and onto the seat.This kept our little one from getting hot and sweaty while eating and was easy to remove and wash.We have used two - the highest height and we recently moved it down so that our son can eat at the table with us without the tray.It fits the bill.As I mentioned, the tray is dish-washable.We used this extensively when our daughter first started solids but didn't have the ability to grasp small pieces to feed herself.It was nice to allow her to feed herself and try new things without constantly picking up little pieces of food from the floor or worrying about her choking.Only downsides- we didn't use it for very long- probably only 2 months, so the extra mesh bags I purchased were never used.Also, I don't think the little water reservoir they claim can be refrigerated to keep items cold actually does anything.Bottom line- very useful for that brief period after starting solids and before a pincer grip.The picture sure looks good.You'll probably only want this for newborns on strollers/car seats.take note of the velcro.We dont use it in the carseat but we use it in his mamaroo & when he was a newborn we used it in the swing & bouncy seats for extra cuddly softness.My son LOVES the soft and plush feeling of this insert.Great price too!My twins use one of these every single day!I take it to every room my twins are in because there is always something I will use it for!Bought this for my new baby... and it works like a charm, but if you also plan on using the JJ Cole bundleme... it gets a bit bulky on the inside, so you may want to consider that if you are gonna use both.On it's own though, its fantastic....so many choices!After studying amazon.com, I saw 12 different companies under "washable nursing pads" at the start of this project.I hope my research helps you make the best choice for your needs.So far, each brand's strengths were as follows:>Kushies (3star)absorbed moisture immediately so they were the best inner doublers,>La Leche League (3star)appearance was best for use in B/C nursing bras,>Medela (2star) was easy to find in stores and absorption improved with time,>NuAngel (4star)was very affordable.Organic?, Made in USA/Canada?, Fair Trade?, Construction Material?2-second squirt of 3ml absorbed in same 2 seconds.Still fresh white color after 2 months use.Variable speed of absorption.13-40 seconds to absorb 3ml--improved after 2 months use.Excellent outer doubler.95% Cotton/5% Polyester, outer shell 100% cotton, seamless deep contour, 4 pads/pk.MEDELA:Single layer/light 3 starInner doubler 3 starOuter doubler 2 starheavy night solo 1 starRate of absorption 2 star: (3ml in 23 sec), 3ml within 5-10 seconds after couple months of useShirt test - back of pad damp in 20 minutes, not visible on shirt (3ml)Appearance 3 starAbsorbed 3ml in 23sec, absorption improved thereafter following additional months of use.White & patterns absorb more quickly than natural tone (3ml in 24sec), absorption improved thereafter following additional month of use.Probably best to use white alone or as inner doubler depending on anticipated flow, and natural tone as outer or alone if only slowly dripping.May work especially well for smaller sizes like A or B.I'm still hopeful that the other 2/3 of these brands can provide a more efficient answer.This review goes into more detail at [...]Just a word of caution for others purchasing due to the eco-friendly label, make sure you double check that it meets your needs.Not only is this diaper absorbent and trim fitting, it is so easy to use!Kissaluvs has made the diaper so that the insert is attached, no stuffing every.This diaper is amazing!The Marvels All-In-Ones have been a godsend!Turning the diaper right side out is as simple as a tug and this Marvel is good to go!Great contrasting colors, good absorbency, and the fastest change possible make these my diaper bag staple.I bought this sterilizer when my Avent sterilizer stopped working.I recommend it highly.It works well with many different brands.These are great for the winter months.It's also great that I don't have to remove them to change her.Love these!I love this diaper!The inside is so soft against my daughter's skin, it's SUPER absorbent and fits really well, she can even wear jeans over this diaper, lol.I love natural fibers for diapering my daughter and the hemp in this diaper rocks!I highly recommend this diaper!My son has an 18" or 19" waist and already needs it on the largest setting.Depending on what you need and what you're looking for in a diaper, this could be a dream or twenty bucks down the drain.See if you can borrow one from someone because it comes delivered in a hermetically sealed plastic pouch so you can't try it on or look at it without ripping the bag open which means no returns if you don't like it.I bought 2 but thankfully only opened one.I had been wanting to try side snaps, and I really wanted a RED diaper for my son!This one fit the bill.I love the inside being so very soft also!I prepped it by washing three times, and then I put it on my son.I would like to try it at nighttime to see how good it REALLY is, but I will have to get a little braver before trying that.This is an absolutely adorable bath toy set.And it's durable in the sense that the pieces are very sturdy.The mount allows for banisters that are square or round.Still the brackets were not a perfect fit on one of our banister so we had to use a "square" mount on a round spot to make it work; in the end it is very secure anyways.My one year old loves to stand at the top of the stairs and shake the gate; it is very secure!The kit really works well.Could not believe how nice and high-quality these bibs were when we received them!What a deal!They are thick, two-layered (terry is on back, knit is on front along with adorable appliques and embroidery.)Great value!This was part of a baby shower gift, given to me with a baby tub.I don't want to give my daughter medicine unless I absolutely have to so I figured I would try the amber necklace thing before resorting to anything else.I almost can't believe how well this is working!We have had it for 4 days and the last 3 full days have been free of any teething discomfort.I am also happy that I searched for rounded beads instead of the chips as they've got to be much more comfortable.I also really like the screw closure that is easy to use, even with a wiggly baby.I also love the light color of this necklace.The toys weren't electronic, but they were fun and simple.Anyhow after much research I got this one.It bounces well.The arc above the exersaucer doesn't serve much purpose either - the apples light up, the glow worm bum glows (but who can see it at day light).It is portable only in a sense that you can put it in the trunk in one piece.The electronic toys are attached with the two clips (unlike other brands that use velcro).but no cup holder.The bounce is good, almost equal to jumparoos.My favorite nursing pad!They are much more accurate than underarm or in the ear, although the gold standard is a rectal temperature, which can be upsetting to children.I actually wrote my Master's research paper on these thermometers, and here are a few tips in order to use them accurately:1. run the thermometer from forehead (above the eye) all the way into the hairline.It is always important to take the HIGHEST as it is most accurate.There is a chance it didn't read right on the artery so it wouldn't be as high, which is why it is best to do 3 readings.4.If your child is sweaty, the sweat dries off quickly and cools their skin temperature, so it isn't as accurate!Run the thermometer side to side, and not up and down.If you follow all of these steps, this thermometer is quick, easy and very accurate.I highly recommend it over any other form of temperature taking for young children.I own this thermometer, and in the past few years have purchased at least 6 more to give as gifts to friends who had babies.My advice is to read the instructions well, since the unit needs to scan around the forehead and then behind the year.I love it!This thermometer is great and I would recommend it.You do need to have the right angle to get an accurate reading.I typically take 3-4 readings to determine the correct temperature.Also, someone else mentioned this, but a backlight would be HUGE.We've used it on every member of the family!We could not take our sons temperature orally because he kept throwing up.The pediatrician also suggested that we do not take the temperature rectally because we had to give him suppositories to control his fever since he was unable to hold down tylenol or motrin orally.She actually let us borrow the professional version of the exergen thermometer to monitor his temperature.As soon as we got home I ordered this model and it arrived in 2 days.We always struggled to take our sons temperature orally or rectally.This thermometor takes seconds to record a temp.So simple and easy when you child is wiggling all over the place!It is well-sewn and sturdy.I rated it four stars instead of five because while I like that it is compact, it will not be big enough for when my now 8-week-old baby is a toddler.We love it.This is such a cute changing pad.Great price too!THE QUICK TAKE:  The Safety 1st Ultrasonic 360 Humidifier is well designed, quiet and compact, and one of the best choices if you want an ultrasonic humidifier for a small to medium sized room, particularly for a child's room.COMPACT:  This humidifier has a round base 7.5" in diameter, with the water tank above the base.It's a far more space-efficient design than most other humidifiers, and won't make you re-arrange your room to accomodate it like many other humidifiers do.This model is particularly good for a child's room, where you want a small ultrasonic cool mist humidifier.(Warm mist is too dangerous, and evaporative cool mist models have noisy fans.)The controls seem easy to use.(Though it would be nice if they could be pointed up a little more than they are.(Even a smallish humidifier can be too much if it has only one or two settings for the flow of humidity, as many do.You can also limit the flow to what will evaporate before it lands on the floor.There's no real flow of water vapor when it's turned to the minimum, but it's still a little unusual that it doesn't switch off - you need to use the switch in the back to turn it off.- Also odd is that there's no marking on the knob to distinguish which side of the ridge on the knob is pointing at the level on the dial.- The trim along the base of the unit is a light hue of a slightly bright green.(See the photo gallery.)That works for us, but I have to wonder why they didn't use a neutral color.This humidifier has no demineralization feature, so all the minerals in the water will go into the air, and often create a white dust - so it's not a good choice in a hard-water area unless you're willing to use distilled water.(See the photo gallery for a photo I've uploaded.)On the pro side, they are quiet, quick to put vapor into the air, and take very little energy to do that.On the con side, the process of the water evaporating into the air takes heat out of the air.That may be ideal in Arizona, but if you're heating the room it does offset some of the efficiency.(That's not a reason not to use them, just something that it helps to be aware of - it surprises some people.)There are models available that reduce bacteria, though they are several times the price of this one.If you don't want to clean the humidifier regularly, and the humidifier won't be somewhere that children might reach it or where it might be tipped over, then you may be better off with a warm mist humidifier (which boils the water, so that bacteria and minerals don't go into the air).One day I found him almost climbing on top of the oven door, which thankfully was off.I'm really happy with it and it's taking one more worry away from me.We have heated our oven to more than 350 degrees and it still stuck nicely.But, I'd rather have toasty hands that burnt toddler fingers.I bought a 2nd one and planned on using it for my dishwasher, but found that my counter is not laminated on the underside.I have some laminate material that I may try to stick on the underside of the counter to see if that does the trick.Overall, this has been a great purchase and I would highly recommend it.Whoever invented this I hope is filthy rich and sitting on a beach in Tahiti and sipping on some 40 year old rum.This Dekor pail and it's refills are so easy to use and VERY effective in combating any smell.It was soooo big there was no way to make it work.Then i thought well this size is so big the small should work perfect!The small ended up being way to small and medium way to big.This would be a great product IF they had more options for sizes instead of small, meduim & large.Because clearly ONE size doesnt fit all....not even close!This cover is great for all strollers & actually does the job.I LOVE how my daughter is protected from the sun, both on her skin & in her eyes.The shade is tough to attach to the Quinny Buzz, especially when rear facing.The velcro straps can go on the frame of the stroller, but you have to take it off when you want to close up the stroller.Also, the back part of the viser has nothing to attach to when the you have the seat facing you.Once you turn it around, everything is better... except now you are catching wind (even the little bit created from walking forward) and the flimsy shade bends back.Not a great purchase... but there aren't many options out there.easy to put on your stroller, and litterally blocks all the sun out, which is great because my son loves to sit foward and look at everything!There are also side pockets, which work great for a bottle water, or kids snacks.It can be easily put on any type of stroller; I use it with the travel system and the Jeep jogger.You can adjust the length of the strings, so your baby can have additional coverage,You can easily fold the sunshade and put it in the storage basket when you do not need it.It comes with 2 side pockets that I never used.I am using this shade on Maclaren Volo and it works great!!See the photo I provided..This playyard is perfect for our 7 month old.We have the basic model and 2 extensions.Looks colorful and nice, not like "doggy gates", I will use it later as a playhouse-safe area:) for her.When my son started to crawl I understood I couldn't do anything but just looking after him.As a housewife I also need to cook and keep the house clean and I got absolutely nobody to help me.So we had to buy the playzone.First time we brought it home our son loved it: it was something new for him, activity panel is also quite entertaining.My hub calls it "baby jail".Too sarcastic but that's the only place to which I can trust, and know that the baby will be safe in it when I need to do something about the house.There is one con I'd like to mention: activity panel can't be turned off, and when the baby pushes colorful buttons the music starts to play (which is also pretty loud).So the baby has more space to play and exploreMy 6-month old son has absolutely no interest in these which makes me very sad because they were NOT CHEAP.I really like these straps!Also, they are 2-ply in their construction, which also helps in terms of not allowing the mess to soak through easily, which was a life-saver on many occasions.I absolutely love them!Wonderful for kids with special needs too.
