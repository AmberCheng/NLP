I really like these and so do my kids.They like to roll them around as well as nesting them.The only thing that could be improved is for there to be 5 cars.4 is just kind of a random number to teach a young child to count to.Clever toy that has been a winner with my son since he was one.I plan on buying this for my daughter who is now 3 months even though she is not teething yet, she loves putting things in her mouth.I have two of these teethers and both see variable use as my little guy goes through teething spurts.In between, he actually likes sitting or kneeling on the star to get it to vibrate.But as soon as his gums start hurting, he goes straight for this toy.Also, it's a smart packaging extra to have the 'free ring' on top which clearly doubles for hanging purposes.All told, Baby Bungalow did offer it for the best price, including shipping.While the sheet is a perfect fit, I was perplexed by the 'button' holes on the under side of each corner.Can't imagine what those are for.That or my Co-Sleeper is on the older side and there have been design changes since.Overall, quality product.There is one serious design flaw though - the pail is tapered such that the bottom is noticeably larger than the top (probably for balancing purposes).The problem is if the diaper bag gets too full it makes it really hard to pull out the diapers.Pros:- cheaper than alternatives- worked great the first 6 months- was able to use normal garbage bagsCons:- smells after 6 months- bad tapered design makes it hard to remove diapersIt just has problems fitting around the big 4 corner crib rails so I am forced to attach the snaps on the regular rails instead which makes the sheet not be able to stretch to look completely flat.Today I just found another use out of it though after feeling that it was a waste to buy this.So I improvised and used this crib sheet to cover the top rail, it fit perfectly in length and snaps perfectly together to stay on.He usually only teethes on 1 side too!I thoroughly enjoy this product.It covers the full top surface of the crib, give or take an inch.My daughter has used 3 of these over the last 3 months.I have not yet had any problems with her getting underneath it.At 3am, I love not having to wrestle with the crib mattress.The snaps make it a breeze to change, I'm so glad I don't have to take the mattress out of the crib all the time!The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the snaps don't fit exactly around my crib rungs so it's a little wrinkled and off center, but my baby doesn't seem to mind.My son spit up in his sleep for the first 6 months, so this product was wonderful.However, by the time that he was 6 months old, all of my ultimate crib sheets had developed holes and cracks in the plastic backs.The product was such a life saver that I will purchase new ones (maybe a different brand) for future children, but I really expected more than 6 months of use out of these.This product was pitched to me as a "must have" by all my mommy friends.It has been good for us in terms of middle of the night accidents (so we don't have to put a whole new crib sheet on), but there is one major issue with it.There are always loose straps hanging off or awkward folds in it when we try to strap it down.We tried over and over again to get it right, but to no avail.We do not believe this is an issue with our crib as it is a brand new, high quality one.We finally gave up the idea of strapping the Ultimate Crib Sheet down and now just put it under the regular crib sheet.This is ok, but then when we do have a late night accident and have to pull off the top sheet we always worry about the Ultimate Sheet not being strapped down properly.It's a good idea, but needs to be redesigned to fit current crib railings.I wouldn't purchase this product again or recommend it to a friend.I actually have a very tough time getting into this.And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only.I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through (the surge protector and chest freezer cord).I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily.When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover.Recommend this just for thin plugs, no adapters.Good buy for the price.Nothing special...it does the job of covering what it is suppose to.Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well.It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening.In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover.If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child.And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there.This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip.But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks.This powerstrip cover is pointless.Any child can get their hand in it and get shocked.I do not reccomend this product at all!It did not stick well, and my 11 mo old daughter popped it off the first time she pulled on the oven door!I really like the fact that they can be unlocked for long periods of time, so when I am working in the kitchen I can leave them unlocked and then quickly lock them again.They are really not hard to install, I watched a video on You Tube that showed how to install them and then went and did it.I am going to recommend these to people I know.The nipple on this thing is HUGE and pretty hard so I don't think it would work for most babies because it would gag them and they probably just wouldn't like it.I've tried to use this thing many different times and my girls always spit it right out, even if I tried to hold it there they would push it out with their tongue, they HATE it.I recommend the Vicks Rectal Thermometer for that.I think companies make products like the pacifier thermometer because as new parents it sounds like a good idea but in reality, they just don't work and I'm sure your Dr will tell you the same thing.Initially, I thought this was a great toy.Unfortunately, at 6 months, she can now sit up, but has little control over her body.Today, she flailed herself towards the cube and banged her eye socket against one of the corners.She has no injury to her actual eye, but she has a bruise below her eye now, and has been crying all night.I am done with hard plastic.I think I am switching to all soft toys and cubes until she is 1.We liked everything about it...except that it was TOO LOUD!I've actually been amazed at the number of baby toys that are annoyingly loud.Some to the point that they made our babies cry (like this one).I've actually had to place duct tape over speaker holes on numerous things such as mobiles, play gyms, and an activity table because otherwise those products are great, just loud.But therein lies the problem with this toy - there is no obvious speaker hole on it.It's as if the annoyingly loud music emanates from every crevice.Which is why it has been put away since Christmas.Now that the boys are 9.5 months I may try to bring it out again and see if they will tolerate it.If not I'll just sell this overpriced piece of plastic at my MOMs Resale next month.He is very fussy baby but when I played the music on this cube, he loved it.The best sounds he liked were the flute, piano and the Orchestra.The Best thing about this Music cube is that you can play one instrument at a time and then the final orchestra one to kind of show the music-mix.I believe it will help develop my baby's musical skills.Cons: The battery didn't last long.We used it for 30 days, for about 10 min each day and the battery died down!But as he got older, he learned how to play with it more.He is now almost 18 months and he knows which songs he likes over other ones.I love that he loves this toy!My daughter LOVES this toy.We first gave it to her at 6 months for Christmas, which was too early.Around 8 months or so, she started liking it.The more she figures out how it works, the more the likes it.At 11 months, she plays with it all the time.Now she's strong enough to lift it, so she hands it to us to play.My niece had it before, so I knew it was a must-have with my little guy already.:)  SO key, even for those of us who appreciate the value and fun of noisy kiddo toys... there is still a time/place for quiet.Great, fun toy.I love this toy for babies.I love the bouncy ball style corners to keep baby from injuring himself.However, I not only have a baby, but two toddlers.This is a heavy toy.It hurts (a lot) when thrown by toddlers.It also seems to attract use as a step stool since it is a cube & has resulted in quite a few falls.Take this toy away when they are toddlers!And if you have both a baby and a toddler, don't let either play with this toy!It just doesn't make for a very good combination.This seems like a great toy for the musically inclined baby, my 5 month old likes looking at the flashing lights and trying to eat it the music doesn't seem too loud to me or out of tune,  perhaps that is a defect for the previous reviewer?However I do agree it is a great book shelf toy too.Now that he's 5 months old, he's still very interested in it.Currently likes to kick the buttons with his feet and loves the music (as do I).This is a toy that will provide entertainment for months to come!He liked mouthing the somewhat soft corners and I played it for him.He now plays it himself (13 months).I do not think he gets he can turn off and on each instrument but I suppose that will come.That is pretty neat.Baby likes it.The only problem is that there is no volume control.Batteries last a pretty long time in it.It seems really tough.It has withstood some hard knocks.The corners are rounded and slightly rubbery.It's kind of heavy so just now has baby really been able to haul it around.I always read reviews on this website and the Babies R Us site before buying a product.This product got great reviews so I bought it - I was not disappointed.I bought this for my son when he was about 4 months old.The music and flashing lights immediately captured his attention and, as he grew, he played with it more and more.I keep it in his playpen and it's easily his favorite toy (besides his exersaucer and jumperoo).It keeps him entertained longer than other toys.I like that it's easily washable and has soft rubber-like corners (so, if baby falls on it, no sharp or hard corners to scratch himself on).I also think the music is nice - nothing too annoying like a lot of toys out there.And, with the click of the "Orchestra" side, the song changes.So glad I bought this!Update 6/10: My son will be 12 months old this weekend and he STILL loves his Mozart Cube!If your kid is like mine, however, and likes to sit on the potty "unproductively" you might want to consider something a little more comfortable.The plastic frame that the cushion sits on has a rim around the inside.While your child is sitting, the fairly cheaply made cushion settles down and your child's butt is now resting on the edge of the hard plastic.Our daughter would always get up and complain about her butt hurting.Depending on what kind of toilet seat you have, it also has a tendency to slip around.I had to put some non-skid pads on the bottom so that it wouldn't fall into the toilet with a toddler's wiggling around.My daughter is having some hard time with potty training, especially number 2.The doctor recommended that she sits twice a day for ten minutes in a row in the potty, and we decided to buy this toilet seat.Well, two weeks using it and we are finally making progress!!She LOVES her Dora, super pink, flowery potty, so sitting on it is a delight.We were using the potty before, but I thought if we were going to train her for good, it was better to train her in the toilet.And it is very difficult without a toilet seat, because she is not stable.The handles are great, toddlers use them all the time.I would recommend it to anyone for their baby.Because it is not like a big stuffed animal (long and thin) it was very easy for my 4 month old to hug and hold.He's almost 6 months now and can focus on one area or another...it is still big for him.So I can see how for the next few months, he'll still be interested because it is big and he can do more and more with it.my 2 year old niece visited and latched onto it and began imagination play.Even I want to get in it and play!The built in activities on the side are the best.The squeaker is a bit hard to press and sure you will have to do for baby...but the other toys are super!I couldn't be happier;My 10 mo old grandson seems to like to play in it.It will keep him entertained for about 30 mins, which is enough to get dinner started or take care of his older brother.He sleeps well in it too.I did some research before buying this playard and I am very happy i did.It may to be obvious at first, but each of the walls has a bug with some functions.The other bug, when squeezed, makes a sound, the third one, has rattles in its wings, and finally, the sun is a mirror (not a great one though).Given its price and the fact that it is being discontinued, I highly recommend getting one before they are off the market.I have this playpen for about a month now but is still never used by my 6 month old baby.He cries whenever I put him in.What I do not like is that it lacks cushion.It is hard, not soft that I'm afraid when my baby rolls over, e would hurt himself.I am waiting for my baby to grow up a little more, may be he'll like it when he is already able to stand.I hope he would.I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep.My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do.This is a great value pack and so soft and thick in the center panel which also makes them great burp cloths instead of using more expensive and also narrower and thinner cloths actually marketed for the burp cloths.Good diaper cloths!Tiring to change everytime the baby wets the cloth though and time consuming to wash but worth it than having problems with diaper rash.It is really hard to use cloth diapers for the whole day so use cloth during day time and then disposable at night for longer sleep.Don't buy these if your looking for a pre-fold that will hold all of your childs waste in,and if you have a heavy wetter don't weven think about it without a doublerDiaper Doubler - Absorbency Booster - 2 Piece Set(these are nice) they are no wear near as absorbent as chinese prefolds, these make great claning clothgs and burp rags though.It takes some trial and error to figure out the water requirement but that's OK.Cleaning/descaling is the only issue.Great product.I use it at nights.Having the chiller compartment saves me the trip to the refrigerator.Sometimes I forget the ice-pack and will use a ziploc bag with crushed ice as an alternate.As soon as I pop it in the chamber, by the time I am done changing him - it is ready to go.I agree the measuring water is confusing so I just check it periodically to ensure the bottle doesn't overheat.One thing to note is that it heats up glass bottles SUPER fast vs. the plastic bottles.So if you need speedy turnaround use the Evenflo glass bottles - they heat up in under 3 minutes!I purchsed this product because of the cooling capabilities as it was perfect for night feedings instead of running downstairs to make a bottle in the middle of the night.BUT, after just about a month of use (warming 3 or 4 bottles per day) the warmer started over heating the bottles and sent milk pouring out of the top.I use a variety of types of bottles and specifically the Dr. Browns and the First Years Breastflow bottles were overheated and thus overflowed in this warmer.(The Advent bottles did not overflow but were so hot to the touch I couldn't take them out with my bare hands and thus was NOT going to put the bottle near my infant until it cooled down which tool 5 or more minutes.)We played with the amount of water we were using, thinking we were putting too much in (even though we were following the recommended water usage in the instructions).After having the product for less than 2 months we are returning it to the vendor where it was purchsed.I would not recommend gettin this product.First Years needs to go back to the drawing board on this one and come out with a product that actually works.I love this pump!It's the best single pump I've tried, and I've had a few different ones.I'm pretty sure I first bought this pump when I had my first 6yrs ago.I only used it a couple of times then - we never got the nursing thing to work out.When my second came along, I pulled out this pump and used it regularly for almost a year.(Especially if you may be on a budget)  Yes, I know the motor is loud, and it took a little while for me to get used to it - but if that is something you can get past or it just doesn't bother you, this single breast pump is fantastic for the price.(if you want a quiter one, look at the Medela Swing, but you also pay more)  It only took only 15-20 minutes to pump what my baby could nurse in the same amount of time.I mostly used the AC adapter, but I have taken it on the road and away from home quite a few times with batteries (2 AA if I remember?)and it worked just as well.I have never had problems with burning through batteries, they always lasted a long time, so long that I started using batteries while at home too so I wasn't stuck in one place.If I still had this laying around, I would also use it with our 3rd, who is expected in 2 mos.But I have no idea if we gave it away to someone else, or where else it may have went to over the years.I do plan on upgrading to the Medela Swing this time, and only for the noise factor.Overall this appears to be a decent gate set - it easily configured to fit the area we needed to cordon off from our wee one.However I do have a few issues with the gate that are keeping me from being completely satisfied.The biggest issue, to me, is the door release.Basically, you squeeze up on the handle and then pull the door up.Plus, did I mention it takes a lot of effort?It's not as well designed as several of the other gates we've used.The second point is just how narrow this gate is.I am not a large person and while I do fit through the opening I do worry that some of my larger friends may have a harder time of it.This width of a coach class airline seat, maybe a tad less, and you have idea on the width of the opening.Their are some good points.It does feel very secure.It may be the best gate for versatile areas where traditional gates don't fit.However if you can avoid this gate and go for something else - you might be better off looking around.This gate has solved all our problems.The door does not swing closed behind you, which I like.The bar across the bottom of the door is very low compared to other gates, about an inch.When the door is closed it is secure, much more so than our gate that swings shut behind you.The entire system spans 72" and is very stable, even when my 1 year old shakes it.This gate is a great solution for difficult areas and is well worth the money.The advertising for this gate made it seem like the right purchase for me, but I was wrong!And if it breaks, you're out of luck with installing this gate.The wall mounts are not the same as shown in the Amazon picture, which is in the middle of the panel!This became a problem for me because I have a window ledge that is lower than the wall mount location.Third, this Kidco gate is clearly terribly overpriced.If you have an irregular shaped area or room that needs a gate, I'd recommend that you look into the North States 3 in 1 Super Yard Gate.I bought this North States Gate with a total of 6 panels (12 feet) and it did not have any of the problems I just described.It was expensive, but cost less than the Kidco.Overall, it is sturdier and better made too.Well i procrastinated and didn't put it up till this week.problem was i could not find the adhesive to attach the thing to the table.So i improvised.finally we put it on the table, it has just enough give to put on and off but not enough that LO will pull it off easily and huge plus for us...no damage to our pottery barn table!once i get so me photos i will attach but for the moment it is serving its purpose and we are very happy!another plus we had about 6 inches left over that we used to cover our desk pull out keyboard thing.can't beat that.Cuts easy, tape is sticky and hasn't peeled off.I put this on my coffee table and it works great.Seems pretty secure and there will be no split foreheads with this stuff on the edges!Love that it wipes clean if it gets messy2)  Built in pee guard for boys...  We had another seat with a snap on attachment, and of course it got lost while our daughter was using it.3)  very sturdy and stable on toilet.This seat positively sits on the toilet, and my son is comfortable on it for even long periods of timeWe tried the soft plastic ones, and ironically he complained a lot more about those being uncomfortable than this one.this fits my elongated toilet which the padded cartoon character seats will not.It's easy to clean too - there are no crevices like the padded seat.The splashguard doesn't really do much for boys and because of it, my son can't keep his legs close together like he can on the mini toilets in his daycare, so he has to be very conscious to not spray when he pees.I think it's a bit bulky for travelling.There is an adjustment wheel located at the back of the seat by the handle to adjust the Toile Trainer to the size of the regular toilet seat.We have elongated Kohler toilets and the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer adjust to fit snugly.The reason I am rating it 4 stars is the adjustment wheel started slipping after a few removal and reinstallations.Now if I have to reinstall the seat, I pre-adjust it and then position it onto the regular toilet seat.It does not slip and slide.My 2 year old daughter can lift it up and put it on the toilet.It is very easy to clean.Great product.In a move of overzealous anticipation which has become common for me, I bought both this toilet trainer seat and the Bjorn stand alone potty for my daughter when she was 18 months old.Obviously she didn't do much with either, but she liked to sit on the stand alone potty and pretend she was going, or put her stuffed animals on it to make them pee.Fast forward to about a week ago, she just turned 2 in August, and she uses this toilet trainer all the time.For some reason she will not use the stand alone at all.Partially it is because she is so fascinated with seeing what is going on that she leans back and the pee goes out, so it is not actually a flaw in design.I love that it fits in my (formerly) diaper bag, so she always has a clean toilet seat, even while travelling.I was skeptical of this seat initially, but bought it anyway based on the reviews, and boy am I glad I had this on hand and ready to go, because when the timing is right, it's right!They thought about the little things that would make this better than the competition.My daughter really likes her pink potty seat.I purchased this toilet seat along with a potty book for boys (and no potty).He learned to go on this by itself, I was amazed at how fast he learned.This toilet seat is versatile and you can take it along anywhere you go!It doesn't shift side to side and feels like an extension of the real toilet seat because of how secure it stays in place.If you've ever had a kid fall into the toilet you know important that feature is!Seat works well, adjustable & fits our toilet well (standard seat).Stays in place well, and my baby can sit on it himself (he is 5 months old).We've been using it since he was 3 or 4 months, and it worked well then too.It's hard to get excited about a potty seat, but my toddler loves this one.We keep the BabyBjorn Toilet Trainer on a low hook next to the toilet for him to grab.He can carry it by the little rubber handle and (with some help) put it on the seat.I've already adjusted the potty seat to fit our elongated toilet.It fits round toilet seats too with just a turn of the dial, which makes it great for travel.I wish it came with a travel bag/carrier of some sort.(I'll have to make my own travel potty kit: an old duffel bag, flat-folding step stool, flushable wipes, disinfectant wipes, antibacterial hand gel, etc.)It's made of the same durable material as the seat that came with our white toilet so it matches perfectly, and it's easy to clean.I expect the guard in the front will keep things where they're supposed to go -- we haven't had a "full" event yet, but fingers crossed.It adjusts to fit most toilet lids- does not fit well on grandma's already contoured seat.It has the nice guard in front to help minimize over shoot.(Petite = 20 lbs, 28 1/2 inches tall, wearing 12 mos clothes).From the minute I unpacked her potty, she walked right over and sat down on it, diaper and all.We have now successfully integrated it into our diaper-changing routine, and she fits nicely.I like that it's backless in that it's easier to sit behind her and make potty time a relaxing time, while I hold a book in front of her.I do wish it had a higher back, a la the bigger Baby Bjorn potty, so that she had something to rest her back on for long sits.I would suggest this potty for parents who are introducing potty training early, including but not limited to EC'ers.This is the best potty.It stays really clean because it's just one piece of shaped plastic.This is a no frills, easy to clean, comfortable potty...just as a potty is supposed to be.The price was definitely a plus as well.Cleaning is pretty easy, I wipe with Clorox Disinfecting Wipes 4-Pack: 1 Fresh Scent, 2 Lemon Fresh, 1 Orange (78 Wipes Per Canister - 312 Wet Wipes Total), wash with hot water and spray withClorox Anywhere Daily Sanitizing Spray, 22-Fluid Ounce Bottles (Case of 9)and let dry or wipe dry.started taking baby potty at 2 months - he's 5 months now (17 lbs, 26" tall), & can sit on this potty himself.I was not able to find a babybjorn with the aforementioned essentials.Would buy the same brand, if they made a new version that covers and did not come apart so easily from the base (my daughter take out the center all the time)which can become a problem if she empties the content.They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived.Also, it arrived in one day.But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one.I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose.I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design.We'll be using these for awhile I expect.It's simple to clean, you take out the wipe potty part by hooking some fingers to the front and dump the contents into the toilet.Rinse it and you're ready to go.You can sanitize it with some clorox spray and just put it back down until the next time.It's portable so you can have it anywhere.There is an anti slip rubber on the bottom so no worries about pottying children ending up somewhere else than where you left them.My twins are now potty trained, but I still keep one in the back of the van for emergencies.You never know if you'll make it to the next toilet, you know?Our daughter loves using this chair.It is stable and very easy to clean.=) I had to order 3 since it's seriously the only one he'll even sit on anymore!We have 4 different types/brands, but he (and I) hates them all.Super-easy to dump and clean, he likes to do it himself, and the bottom of the potty is rubber-lined so it doesn't slide around when he sits down/gets up.My son likes that it is his size (we also have a potty seat for the toilet which he isn't so into).Also, we have had no problems whatsoever with pee going everywhere as other reviewers have.Pros:Easy to cleanGrips to the floorSturdyGood colorsRounded edgesCons:Can't remove the splash guardInside bowl can be removed easily by the childWe received this item last week in the mail and I have to say that I am very satisfied with the quality.I was pretty disappointed over all.In any case, every time she stood up from this potty chair she also brought a red mark from the circular opening on her bum.I thought it was a little narrow for her.I personally did not think this was a great potty chair.It's a little lower, but wider and the seat cannot come up with her.She loves the songs, though it's lower and it is actually wider, so even though she is tall, no problems.If your child was like mine, she wanted to follow you everywhere, even the bathroom.She started sitting on her potty to emulate me.After a bit, she asked to take her pants off and that's how we started potty learning.Since the basin is one wrap around tub, I just life it off to clean and put it back.No need to snap things or worry about cleaning crevices.I also like that it is the right size.The back helped stabilize her when she was really small and now as an older toddler, it still fits her just fine.He does not mind sitting on it at all so it must be comfortable to him.Mess cleans out of it easily too.This is a child sized toilet.It is attractive looking.Our 2 year old was easily toilet trained on this and love it.I think it is easy to clean, just remove the inner seat, empty, and rinse.I also like that we can leave it in our half bath and not have to move it when guests come over or when an adult wants to use the toilet.These for cloth diapering?Way too thin for that.These for burp cloths?I cannot imagine how often you would have to reach for a 2nd, 3rd and 4th burp cloth if you had a baby who spit up all the time.lolI disagree with whoever said that these are too thin for burp cloths.I fear that the prefolds would be too bulky for me and not nearly broad enough.I like the simple, large form of these diapers.I use these predominantly as burp clothes.I keep a tall stack on my coffee table, and I'm always ready for errant bodily fluids.I also occasionally use these to wipe up all manner of spills.Tuck one in the car-seat, another in your pocket, and lay one under your baby's head when she goes down for a nap.They don't take up much room in the laundry, so you might as well use them liberally and keep the rest of your life clean and dry!I do not use these as diapers, but I couldn't live w/o them.These are much easier to change and wash than those covers.These are also the best burp cloths.My daughter has really bad acid reflux, and not many burp cloths can stand up to a good spit up.I go through about 5 a day.They are VERY absorbant!These looked huge when I took them out of the package!In short, I love them.She used them with her kids and they are now a necessity in my house.Yep, flat diapers are indispensible for baby.But skip the Gerbers!I'd decided to cloth diaper, and got some fantastic (big, thick, soft) birdseye flats for $12 per dozen, online (Google flat diapers).At the shower I was given some of these, and I thought "cool, some cheapies for the non-diapering situations."I was shocked to find they're not that cheap, and even more shocked at the (lack of) quality.After 5 weeks, these are still sitting untouched on the shelf, even though my tendency to grab my "diapering diapers" for everything has me running short on diapers a lot!He is getting better now after a few months of having them.He throws this on our hard floors and nothing comes out!Playtex does make insulated ones which in my opinion are a lot better for two reasons.The first reason is that my childs hands do not get cold while sipping from cup and second the drink stays a lot colder a lot longer.The valves are easy to put in and take out, my child only has water and milk still so I am not sure how well they will work for juice.these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid.We used the infant bath tub initially but by the time my daughter turned 2 months we started using this inflatable tub.I put it in the tub and though my daughter doesn't sit up yet, she has plenty of room to move her legs and arms while I hold her.Yes, it is more strenuous for my back but it's good fun and exercise for my baby.Also, we don't have much room in my bathroom so we put up two extension rods (like those you use to hang a shower curtain) above the tub and store it on them.This keeps it out of the way though the tub does have a suction cup which works.I can't wait till my baby sits up - I envision putting the Snug Tub out on the porch for her to play in.I also sometimes put a blanket in it and let my daughter 'sit' in it and play with her toys.I find it very versatile.My son can sit up very securely, however he immediately slid.I even bought a tub mat insert to try, and he still slipped.3) It barely fits into our tub.I'm in my 3rd tri and have been sleeping with a snoogle but was finding that my belly wasn't getting the support when I had my back to the snoogle --so I ordered this.But I'm not sure if I would feel like I needed it if I didn't already buy it.After seeing the Boppy wedge, I would have ordered that instead because it's much softer.The drawback to this wedge is that if you wedge too much of it under your belly, it hurts your back --defeating the whole purpose.I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this.The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold.My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her.In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean.I've tried four different products.I'm working to test each product I can get a sample of.I believe most products fit one or more specific needs."White/patterns" absorb a bit faster than "natural" so I like to put "natural" as an outer doubler and "white/patterns" as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine.Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable, free samples, and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use

another product reviewed, please let me know.They are very soft and much more comfortable than disposables.I just throw them in washer and dryer and they still keep the original shape.I don't leak that much, so it's not a problem at all.There are a series of little pegs that must fit into little holes to get it to latch.Now you would think that that's the point of the power strip cover, right?Except the hole that allows the cords to come out the top is so wide that my 9 month old just sticks his hand right inside and can put a finger in the socket.We have a very active 8 month old girl, so we decided to buy 3 of these to cover the connectors, Was very easy to put it on.Would highly recommend this productIt doesn't protect children from sticking their fingers inside the cover.This is easily done even by myself through the top where the cords are supposed to come out.A child can easily unplug anything inside the cover and get their fingers inside, which completely defeats it's purpose.It's somewhat hard to snap and unsnap together.But that's the point, right?I would recommend this to anyone looking to either conceal their outlet strips or babyproof their home.They save time and don't leak - like the standard bags sometimes do.HOWEVER I will only buy the generic ones from now on since they are so much cheaper!You can get both sizes at Walgreen's, Walmart and Target.Save your money!I don't get the purpose of these since the air goes right back in during the feeding(got the special Playtex nipples and bottles).Also, the store brand ones do the same thing for half the price.Walmart ones are not as soft, but do the same thing stillI love these liners.They are a quick and easy way to ensure a sterile container for my milk.I have never had a problem with them leaking except for one time when I was squeezing the air out, squeezed a little too hard and POP!!, breastmilk everywhere.I learned my lesson- squeeze gently, if at all.They are a bit pricey for plastic bags but the convenience factor makes up for it, imho.The amount markings on the bags are a bit hard to read and don't really line up with the markings on the nurser shells, so the only way I can tell how much my LO has taken is to pour out and measure the leftover milk.Otherwise, this is a great product!When I am home, I use the Born Free bottles.When I travel, I use the playtex disposable bottles.It's nice to not have to clean the inside of the bottles every night.We've had very minimal leakage issues.And I do think there is something to Playtex's claims that it reduces gas/air.Also not terribly expensive over the long-run.We used Playtex drop-ins for both of our children.I prefer buying them from Amazon, because they are must cheaper than the store.You get more for your money.You don't have to worry about your child getting air in the bottle.Other than that I love the convenience!Then I came upon these Playtex nursers with disposable liners, and now I only use a regular bottle if I have to.I noticed the difference when I poured 5oz of pre-measured milk that had been stored in a milk storage bag, and when it was in the Playtex bottle, the bottle indicated only 4oz of fluid.Aside from needing to be more conscious of the measurements, this bottle liner system has been a life changing discovery for my household.I have used disposable drop-in liners from multiple stores (Wally-World, the bullseye store, & various drugstores) and find that they all work just as fine as these Playtex ones do, but at half the price.I like that the Playtex liners are thinner feeling, meaning the liner collapses better inside the bottle when baby is drinking...but even with the others feeling like a thicker plastic, they work as well.Playtex, come down in price and you'll get 5 stars instead of only 4.Easy to "drop-in" and you just throw it away.You can even heat up the milk/formula just by putting hot water in a bowl and swishing the bottle around for about 30 seconds!Purchased these clippers to cut my baby's nails.People...please don't get ripped off.These work...but you can get the exact same thing at your pharmacy for much much less.This was the best purchase!!They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great!!!We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it.Great to have in the diaper bag as well - don't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these!!Accessing newborn diapers is a bit difficult since the diapers are much smaller than those used for older babies but that's fine since we won't be using newborn diapers for long.With the wipers warmer in the caddy, it's difficult to see the supplies on the back side and I can only hold a pump bottle of hand sanitizer or a couple of tubes of diaper cream.Other than that, it's a handy product.I don't really like that you have to screw into the railing, but a child's safety is way more important.At the end of the day, it does what it says and keeps the kid from falling though the railing.These are safe no doubt.Easy to installShort...So I need two to cover my relatively small balcony.No more toys and even dishes landing on innocent pedestrians.He is just starting to outgrow the small side (and he is very long for his age), so we just switch him to the other side or put him in the big bathtub if we wish.It is large, but has plenty of room for your child as he/she grows.One of my most useful buys!It's got anti-slip for infants and same goes for the toddler position.Only thing I did not like about the tub was that it's too shallow and my son is big for 9 month.(I'm guessing the depth has something to do with safety).My brother who just has his daughter said his Primo tub was too big so he wanted to switch.Pros..it's bigConsit's too big and waste a lot of water.Which I would not mind if it was bit deeper so my son can get a better submersion but it's not any deeper than the FP whale tub.Main problem is that Flooring is too slippery so my son was startled everytime his bum slipped against the floor.In fact he would rotate and splash around while taking a bath without a problem.With Primo tub he stopped dead on his track, scared that he would slip.I supposed you can put a towel to offset the slipping problem but I think I'd rather look for another tub.I am so glad she told me about this tub, since it is so big and he won't grow out of it for a long time!I imagine that this tub would be great for a newborn as well.before my baby could sit up, it was a huge help to have both hands free to wash him.easy to clean and will grow with the baby.the other tubs out there are way too gimmickyWow -- where do I begin?This tub is, hands down, the very best bathtub on the market.We chose it based on the rave reviews of a trusted friend and the advice of NICU nurses in a baby preparation class we took.She'll be 22 months-old next week and still fits in this tub.Now THAT'S what I call bang for your buck.We got one of those inflatable duck tubs for our daughter's first birthday as a gift.In the eurobath, even at nearly two, she still has plenty of room to sit and play with all manner of bath toys.She sits confidently in the eurobath because she's supported so there's no slipping and scaring her, and there's no worry for us.We'll probably just start putting the eurobath in the adult tub for a while now until she outgrows it.I cannot say enough good about this tub.You WILL NOT find a better tub out there because it just doesn't exist.Other tubs may have "spa" features or temperature devices but they don't hold a candle to this tub.You can buy a cheap rubber duckie bath water thermometer at any baby store and they work fine.This is just the best design on the market and you will thank yourself time again, probably for two years or more, for buying this tub.I really like this tub for my sitting baby.But that's why you're never supposed to leave babies unattended in the bath.They can manage all sorts of crazy things when left to their own devices.The only reason I didn't give this tub 5 stars is because the white tub develops a little brown spot where her bum sits.I clean her thoroughly with wipes before each bath, so I'm not sure why this is happening, and she's never pooped in the tub.I've tried scrubbing it with baby-safe detergents, but it won't come off.It seems to be permanently stained.My daughter freaks out in the bathtub, and I thought that getting a smaller tub would help her to feel more secure.This is the second time I have purchased a Primo brand product (the first time was a Primo potty), and I have been very pleased both times.I think that the plastic could be a little bit thicker, but I think it is durable enough to withstand several years of use.This keeps baby's head elevated even when he can't support it; but baby can sit up on his own later in the other end...Win win!We purchased this tub in transparent blue.It's because the tub has two "sides".One for infants who need to lay reclined, and the other is for older babies/toddlers who can sit up with minimal or no support.Other reviews state that the drain is slow, but I wouldn't know....I use the tub inside our regular bath tub and dump it when we're finished.Our tub is stored hung on a nail on the bathroom door or turned over in the big tub.It's very ergonomic for baby and allows whoever is bathing baby to use both hands for washing.This was the ONLY bathtub I purchased, based on all of the stellar reviews, and BOY was I disappointed!!My baby was only 6 pounds full-term, and this tub was HUGE!!she HATES the tub and we're still doing sink-side sponge baths!!If I had to do it again, I'd get one of the smaller tubs that has the sling-type support!IF YOUR BABY IS A PREEMIE OR IS JUST ON THE SMALLER SIDE, DO NOT BUY THIS TUB - IT IS JUST WAY TOO HUGE AND REALLY HAS NO SUPPORTS!!!!!!!!!!!!UPDATE: I RECENTLY PURCHASED THE MUNCHKIN DUCKY TUB FOR $15, AND I WAS ABLE TO GET HER TO CLIMB INTO THE TUB AND EVEN START PLAYING WITHIN THE FIRST 5-10 MINUTES OF HER LAYING EYES ON IT!!Should've gone with this from the beginning.....Literally, my 3 year old can take a bath in it.He LOVES it, and calls it his "boat".it has both positions for infant and toddler, so really can last a long time.Ok, this is the tub you need, folks.Alex *hated* sponge baths, but he loves his Primo tub.Alex kicks his feet into the water, but I don't have to worry because he is held up by the raised center bumper and doesn't slip too far into the water.The depth is perfect, too - the baby doesn't get too chilled.I agree with some of the other reviewers that the drain is very small for the product size, but really, it's not hard to just upend the tub and dump out the bath water once the baby's out.I also like the indentions to hold the soap and bath products because keeping those in close reach is very handy.My baby is 5 months old and was outgrowing the infant bathtub that sat on the sink.It was the first time he could splash around and the first time Dad heard him laugh!Yes, the drain is really slow so I do what someone else does and use a large plastic cup to scoop the water out so I can refill with clean water.The tub itself is large but the bottom is proportioned enough to fit over a nice size sink.I should have purchased it first.Some reviewers complain about this, but I look at it this way:  we have a tub/shower, and put this bath tub into our bathtub to bathe our daughter.If I had to scrub out our tub every night to get it clean enough for her, that would be a huge pain!To me, this is a much more pleasant bath than sitting in the adult tub as a toddler in only a few inches of water.If you put more water into an adult tub, we've found our toddler slips around too much and feels insecure, even with a mat.Cleaning this tub is a snap.No nooks and crannies for gunk to accumulate.I use a Seventh Generation cleaner with a hydrogen peroxide active ingredient.Durability is fabulous:  We actually never drain the tub with the drain, but lift it and spill the water out.We have a standard fireplace hearth (no odd angles) that is about 6 feet wide and this has worked out great.It sticks to the brick without a problem and my 11mo old plays on our fireplace constantly.I'm sure my kid will still find some weight to hurt himself but hopefully now it won't be a call 911 kind of hurt.We have an older child that likes to play loudly so we put the baby in the back bedroom and I am able to hear when she wakes up.I think if I were to buy another monitor I would get one that has a video camera in it, so I could also see what was going on.But this is a great product considering the price.I got exactly what I was hoping for - a simple inexpensive baby monitor without all the bells and whistles.I can't hear every breath she takes but I can hear when she's in her bed playing and I can hear when she's crying.I usually have it plugged in so I can't comment on how long the battery lasts.Two were total junk out of the box.One worked very well.The first one we got didn't work at all.It was totally useless.The static was so loud we could barely make out noises from the babies room.But, we sent it back and exchanged it for a new one.The new worked great.So, we ordered another one for the other kid's room.This 3rd one was total junk.So, 2 out of 3 were junk.For me, this explains the mixed reviews on this product.Poor quality control.As far as the one that did work, here are some more details about why I liked it.We've tried a few monitors.This one had the least static.For us, static is the most important issue.We hate it.If the monitors have a lot of static it keeps US from getting to sleep.The next most important issue is unnecessary beeping.Some of the other monitors we've used periodically loose the signal from the baby's room, and then automatically reconnects after a few seconds.Each time they loose the signal they beep loudly to let us know.This can happen a dozen or more times each night.No good.THIS monitor does NOT beep when it looses the signal, or maybe it just never looses the signal... either way we're sleeping much better now.FINALLY HAD OUR BABY AND GOT TO TRY IT OUT..THE FIRST TIME I HOOKED IT UP WAS WHEN I RECIEVED IT, I DID HEAR THE NEIGHBORS MONITOR A LITTLE..BUT ALMOST ALL BABY MONITORS WILL HAVE THAT PROB.UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ALOT OF $..BUT THIS HAS 2 CHANNELS TO CHOOSE FROM..I just purchased this because our other monitor was going on the fritz.Our other monitor always interfered with our wifi and had lots of static.This is crystal clear.This is a cheap monitor that does the job.It also has some "white noise" in the background much of the time, but it's minimal.It is a cheap, simple monitor that works well.This baby monitor has amazed me.When I was pregnant I lived in a tiny apartment where there was no need for a monitor, but I put the most basic, inexpensive one I could find on my registry for when we went to grandma's house.As I pulled grass out of the AV port, it was still fully functioning!I am seriously impressed by this product and the value is unbeatable.It's inexpensive and glass - EXACTLY what I was looking for!Don't have to worry about scary plastic chemicals.Great product!!these are the only nipples my baby will take, besides mommy's.They are very hard to find.. and I don't know why since it seems I am not the only mommy who is looking for them.I wish Amazon would offer them with free shipping !!!!!They are strudy and long lasting and you can purchase them in different stages so that the nipples never get old because before they are worn out its time to change them.These are the newborn flow ones and although they are the slowest, it's still not slow enough.I'm trying to breast feed and sometimes he just gets impatient with me (I have a low supply) and wants the bottle.Sometimes I oblige depending on how loud he is and how tired I am.But these are easy to clean and switch out too.I bought 3 types of furniture straps so that I could compare them.Very Sturdy plastic.Well made!It has hands-free opening so its good when you have your hands full like I always do.She isn't heavy enough for the peddle.I have several baby gates so it's not that I didn't install it right.Its just that my daughter could rip this one right out.The others that I had held up when she would do her monkey in a cage routine but this one would rip out.So I wouldn't recommend it.I will definitely get another one if I need one for my other rooms!I have a puggle and boxer, and neither one can jump this gate or accidentally open it.It's the best gate I've ever owned- and I've gone through a LOT of gates!!It is so easy to install- did it myself and I'm not usually good at putting things together.It also has NEVER shifted out of place- ever... and I've had it in a high traffic area (where it's used over and over throughout the day)for nearly 3 months.The other reviewers who note that some parts are made of cheap plastic are right - one of the little click thingies on the bottom of one of our two gates get stuck more than it should, but it still works well enough for our purposes.We use them to block off parts of our house to our one year old and have used them since he started to crawl.We are ordering a third one to block off the stairway upstairs now.There are a few that break more than they should and very rarely a toddler that can figure out how to open them.I recommend it.We love this gate, we bought one to block of the top of the staircase, and we wanted a second one t block off the living area and the kitchen... unfortunately the coverage range of this product is very limited... even with the extensions.The gate overall is made out of solid material.It would be the only gate we purchase only if it could a bigger area.Product delivered on description.Easy to use, install, and hands free.I'm not sure how old the people's children are who said they can open this gate, but mine is 1 and there's no way he's strong enough.The pedal is a great design feature and allows us to move easily in and out while carrying things (garbage?).She has a very hyper golden retriever.Perfect for protecting your baby from many diffetant things.We got this to gate our hallway so our 23 month old twins will stop getting into drawers and wrecking things.We have an old house with the cut glass doorknobs and the door knob thingies are hit or miss on them.It's pressure mounted but it held up quite well to my girls shaking it in protest.The problem is with our baseboards...  and I think most people have baseboards like this so it seems like a huge design flaw.We have really wide 6" baseboards (not common) but at the bottom of that is a bit of round molding, maybe an inch, inch and a half high - and this is where the problem came in - and don't most houses have this??What happened is the little pressure-mounted pads to hold the gate in place had to sit above these moldings, leaving a gap beneath the gate.My husband slid a block of wood beneath this gap (actually one our window props, gotta love old houses!)Not sure yet if I can fix it - I can't figure out exactly where the issue is.This gate seemed like a good idea...  but you need to find a way to fill in the gap underneath, or else it will creep down over time as you push the pedal, and the whole thing will pop out like mine did.I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it will work awesome if you don't have those moldings, and if you can think of a good way to fill the gap if you do (I'm thinking maybe zip-tying the wood to the base?)- it will work great  But it seems like something they should have thought of when they made the gate.edited - we got the gate working again, with a block of wood beneath it.I noticed in someone's "add your own picture" picture they mentioned cutting the molding to make the gate fit.You should not have to cut your wood work!!!Isn't the whole point of a pressure mounted gate so you don't have to alter anything?Make sure you fill in the gap underneath!There are so many pros, so few cons to this gate.It's tall, there's no way my 2-year-old can get over it.Incredibly convenient swinging door.If you follow the instructions on how to correctly tighten it on the door frame you won't have trouble.I didn't do that the first time and I was getting frustrated.I LOVE this gate and would buy it again.I like how it swings open both ways, opens with a foot pedal so it's hands free, and is incredibly sturdy though it's pressure-mounted.My ONLY disappointment with this gate is that it doesn't fit well on our stairs.We live in a small apartment and the wall doesn't jut out far enough from the bottom step in order for the foot pedal to work.This gate is the best.It's truly hands free and child proof.We use it at the bottom of our stairs along with a kidco y spindle.If you have a similar staircase I would say this is the product for you!This gate is much better than most on the market.The design allows it to function well as a gate, yet allowing foot traffic through by the inclusion of a lockable door in the unit.The gate is made of metal, but I deducted 1 star due to the locking mechanism being made of plastic.Only time will tell how much real-world use it will stand up to.Another thing about this gate that I like is the flexibility offered by the availability of extensions -- it is possible to mount this gate pretty much anywhere needed.It was easy to install even with the extension we needed to buy with it.My 4 year old can also use it without any issues which I like.We purchased the white one with the black top over 6 years ago.We taught our kids to step in the middle of the stool & demonstrated what would happen if they ignored our instructions.With these instruction the stool has worked like a charm.Ordered this product about 5 days ago.Must say that I am impressed.She gets up and gets down smoothly from her regular activities (brushing, using the toilet, etc).Highly recommend it to anyone whose child is about to be potty-trained or can wash hands or perform simple hygenic chores.We already had a plastic step stool from Target and a heavy 2-step wooden one but were not satisfied with either of them.I'm glad I did.PROS:- Very sturdy- Entire step surface is covered in non-slip rubber- The base also has non-slip rubber- The underside does not have any sharp or jagged plasticCONS:- Premium priceOur plastic step stool we got from Target worked, but was not ideal.The stepping surface was only partially covered in non-slip materials and the underside had lots of jagged plastic.Whenever I put my fingers around the bottom to move it, I'd poke myself with it and silently (sometimes not so silently) curse the thing.The Target one and the Babybjorn are the same height (6 inches) so if your child needs something bigger, obviously this won't work for you.My oldest child needs to get on their tippy toes to reach the sink and it works well for our younger child while going potty.The larger wooden 2-step stool worked great for reaching the sink, but it was just bulky and moving it so adults could use the sink was inconvenient.Both my kids have used the Babybjorn Safe Step Stool for about 3 weeks and have never come close to tipping it over or falling.The base is very wide compared to the other plastic step stool we have.I'm very confident in the stability of the step stool and if my kids fall off of it because they were careless or put all their weight on the very edge of a corner, well, then they'll learn to balance better next time.Even with the premium price, I highly recommend it and I would purchase it again.All sippy cups leak a little, especially with a child that throws it around like a toy.However, these seem to hold up the best of any brand I've had.I seem to loose mine.This is my first baby and I got very sore and cracked nipples from breastfeeding him.Using these with A&D; Original Ointment Tube for Diaper Rash & All-Purpose Skincare Formula - 1.5 Oz between nursings, and pumping for two days with only nursing a few times, was the only thing that worked to heal my severely cracked nips.)I wouldn't recommend them for leaking.They seem to make me leak more, as I rarely leak when not using these.They also will soak your clothes if you don't empty them VERY often, and then bend over to pick something up!I can see them being useful for collecting milk while breastfeeding.They are larger than I imagined them being, but they aren't very noticeable if you wear a padded bra.when i pump or nurse i leak on the other side.These do save mik and allow your nipples to breathe, but there are things to consider before trying...If you have short nipples you should be aware of the following:-  The back piece has a hole that is not flush with the breast.It is about 1/3 inch from the base of the nipple at the areola, so if you have nipples that are short, the milk won't make it into the cup and instead catches between the silicone back and your breast.If that gap fills up then the milk will go into the cup.MESSY to remove at that point.-  You have to wear a nursing pad over the bottom of these for the reason listed above, or wear a soggy shirt.If you have large breasts you should be aware of the following:-  These are not shallow, they stick out almost an entire inch.I am a 38DDD and these things made me look like I had GIANT mounds for nipples.- These will really press into your breasts and may get uncomfortable for anything over 10 minutes.For all gals with any sized breasts, know this:-  You can only wear them 40 minutes at a time, according to the insert, because they put undue pressure on the base of your milk ducts.-  When I rest one of these shells in my hand it is bigger than my palm, be aware that these are not small or discrete; you would probably only want to use these at home or if you didn't care if people think you possess giant, puffy nipples.-  An hour after I used these my left breast had sharp pains, I PRAY it isn't an indicator of a blocked duct.FYI: I had no pains before using these.I gave 3 stars because they do what they say, just not very comfortably.But if you have perky & petite breasts with long nipples, these may work really well for you.Maybe reserve the orange one for carrots?I really don't care about this, so I use them all for carrotsFood can build up around the back edge of the plastic coating.They do have the advantage of an extra long handle and they change color with temperature, but the plastic coating is too thick and too soft, and the spoon is uncomfortable to hold.Worst of all, I find the sassy spoons taste like plastic,  Yuck.I'd trade them all in for these meal mates spoons.I just like these spoons best.I use these spoons a lot for feeding my eight months old twins.The handle is made of stainless steel while the spoon basin is made of BPA and phthalates-free plastic.( I emailed the manufacturer to find that out and they responded quickly).I would give the spoons five stars if not for this.I hand wash them, so I can not say how they withstand dishwasher.Actually, I found spoons that are made in GB:Avent Weaning Spoons 2-pack, but they are pricey.My 2 month old daughter went from drinking 3-4 oz per feeding to about 5 ounces and after adding the water and formula there isnt any room left to shake the bottle to mix the formula nicely.It's a terrible design because the rubber on the back side covers the air vent and the spout so the air gets sucked into babies mouth instead of back in the cup.Boo!I was really excited to still use my Avent bottles to transition to cups, but this prodect doesn't cut it, I ended up buying other sippy cups.My son is still chewing too much for the green spouts--hello, toothmarks!I haven't had a leak problem with these yet, and they're soft so they don't hurt DS's mouth if he whacks himself.I'm so glad they sell these separately.Cheaper than having to buy new sippy cups!It is nice and soft and cuddly, and made of much nicer fabric than that ghastly polyester grayco liner, but I did not find it helpful and I did not find that it positioned my baby any better than she was in the carseat on her own.My main concern with this product is not that my baby will fly out of her carseat in a crash as warned by the 1-star reviews, my concern is that this did not prevent her head from flopping FORWARD -- infact, it was difficult for me to position the head pillow in a way that didn't make forward-flopping worse.This chin-to-chest posture can restrict airflow.Newborns can't necessarily protest or lift their heads to compensate when they're being deprived of oxygen.I was warned about this at my baby-carrier group (before the sling recall, where some of the babies died for this exact reason) and it was something I worried about when my daughter was young because her head seemed to always fall forward in the carseat, even when it said it was well-positioned.I would not recommend this product to a new parent.It looks really cozy, but it didn't stop my daughter's head from flopping in the direction I consider most dangerous, and it really only even fit around her in her carseat for a matter of weeks anyway.I love other products from this company (like the swaddle-me!!!)but the snuzzler is just another piece of baby junk that I could have done without.This bottle works great with my Medela pump in style, using the Playtex Breast Milk Storage Kit.I like that this bottle can use the same nipple as the Dropins.Our daughter has never had any issues transitioning between breast and bottle.My daughter has never had any problems with spit up or cholic so I all I can say is that these bottles didn't create any problems.Pros to using the VENATIRE WIDE/NATURAL SHAPE is that they're reusuable so no additional cost like the dropins.You don't have to use the bottle rings that come with the kit, as they fit right on the adapter.Just remove the bottle from the adapter ring after pumping, put the sealing disc on, and store until feeding.I've found that the storage kits (deluxe kit and the ones in the permium nurser gift set) including sealing discs that are the flimsy silicone pieces that fit into the nipple ring work better with the Ventaires than the sealing discs in this kit.We've had a few leak from the top when mixing (we have to add some prune juice for our daughter) a bottle with the hard top sealing disc.We store these bottles on their bottom in the fridge, and have never had a problem with leaks.It only takes a few minutes since, and whalaa (NO NEED FOR A BOTTLE WARMER!We warm Dropins this way too, it's a little faster since the liners are thinner).When the bottle is warm remove the sealing disc, & the insert the nipple.I have never tried freezing milk in the bottles although I know that the storage kit is advertized to be able too.If I have extra milk I just freeze it in an ice cube tray, and store in Ziploc freezer bags.This system has turned out great for if lil' one finishes her bottle and is still hungry but doesn't need another entire feeding, just put a cube or two in...no wasted milk!OVERALL, THIS BOTTLE IS A GREAT CHOICE FOR THE BREASTFEEDING MOM WHO CAN'T BE READILY AVAILABLE 24/7 :)This is the only bottle I've used for my baby.A lot of moms who don't have colicky babies use the bottle because it's such a trustworthy product.Plus, the bottom comes out so you can just use a sponge to clean the bottle.If you do use a bottle brush (I do sometimes) you don't get sprayed with soap or water as the opening to the bottles are wide enough to prevent the mess.They came very quickly, well packaged.I shopped around and every time I do I end up coming back to Amazon.Excellent product!Dr. Brown's bottles didn't solve the gas issue, but neither did Playtex Vent Aire.Aside from the fancy name, Playtex did not reduce baby's painful gas (from breast milk).Also, the bottom can leak if not forcefully tightened - I lost 2 ounces of precious breast milk with these lousy Playtex bottles which were recommended by the women's clinic.For people who produce little breast milk, losing 2 ounces is like losing large 24 karat gold nuggets in the sink.I think that I heard the venting taking place ONCE when Playtex Vent Aire was dry.All Playtex does is make you vent your frustrations in the product reviews.These Playtex bottles leak horrible, and when you place them in the bottle warmer even worse because they get water in middle of the bottom rim, so they will be leaking anyways, for the amount of parts to clean up, I did not mind I'm used to it, cause I've always used Dr. Browns wich have several parts, these Playtex bottles got my baby full of gas wich defeats the porpouse of them bottles, they make so much bubbles in the nipples you can see and hear them, and the last thing is the nipple collapses so bad my baby stoped getting the flow and the nipples are really hard.bottom line, I ordered my 3 set of Dr. Browns wide neck shipping next day and I'll be ordering a second set very soon.Dr. B best bottles ever specially for gassy babies.I dont know what kind of crazy closet bar we have, I know it is new and was purchased at a hardware store...and these do not fit.These are really light too, unlike the spoons that have metal conponents.Don't go with the more expensive spoons.This is a good enough idea, but it doesn't work.I just got this a few days ago and it does not stay on.It falls off about 3 times a day.If I use the oven it falls off within minutes.We bought this for warming milk bottles for our baby, cold ones from the fridge and room temp water for formula.It is a very good product.Pros:- Quick and easy to use- Warms liquid uniformly- Fits bottles of all sizes, including the odd shape Tommee TippeeCons:- The steam is very hot and picking bottle out during heating can cause burns if not done carefully- No temp control, and thus getting the right temp is a hit and miss and requires trial/error everytime- Once the heater switches off, need to wait for 5-10 mins before using a second time (we did find a workaround of pouring cold water to let the element cool which allows immediate reheating)A must have for every nursery and mom whether warming formula or preserved breast milk from the fridgeThis bottle warmer is easy to use and works quickly.We've been using it for a month and haven't had a single issue with it.We found that it can only heat up one bottle every 10 minutes, which is a real problem when you are trying to heat up two bottles or you mess up the first time, and its too cold or too hot, which is common with this warmer because you are constantly adjusting how much water to put in.At 3AM, this is just too much trouble.Also, it lacks a countdown timer, a memory for how long you needed the warmer the last time, and doesn't have a water reservoir.I wasn't sure if we really "needed" this product, but now that I have it, I can't imagine life without it!If you breastfeed, and are using pumped or express milk, this is a must have.I don't have to worry about boiling water or anything.The steam heats it perfectly every time!I highly recommend this product.This product did work, however, for my standard size Playtex Vent Air bottles but did not heat up my friend's wide mouth bottles when she tried to use it.All in all, this was a pointless purchase on my part; but the return of the item was easy cheesy!This product is poorly constructed, requires patience and you don't have that with a baby crying.It doesn't heat to a temperature the baby would like, so you end up having to cool the bottle afterwards.After awhile I just gave up and stopped using it.I bought this warmer thinking it's more convenient than warming milk with hot water, but actually it is not...the amount of water needed is little therefore it has to be very precise to get to the temperature you want!It takes longer to fill the correct amount of water than needed.Overall this product works as documented/expected.The only reason for not giving a full 5 star rating is that the heating is not consistent.Even if you use the amount of water as recommended in the documentation, the heating is not consistent.The milk will be too hot or too cold occasionally.I wish they had perfected the heating time based on actual temperature of the contents.First off, mine was white and it looks like they changed the shape and color now, whether that matters, I don't really know, or care.This is the most awful product.Nope.The ONLY thing it does is get the actual bottle hot.Almost too hot to the touch, but if you test out the actual formula, it was literally ice-cold.Like straight from the fridge.Awful, awful product.I find these mixed reviews odd, because apparently for some, it actually works and for others, like me, it doesn't do ANYTHNG.I don't know about those positive reviews, but for me, it was just utterly dissapointing.I often have to make bottles on the go or at other people's houses and this allows me to mix formula within SECONDS with virtually no bubbles!This mixer is great.I dont like shaking bottles cause it makes them foamy and I inevitably get formula on me.Also when your done mixing bottles it is great for chocolate milk and grown up drink mixes.My son has reflux and the doctor said to put some rice cereal in his bottle.item was just as described my ds just wouldn't take the rice cereal from the bottle.we have to spoon feed it to him.I know that many people out there do this and I'm sure this nipple would work out great, however I did not use this product after all.I looked for spoons that I could take everywhere and didnt had to wrap on a napkin (annoying) and found this.Read some reviews before buying it and I agree that one doesn't fit ...instead of placing the 8 of them, only 7 fit but that's not an issue as I dont use all in one day so I just leave one outside for next time.Will definitely recommend.However, only seven of the eight utensils will fit with the lid on the case.This didn't matter much for us, though - we just leave a spoon at home!He is old enough (fifteen months) to be able to use a pointier fork, so I will be checking soon to see if one of our sharper forks will fit in the case.And, as it says in the title, colors can vary.Ours is orange and yellow, which I like better than the pink in the picture since it's more gender neutral.These are very good.Only problem I would say is that there is no way to tell which are fast, medium or slow - there are no markings.When you have Dr. instructions on feeding your baby (as I do, she has swallowing issues), you need to have different nipples and these are a drag without having a system of telling which are which.To figure out which it is, you have to put liquid in each one and see how fast it comes out.Easier to just keep them seperate all the time!Silicone is not thin as the others we have tried.Price I paid is about right.My kids are not complaining.Made in USA.... these are pretty good.I'd give them more stars for seeming durability and accurately described as "fast flow," but fewer stars because the base circumference SEEMS to be smaller around than the other nipples.We just shake the bottles with a paper towel around the top... weird, but it does the trick alright.I'd probably buy them again if they were $1, but with the leaks, a few cents more for another brand is probably best.It is hard to EXACTLY push the cap down directly onto the nipple and keep the nipple at 90 degrees.The tightness of the fit with the base of the screwtop nipple lock causes it to skew to one side, leaning the nipple...meaning that anytime you turn the bottle with the cap on and the liquid hits the nipple opening, you are prone to have a leak.I've had these caps fill with Similac when the bottle topples over in a diaper bag...try feeding a hungry baby in a mall with a cup full of milk that is about to leak all over everything...not fun...To improve the product, there should be an upside-down saucer-shaped plastic piece in the dead center of the inside of the top of the cap.Avent bottles seem to almost weld themselves shut after a few hours in the fridge.Try opening an Avent bottle with this cap on.About half the time, the condensation on the bottle requires me to take the cap off to get leverage on the Avent screw-on nipple locking ring.But maybe it's just me...I don't know.On the plus side, they are very easy to clean, very easy to stack, and float nicely in a sink full of water.These are just bottle caps...what do we expect?I find when I run them through the dishwasher, inevitably at least one flips over and fills with dirty dishwater by the time the cycle is complete.Given that we always have lots of bottles in circulation, it pays to have a few extra.One trick to get them from flipping over in the dishwasher and collecting water is to place four of them together face down and pin them down by putting a bowl on the top of them to weigh them down.Do that and they'll always come out clean.The sippy spouts used to get covered with dust, lint, etc., but with these caps that's no longer an issue.We are buying more of these.We bought two originally to keep our door cracked and the baby room door cracked so we aren't opening and shutting doors all the time.It's just enough to let the crying noise through but not the lights from the rest of the house.They have withstood twin teething toddlers, and fit our doors great.We live in a house with doors from the 60s.Most of the bad reviews about these are on exterior doors being slammed or blown by wind... all I can say is they can withstand the slamming of a toddler really well.I didn't realize that it costs just as much in the store near by where I live.Now I just get it from the store then I dont have to wait for it to be shipped.Check the price at your store first to see if they carry it and how much it costs.I get mine from walmart.nice product but just as easy to buy the generic store brand at a cheaper price.I have a little two year old Houdini who figures out how to escape out of anywhere and can get into everything, no matter how much I child-proof.We purchased this so he would stop getting into his closet when he was meant to be taking a nap.I was disappointed that the doors of his closet where too thick for this, so make sure that you measure thickness before you purchase.It still does the trick, as it is too high for the little one to move.Great toy!The cups are durable, the colors are nicer than shown online, and they stack well.This is one of my daughter's favorite toys.What a simple toy!Well, at first all he did was scatter them about.Then he started banging things with them.Finally, he started to study them and spent a lot of time at this activity.At the present time, our boy is 15 months old.Now he takes the stack apart, arranges the cups on a flat place, goes back to get them and put them back together in the proper order.I sometimes mix them up on his flat place and turn a few upside down.He immediately goes to the pile and sorts them out in the proper orientation and order and rebuilds the stack.When he's whiny or grumpy, I give him the stack and that immediately grabs his attention.In the bath.In the car.My son has been playing with these since 8 months old and its his favorite toy.He will cry if his stacking cups are not around!Colorful, easy to stack from big to small or small to big order, he loves to knock them over.Durable, I've washed these in a bleach solution several times and they hold up great.Also can be cleaned in the dishwasher!The label states this product was tested for lead and BPA.cute simple toy.I bought this when my daughter was 6 months old and its one of our favorite toys!She enjoys banging it around, looking at the bright colors and finds different ways to play with it.Now at 14 months she is trying to stack them and put one inside the other.Very good buy!I picked these up on sale, and was not expecting much from them.Turns out my son loves them and I do too.They are portable (easily fit into a bag), quiet, don't break when thrown on the floor, and still hold his interest after months of owning them.Amazing how something so simple can be so entertaining.He nests them inside one another and inside out and stacked up.He likes to clank them together as well.These are fabulous, I have 4 kids and I have purchased a few sets now.My original set from the 90's still looks like new.I put mine in the dishwasher on the top rack and they clean up very well.A couple of scratches, but not worth sending back for.A previous review said the Walnut color was more cherry.I wanted more cherry so I ordered the Walnut.Walnut IS dark Walnut, not a cherry color (fyi).Purchased this less than 1 month ago and had my husband put it together.He spent a bit of time and one of the last steps was screwing in the hinge but it just would not go through!The problem seemed to be the pre-drilled holes were not lined up and the screws were very cheap that he ended up stripping them easily.The hinge works fine although the top does not come down all the way (maybe 1 inch gap, you can push it down but it will pop back up if that makes any sense)...but this is not a big issue for me.It just means my son won't ever be trapped and it's quite unlikely he'll ever crush his fingers in closing it.OVERALL:Attractive looking piece at an attractive price.Not the finest quality but better than a plastic look (for me)(although durable) and it's not particle board either so I would expect it to hold up for quite some time.Fit all of our two year olds toys.He even jumps on it.My experience with the big, bulky, plastic tubs is that infants tend to slide down while bathing them.Thus forcing you to have 4 hands instead of 2.I just drain it, then throw it in the washer.Can't wait to buy it as a shower gift for a friend!Here is what they said:"BABYBJ&Ouml;RN and Plastic Safety: When it comes to the material used in the production of our products, we put significant effort into finding materials that meet our high standards of quality and safety.All plastics used in the production of our Kitchen products fulfill the demands of the European (EEC),and the American (FDA) Standard for plastics, and are classified as food-safe.Through testing, all of our Kitchen products have been designated PVC-free, phthalates-free and lead-free.Recent studies by health organizations such as the National Institute of Health have raised concerns about the safety ofBisphenol-A (BPA) in plastic products.Polycarbonate plastic is not used in the production of any BABYBJ&Ouml;RN baby products and all BABYBJ&Ouml;RN products with a plastic component are BPA-free.Baby loves the spoons and actually he plays with one while I feed him with the other one.The plate looks lovely but does not stay put which is a total disadvantage.Unfortunately, if you have the gate... you will probably have to buy the extension.The extension itself, is very easy to install... it pretty much just side in on either side of the gate.So 5 stars for an easy install.Not much to say but it's most likely a must have product, because an average size hallway will need this extension.The lids stay on tightly and the liquid inside is easy enough for kids to drink out of.There are no valves to clean, the cup itself is easy to clean, and the optional caps are great for capping the cup while in a bag.This cup, however is not completely leak proof when on its side, and if you have kids who shake the cup while it's upside down, you will have drops of liquid coming out of the cup.Finally, an outlet cover that my 18 month old can't figure out how to remove!Even though I see dimensions I can't see that in my head before it arrives, this thing is so itty bitty.it has real weight to it, so it doesn't feel or look cheap at all.I got this after reading reviews for several different diaper pails and I opted for this one since I didn't want to stick my hand in anything or twist things.Pros: easy to use and change the bag.Cons: the smell!Every time I throw a diaper in there, the 1 second it takes for the diaper to enter the compartment is enough to release a foul odor!It does not, however, smell if the whole thing is closed and unused.Only smells when you toss a diaper in.Also, if you want to throw away just a diaper wipe, you can't because the 'trap door' requires pressure (from the weight of a used diaper or your hand) in order to enter the trash compartment.You gotta make sure your used diaper is wadded up tightly because that helps it break through the trap door (with light or barely used diapers, you'll have to probably use your hand to push it past the trap door.I've had to do this several times).I'm disappointed since this performs as well as a regular trash can with a foot-pedal operated lid, which is what we were using before.This really does keep all the smell in.I have used all the major name brands, had lots of samples and use whatever other mom's buy for my showers until I run out, plus I am on my third baby.I liked these at first but now I don't like them as much because my 3 year old sometimes likes to step on them causing damage to the trim they are screwed into.They cannot support the weight because they do not bend.I've also had one break, but the main issue is the damage when these get stepped on.Keep that in mind.Also, I wouldn't call these "soft".UPDATE 2010-02-10: Had another one break... so at least two have broken now.I have removed some other ones because I think they would cause more damage/risk than their worth if my son were to step on them or "play" with them.This was great to keep my toddler from closing his bedroom door and getting up to no good.I just got some velcro and did it on my own.This product has a lot of reviews, and I was nervous about buying because it seems to me something like this will work great for one person and not another.I am so glad I did go ahead and spend the money though personally.I will describe me and my sleep position, because I think maybe if you sound similar to me you will love it too?This pillow has allowed me to sleep on my side much easier than when I was trying to use three or four pillows in different places.It stays in place much better than using multiple pillows and makes me feel much more supported.I love the curls at the top and bottom!Also, this is really the only pillow I use at night, so though it is kind of a big thing, compared to using three or four pillows I feel free!I wonder if I will even want to stop using it when not pregnant anymore, its so comfy.Also, this is my first baby and I plan on having more, so I figure I will get my money's worth.Anyway, I am about 5'3, moderately curvy and busty and I have a lot of back problems pre pregnancy, and this pillow really meets my needs in a way I don't think a standard body pillow would do :) Hope this helps.My wife bought this pillow when she was about 5 months pregnant.Before she had the pillow, my wife was all over the bed when she was sleeping.She would move all around in her sleep and usually had me hanging off the bed by the end of the night.With this pillow, that has stopped.She stays in one place, and she sleeps better.When my wife gets out of bed before I do, I often steal the pillow and sleep with it.Buy this one as soon as you find out your pregnant.I waited and had a few weeks of no good sleep, wing up several times from pressure on my belly.Slept with it for 2 night no and am 4 months pregnant.Just loooove it.The only problem now is that I don't want to get out of my bed in the morning, because it's almost too comfortable.I've been using my Snoogle since September when I had some really bad sciatica issues at only 3 months of my pregnancy, but I'm still not convinced it is the best for me.I was doing this so that the spine of the pillow was along my spine (to keep me from sleeping on my back) when on my left side, but I found myself sleeping mostly on my right side (so I was hugging the spine of the pillow).Since you are supposed to sleep mostly on your left side for optimal blood flow, this week I flipped the pillow & now I am able to sleep on my left side more consisitently, but I'm also finding myself waking up on my back more often than before.My main problem with this pillow, though, is I sometimes wake up with the WORST neck pain & have to put a heating pad on my neck & get a quick massage from my husband and I'm still normally miserable for half the day.Also, I found that the pillow & the pillow case made my neck break out terribly (think cystic acne), but thankfully my crafty mom made me a bunch of pillow cases (for waaaay cheaper than buying them) and my neck has cleared up.So there is something in the fabric of the pillow & the store-bought cases that my skin reacts to.I also haven't been comfortable with the pillow "under" my belly -- I don't know if I'm just bigger but there is no room between my belly & the mattress for the pillow to fit!I can't return it any longer & I don't have the cash to try out the Bobby version so I'll make do.I'm sure I'm sleeping better than if I didn't have the Snoogle, but I'm not one who can rave about it.I was very hesitant to spend $53 on a pillow but once I decided to buy it, it has made all the difference!I've now had it since last September and I still use it every day!Once I found out I was pregnant, I tried to transition from a back/stomach sleeper to a side sleeper and I had a VERY hard time.My hands usually end up hugging the pillow and I switch off on sleeping on my right and left sides.Since I use it every day, it has gotten flatter over time, but it still works and I start my 39th week tomorrow!My only critique is that its difficult to turn from side to side during the night.Still, it has been the best financial investment during my pregnancy!I did not want to spend this much on a pillow.Buy this today!My friend lent me her Snoogle for my pregnancy, swearing it was the most comfortable thing she'd ever experienced.I eventually curled it into an "O" shape and now have it against the wall behind the bed to prop myself up while I watch TV.I also found that it was stuffed too full to give my belly the under-support that it needed.Now I'm using a belly wedge and a regular flat, rectangular body pillow, as well as a couple of other supplementary pillows where I need them.A million times better than this un-tameable monster.This pillow was a life saver while pregnant.I was having a lot of trouble staying on my side (I would roll onto my back) and this pillow helped with that.Glad to have this product!At 7 months pregnant it provides the support I need by taking pressure off your hips and belly when side sleeping during pregnancy.And I am an avid back sleeper, but this helps me to sleep on my side more.Although I do still tend to push the pillow away somehow at night so that I can still get on my back, but I don't end up completely flat on my back (which is good), I end up mor tilted to one side on my back.This pillow has made sleeping during pregnancy so much easier and more comfortable.I didn't realize that the cover was removable so I used the pillow without washing the cover first.I broke out in a rash on both arms for a day after that.Second issue is that the cover has already torn after just a couple of months of use.after purchasing this pillow, sleeping on my side became so much easier because it is so supportive.my back pain was completely alleviated after i started using the snoogle.worth every cent spent on it!offers a lot of support, worth the money  - really good value - I like it better than setting up a bunch of pillows.I started sleeping better my first night with this body pillow.Before I had anywhere from 3 to 4 pillows taking up a lot of room on our queen size bed.Now I use this plus one other pillow I use for under my preggo tummy - I sleep with the "spine" of the pillow along the back of my body - always.I saved the box it came in so when we travel I can take it with me.It may seem a little excessive, but hey, a good nights sleep is worth lugging around a pillow whether it's in the car or on the plane.I was already a side sleeper so that helps.I tried it the way it shows in the picture but after 2 hours my hips were killing me(I have bad hips to begin with).It is very comfortable and I would definitely recommend this to any pregnant woman.My husband even uses it sometimes when he thinks I am not looking.It made sleeping much easier, and I even kept using it for a little while postpartum.I still used a standard pillow for my head, but used this for the rest of my body and felt supported and less likely to roll around during the night.My main complaint was that the cover was difficult to replace after washing, and of course it's expensive.I got the snoogle when i was 4 months pregnant.I'm now 8 months pregnant and it has served me well for 4 months!It serves so many functions.I use it every single night to prop me up as I read in bed (you just fold it into a little ball or "nest" as they call it), and when I sleep, I lay on my left side with the snoogle under my large belly supporting it all through the night.It's so versatile and if I get sore hips, I just roll over onto the snoogle under my back and it takes pressure off my hips.I should also mention that since the age of 13, I've had a herniated disc in my lower back.Well, thanks to this pillow, I haven't had any problems with my lower back at ALL in this pregnancy.If you want to sleep through the night comfortably, I would recommend this pillow.The only negative thing I could think of to say is that sometimes it's difficult if I decide I want to roll over onto my other side.You have to shift and finagle your way around the snoogle.I fully plan on taking the snoogle with me to the hospital!I bought this product when I was 4 months pregnant with twins.I started experiencing back and hip pains and decided it was time to try this pillow.It is especially good for naps and when laying down for bedrest.Ultimately my only problem with body pillow is that it is bulky.At night, it didn't really help with the hip pain as I was still laying with my hips against the matress and no where near the pillow (unless you lay on top the pillow which seems almost impossible when your pregnant).I went to the bathroom A LOT at night and had troubles finding the right position upon returning from the bathroom.In the end it is a great product, but not one you will use on a nightly or even daily basis!My husband loves it though.. he snuggles with it all the time :)I am 5 months pregnancy and this is helping me with my lower back pain.I bought this pillow on recommendation from ladies on my birth board to alleviate hip and back pain, but that's not the use to which I've put it mostly.Don't get me wrong - it's awesome for those conditions, and when I nap, I tend to use it as a long body pillow which has just the right amount of support and width for my stomach and to go between my legs.I'm 5'8" and not a small framed woman, so that might make a difference, but I do know a few petite women who really enjoy it as well.When I first received it, I looked on the back of the cover and it showed 10 or so different ways you can arrange the Snoogle - for lower body, upper body, as a wedge, etc.The only way I can get any sleep is propped up on pillows, which has really been awful for my back.Enter the Snoogle.I curl the Snoogle like a donut so my head is supported by the top, my arm is in the hole so that it doesn't fall asleep, and my upper back is supported by the bottom of the donut.Ankles swollen?Curl the Snoogle up under my legs.Needing extra back and stomach support while lounging on the couch?Wrap one end of the Snoogle around my stomach and curl up the other end behind my back like an upside down U.I got this for my first pregnancy and now I'm using it for round 2.There are both pros and cons to this product.ProsProvides support between knees and under belly.Easy to figure out how to use.Full length back support.ConsPriceyBulky and cumbersome-we have a Queen sized bed and this thing takes up the space of an average(130-160lbs)person.The fabric feels a bit itchy-especially the portion of the pillow that wraps under the head and touches a persons face.Overall, I use a combination of this pillow and 2 regular bed pillows every night.I'm currently 31wks along and have suffered from pinched/herniated discs in my spine prior to pregnancy, so I deal with pain daily & nightly-just the pain level varies.Some nights this pillow is the only way I can get any rest-other nights this pillow is too awkward to manipulate and use so I rely on my regular pillows.If you're not getting sleep, it's worth a try but if you are sleeping ok save your money-this product had little use for me after I delivered my first child and I'm assuming it will return to the back of the closet after this pregnancy too.Pregnant with twins and have been using this maternity pillow since my 12th week.Now in my 26th week and the pillow is as flat as a pancake and has been since about my 18th week.I put it on tumble in the dryer, but nothing is resurrecting this thing.It still adds a little support, but now I have to use a bunch of extra pillows with it.I do agree with other reviews that you can't take the pillow cover off....you'll never get it back on.I don't know how durable it will be as under the pillow case, it looks like the same material as airline pillows.Also, the washing bag that comes with the breast pads are great to use for baby's socks, hand mitts, etc.I don't use the bag for the breast pads, I just throw them in the wash by themselves and haven't lost any yet.They're so bulky that you can see them through clothing very easily.Because they are so small and don't stay in place well, they always seem to be just off to the side of the nipple whenever my milk lets down, so I end up leaking.They're thinner and cover more area.I would try to find flannel ones instead of these.I bought these because I hate using disposables and adding to the waste problem.These are completely flat and don't bend much to contour to your breast or nipple.They are super obvious under a thin bra or tank top.Plus, they stick to you--not horribly but still undesirable.I like the bag that comes with them but overall, I wouldn't buy this product again or recommend it.I haven't had one embarrassing leaking accident!I leaked right through them several times before I just decided to purchase some disposables with plastic backing.When my milk leaking slows down a little, I will start using them again.I just bought these and have been using them for a few weeks.They work well for moderate leakage--too light and they stick, too heavy and they leak.They pads show a bit more through tight clothing (like a nursing tank) but not terrible like bulkier pads.All in all, I prefer the Nuk washable ones simply because they are less expensive and do not show quite as much.But, you need to pay attention as they do not have #1 super absorbing gels or #2 a waterproof backing once they are full they will leak through.I mostly use them at home and as a second layer when needed inside of a disposable.These pads are only about 4 inches in diameter, so the edges are pretty obvious unless I wear a padded-style bra (I'm about a 34C).They stick, which can make them a bit uncomfortable when removing them to feed the baby or pump.Suffice it to say that I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot...I suppose you get what you pay for (though I don't recall paying much more than about $8 for Dr. Browns).they stood up to numerous washings (free in a regular wash cycle) and stayed put during wear better than any other brands.And they look almost brand new and ready for next timeThat babies are going to hate diaper changes just cause they get all cold and wet.So taking that advice I bought a prince lionheart wipe warmer.When I was reading the reviews on that I notice that lots of people complained that the warmer had messed up thier furniture.I was hoping there was an easier way.Then I found this.The wipe warmer is no where near the wood now.It looks nice too it doesnt look really cheap and it matches everything being clear.I really love this product...I have used these diapers from months 4 through 10 (and counting) in a large rotation of other diapers (from prefolds to BumGenius Organics) and finally feel qualified to write a review.Overall, I have been very pleased.Like all cloth diapers, your success wth a particular brand/style may depend on your baby's build and activity level.We have a small/avg baby and these definitely didn't fit him at 10 lbs, probably more like 12-14.He was EBF at that point still and these didn't have a problem handling the waste.The only problem I am seeing is that as DS gets bigger around, the top can fold down a little bit, causing wicking.I also don't know that they will last for another baby's worth of use, the cotton is starting to pill and the PUL is getting stiff.I was so disappointed when these arrived, they were so large and bulky on my toddler and the velcro didn't hold up.They have become my back up diapers for laundry day.My baby looks like a little spider but she's so cute it really doesn't bother me.They come very clean, they fit great, and they're cute.They can be a little bit bulky and are NOT good for brand new babies (even if they are 10 pounds).My son was 9 1/2 pounds at birth and 10 1/2 pounds at 2 weeks, but I had to wait until he was about four weeks old (12 lbs) to really use them on him, because they were just entirely too big at first.I bought these just to compare them to my Bumkins and Bummis prefolds and they turned out to be not as absorbent as either.I used them a couple of times and have just decided to put them in storage.They are also impossible to use with the snappis fastner.Definitely not usable overnight.The biggest problem is that it got a pinhole leak in the area underneath the beak, and there is no easy way to fix it.Our first tub for our daughter was the best tub on the market for infants, which is the Primo Eurobath (which can be found on this site) and it has been, hands down, a SPECTACULAR product that continues to be wonderful even now when our daughter is nearly 22 months-old.The only reason we thought it might be time to move our daughter to the duck tub was because she splashes so much now and soaks the walls (and us) when in the Primo Eurobath on the sink top.She's too little to just set in the regular adult tub without some kind of support though.Our daughter is on the small side.She wears size 18 pants at 22 months and she's in the 50th percentile for height, less for weight.When she sits in the duck tub the bottoms of her feet are flush against the wall.It's also very narrow inside so if we put her bath toys in with her, they would be piled on her lap; that would make washing her hard and playing very hard for her.If you buy this tub just know that it's VERY small and it probably won't get you anywhere near the 24  month age it claims to reach.The Primo Eurobath is still plenty big for our daughter at 22 months and will be for a while.The Primo Eurobath is what you need until your child is able to sit up unassisted and is confident in the tub.However, beware that your child must also still be pretty small for this duck tub to be worth it for you.So, being a new mom, I looked at all of the reviews on Amazon for baby bathtubs and I thought that if everyone loved the Primo Eurobath, I'd get that one, even though it didn't look so great to me!It didn't matter that I kept my hands and arms close to her the whole time, or how I tried to soothe her - she screamed and cried and screeched so much through the FEW baths that I gave her (and seemed genuinely scared) that I ended up giving her sink-side sponge baths for the past 18 months (and, yes, I did try the Primo repeatedly, as recently as several weeks ago)!!WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF FIRST LAYING EYES ON THIS TUB, SHE ACTUALLY LET ME PUT HER IN IT (FIRST SITTING ON THE SIDE WITH HER FEET IN THE WATER), AND WITHIN 10 MINUTES SHE WAS IN IT AND ACTUALLY ENJOYING IT!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE PRIMO EUROBATH!!EVEN IF THIS ONE SPRINGS A LEAK FOR SOME REASON (which mine hasn't yet, but I read that in some of the reviews), I'LL JUST BUY ANOTHER ONE IF I CAN'T REPAIR IT!SOOOOO WORTH THE MONEY IF IT GOT MY DAUGHTER TO ENJOY BATHING!Through a series of unfortunate events, I've come to own six different manual breast pumps and two electric ones.My manuals include the Lansinoh, the Medela Harmony and two generations of Avent pumps.This is how they compare (from worst to best):(1)Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump.I own the Freestyle, so I thought that I would like the Medela brand manual.The valve system on this pump is a thin flip attached to hard plastic.It simply does not generate as much suction as the sturdier Lansinoh and Avent valves, and therefore it does not trigger let down as well or get as much milk.If this is the only pump you have, you might not realize it, because you will still get some milk, but when I compared it to my Avent, it was taking about five minutes longer and getting an ounce less per breast.Of course, the lack of cushion also means that milk can't get stuck in teh cushion and leak like the other three pumps, so it's good and bad.But the bottom line is that I have supply problems, so I just couldn't settle for a pump that generated less milk.It's in the garbage now.(2)Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump(aka the Older Model Avent).These pumps are comfortable to use and generate a lot of milk, but the valve system is a small dime sized piece of plastic that pops out while pumping and easily gets lost.Those are a must for Avent users.Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Pump Valves.Also, even though I like this pump, it is annoying that it collects milk in the cushion and spills easily.It shares this problem with the newer Comfort Avent, and the Lansinoh, but not the Medela, which does not have cushion.(3)Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count.This pump is cheaper than the Avent, and uses the same type of valve, so unlike the Medela, it is almost as effective as the Avent at getting milk.Still, I prefer the Avent for two reasons: first, the massage cushion on the Avent has "petal" air pockets that I like, and second, the Lansinoh takes much more effort to pump.My hand gets tired within five or ten minutes of using this pump, which is not a problem I've had with either the Medela or Avent pumps.I think it is because the diaphragm on the Lansinoh is much thicker.(4)Philips AVENT BPA Free Manual Breast Pump(aka the Newer Model Avent).These pumps are the best.The most comfortable to use, the short neck can be placed right next to the breast.They also get the most milk without making my hand tired.The only disadvantages are that they are somewhat harder to assemble than the Medela and can't accommodate different nipple sizes, cost more than the Lansinoh and require special Avent shaped bottles (usually included).Still, the assembly difference is small, and I can learn to control milk spill.Comfort and milk matter most to me, so I enjoy this pump the most.If, heaven forbid, I need a seventh breast pump, I will buy another one of these.After reading the great reviews I went with this tub.During the first use I was frustrated that my baby kept sliding down the sling.I quit using it for awhile and just used the foam turtle in the kitchen sink.At 3 months he moves a lot.He is constantly sliding too far over to the side or his bottom lifts up on to the bump.I turned him to the infant/toddler side and he is not really ready for that.So basically this tub has been pretty worthless.Arrived quickly.Next day.Cant wait to use it.The sling worked perfectly in the first few weeks so that is why i got this one this time.We just began using this with our 6 wk old.Fits nicely into our sink & holds infant well in sling.Only issues I have are that it is a space hog and the drainage hole doesn't get rid of all water.It's lighter and smaller, so it's easier to work with too.The only complaint is that your baby's arm may get stuck to the side of the inclined seat.Be cautious.Didn't happen to us since our baby is still small but I overheard a woman mention it at the store.I love this tub because there is a newborn "seat" and an older infant "seat" and my baby likes both.For us, the hammock never worked.When we put her in the hammock, the hammock just wrapped around her.Also, the second time we used it, the non slip pad came unglued.Kind of poor workmanship, but overall the tub works great for twenty bucks.I saw ones in the store at Babies R Us for $50 - no need for that!My husband and I were too nervous to bathe our newborn daughter in the sink and she hates having sponge baths.We used this tub with the sling in it for the first time last night (the night it arrived in the mail!)Make sure you adjust the sling before you put baby in it though.We put her in and water got in her ears because it was adjusted a bit low in the water.Also, it could be a drowning hazard.Watch your baby!I am looking forward to bath time now.It is bulky to store, but she'll only be using it for a relatively short period of time, so it's a non issue.the only thing i would want different is a draining hole on both sides instead of one side, but that is very minimalIT WAS SHIPPED VERY FAST AND FITS PERFECTLY IN THE KITCHEN SINK....MY GIRL LOVES IT..THE SLING HOLD THE BABY VERY SNUG WITH NO WORRIES OF HIM FALLING OUT...I THOUGHT THE PLUG WAS SUPPOSED TO CHANGE COLOR WHEN THE WATER WAS TOO HOT LIKE OTHER TUBS BUT IT DOESNT..ITS VERY LIGHT BUT NOT TOO FLIMSY...IT DOES THE JOB WELL WHICH IS ALL THAT MATTERSIt is easy to clean and dump as it is really light.I like the little tray area at the bottom because I was able to warm up his soap and lotion in some warmer water in that area.I was very confused to narrow down on a bath tub for my new born daughter initially, after reading the reviews for this bath tub, me and my wife decided to give it a try for my new born daughter.It fits well in our bath tub, It is really a good bath tub and good value for money.At first I loved it - I was ready to give it 5 stars but decided to wait on writing a review until I had it for a little longer.Well - he got too heavy for the sling and I started using the tub.Well after about 1.5 months of used w/o the sling, I noticed some bumps on my son's bottom and back.At first I thought it was diaper rash, but then I began to suspect the foam on the tub.I did a before and after inspection of my son and sure enough no rash before the bath and after bath a big rash!!So, I'm now buying a tub that is all plastic.My belief is that the foam is collecting some sort of mold.I guess it's not good enough to just rinse and let it air dry?2 stars instead of 1 because it was useful during infancy.We gave our newborn his first bath in this tub.I love the sling and don't have to worry about holding him all the time.He loves taking baths.This tub fits perfectly in our sink.Any splashes will just go down our sink and not all over our countertops.It fits in the sink perfectly.Our little guy is very comfortable in it.He's not ready to leave the sling yet, but we are sure the tub will serve him well when he does.It is on the side of where the faucet is on the sink.My little one is 6 months old now.We've been using this tub in the sink since he was a few weeks old.We have been using it for 5 months.Our baby has always been in about the 50th percentile.We wash the sling in the washing machine and line dry it after every use.It has held up so far, and have no reason to suspect that will change.Since we haven't used it as a toddler tub yet, I can't speak to that.We've used the infant side with and without the sling and loved it every time.My baby gets scared very easily when she doesn't feel secure and will flare her arms and cry.I wanted to make bath time was as stress free as possible, so I decided to purchase this tub because it has the hammock that can hold her and make her feel secure.Bath time is SO much easier now and she has learned to enjoy it.I very much recommend this tub because it is something your newborn will grow into.He is now a month old and looooooooves bath time.Great tub for the money.He was able to sit on the "infant/toddler" side even before he could sit up on his own.At about 5 months, he was too big for the infant/toddler side.(He has always been 25th perc weight and height).This tub also fit perfectly in our sink and could be easily stored away in our kitchen closet when not in use.We replaced this tub with the Primo Euro tub which.as a 13 month old, he is still using.I would recommend this as a newborn tub.If you want a tub that can serve as a newborn and true toddler tub, buy the Primo and use a sponge pad on the newborn side.I am convinced, however, that there is no such thing as a "newborn/infant/toddler tub" that will fit your baby at each stage and that you will end up buying at least one tub as your baby grows.Both my husband and I HATE this one so much that we actually avoid using it.When we are holding our baby and trying to shake the formula out into a bottle, it often ends up spilling onto the counter because of the flat lid.The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping.ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3.The Sassy dispenser would have been a waste of money, had we purchased it ourselves.Get the Munchkin dispenser instead.Just had a baby five days ago, and the first two days he breastfed beautifully, even though I have an inversion problem.Imagine my dismay when my little champion suddenly stopped being able to latch on once my milk started coming in more fully and I swelled up like a balloon.After a frustrating 24 hours and trying every trick in the book, I decided to break down and buy one of these.What a godsend!He latched on right away.I've read my supply might get low so I've started pumping three times a day between feedings just to be sure (saving the extra milk for those nighttime feedings that daddy can help with).Hopefully we'll be able to wean off the shields eventually, but for now they're keeping us on the breast and from having to pump 8-12 times a day, so I'm relieved!Update: Should've consulted a lactation consultant, apparently this was totally the wrong size (I guess this is the size they use for preemies in the NICU) and may have contributed to a low milk supply problem (though apparently I also have a nodule on my thyroid which may have caused that problem).I urge you to contact an LC before using, but it's still a great product!She was 6 lbs at birth but completely healthy.The product is bigger than a bottle nipple.It's to wide and sticks out to far.It gagged her so she would not use it.This one is bulky.I may have ordered the wrong size so I would say contact a lactation consultant or your hospital's doula for help.The one I used that worked (4 years ago) was given to me in the hospital.There is nothing wrong with the nipple shield, and it arrived in good time and good condition.This isn't the fault of the product or the seller, but my own inexperience, and I thought I would leave a review to give a little bit of advice based on what I found out after I bought it.I had to use a nipple shield with my first child because, like many others, I have short nipples and he had a hard time latching, especially because he was given a regular nippled bottle in NICU, so he didn't really want to work to learn.Now that I am pregnant again, I wanted to be prepared, so that I have one already, just in case I have the same issue - because last time, it took them a long (frustrating and stressful) time to decide to suggest it, so I ordered a couple to have them handy just in case.When I opened the package, I realized that these ones (standard size) are WAY bigger than what you need for a newborn.If you try to use one of these with a newborn (you can tell just by looking at it in person) the poor baby will have more than a mouthful of plastic and it will interfere with the actual eating.I don't have to worry about plates being thrown on the floor or food getting all over a potentially dirty table.It sticks to almost all of the tables we've used it on and is difficult for my 15 month old to pull up--though he can if he really wants to.I wish I could throw it in the dishwasher, but I understand that this just won't work with this great material.Also, don't cut on it.I made that mistake and easily cut the mat.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.He runs his hand over it, feeling all of the textures.baby food is expensive, being able to make instant baby food from your dinner plate is awesome.especially for restaurants....just wish I had a bag to put it in when its dirty.Ziplock is useful but not reuseable.It grinds foor well with a little effort, been very happy with results on beef, chicken, brocolli, noodles, appricots.This is an affordable piece to add to your baby arsenol.After spending nearly an hour trying to get roasted sweet potato and roasted carrots smooth enough for my baby using a spoon and strainer and a food processor, I decided to give this mill a try.It's worked out very well for me so far.I've used it for pears, avocado and roasted red peppers (those were a little harder).I had to put those things in the blender to puree them further.Overall, I think it was worth the money.You can even put it in a baggy and take it along.Used this lock for the sliding doors on our entertainment center.I have two of these installed on sliding cabinet doors.The doors are wood with a glossy melamine coating, and the locks have stayed securely stuck for over a year.They are simple for an adult to use - use thumb and finger to push both tabs down at the same time, then slide door open.As long as there is 1/8" or so of clearance between the doors, they will slide freely with the lock compressed between them.Upon closing the doors, the lock's wings snap out again, and the doors are automatically locked - easy!He could easily apply the pressure necessary to press the wing down, but to maintain that pressure on both wings while simultaneously opening the door is a tall order for a toddler.On the flip side, while investigating the lock one day, he pulled down hard on the top wing, and it snapped right off.He went right over to our other cabinet, and snapped the top wing off the lock on that one.He hasn't yet tried to break off the bottom wings, and I believe that would be more difficult to do, but I docked this product a star for the easily-broken plastic.It was fully effective until age 23 months, I haven't found any alternatives that are as convenient as this, and for the time being, it remains effective even with one broken wing, so it still gets four stars.We've tried a couple of toilet locks and this one has worked the best so far.It is easy to use as well and stay high above the toilet away from any splashing or other "unpleasantness".This has worked very well for us and is well worth the investment to avoid toys, books and all sorts of other things going down the toilet.I use this all the time when I store my milk in the refrigerator.My son is finally at an age where toys really interest him.He tries to reach for anything that grabs his attention.The only drawback was that, while soaking in water, some of these toys got water in them.I had to get a blowdryer to dry the water (and dampness) out.My 14 months old likes them very much, and I think he will play more and more with them!I got these for my son when he turned 12 months on the basis of the very positive reviews here.At first, I regretted the choice, seeing that my son didn't take to the cars right away.Then, at about 14 or 15 months, he really got into them.The cranking sound intrigued him and like most boys, he fell in love with all cars, buses, and trucks.He is now 20 months and still enjoys playing with the cars, but he hasn't yet figured out that you must face each car forward in order to get it to move forward quickly with the cranking motion (as opposed to just pushing it).He loves to make the cranking sound himself, but he often does it with the car turned backwards.I used to spend a bit of time trying to show him how to do this and then gave up, but I will tackle this challenge again with him and see what happens.Perhaps only my child has this problem with the cars, but he doesn't have any developmental delays, as far as his doctor can determine!I agree with other reviewers that the cars are a little expensive for what they are, but they are of decent size and seem sturdy.Of course, if your child loves the cars and spends a lot of time with them, you will not mind the extra $10!These little cars are so cute!Easy for the little one to figure out - just pull the car backwards and they zip across the floor (my son loves when they crash into something and I say "boom!").A good toy to take along on an outing or trip.For some crazy reason the pink one in not removable so the washing instructions state to simply spot clean...gross!I sent this one back and found another one that is removable/Machine washable.This pillow really helps when breast feeding and provides a lot of support to both me and the baby.The only thing is it slips out of place quite easily.This reminds me of the pregnancy pillow I used to sleep on -- same kind of feel and support.I bought it for my 5 week old baby who likes to be held a lot.She doesn't quite fit the harness but this does surround her very well and looks like she's being cuddled.It could be a 5-star product if only the cover was removeable -- already had a few spit ups but at least they wipe away pretty clean.I was hoping I could use this for my fussy baby to sleep in but the pillow comes w/a warning tag that states specifically to NOT let a baby sleep in this...***update***I have been using this for tummy time since my baby was 3 months old.I chose these for my first child because my close friend was using them with her daughter and they didn't seem to have any leak problems.Not difficult to figure out how to assemble or anything.It's usually at inconvienant times like in the middle of the grocery store or while they are filled with water in your diaper bag.Considering I found another brand that had a solid bottom that gave my son no issues, that was a serious PITA.I have no clue when he'll ever need the fast flow nipples.He's a big eater but at 7 mo whenever he tries the fast nipples (or I accidently put them on) he spills milk everywhere.I can't say I didn't get my use out of them but I won't buy these again.!If I would've known about this product earlier, I would've bought it when he was born!I purchases this for our baby who is arriving in February.I can't wait to see the tyke wear it!It is very soft.When we stopped swaddling, we transitioned our boys to sleep sacks.We use Halo cotton sleep sacks in warmer weather; fleece when it's cold.After trying the ring and the hand, we fell upon the teething blanket.It's soft and fuzzy and silky/satiny with 2 chewy corners.IT ROCKS!TERRIBLE!And the pleats make them very bulky in your bra.Plus, there is only one weak adhesive strip, so they slide all over the place.Bad bad bad.I got this as a baby shower gift and thought it seemed like a good idea since I didn't intend to buy jarred food.It is hard to put together, very hard to take apart, and a total pain to clean.The very few times I tried to use it I got so mad that I swore I'd never use it again.It turned out that I didn't really need to puree food for my baby anyways.Simply mashing in a bowl with a fork or cutting into very small pieces was completely sufficient.I'd recommend it.The bad: I need to stick a fork in one of the holes in order to take the top off.I need a dishwasher or veggie brush to clean the holes.The crank started wobbling after a few uses.It doesn't puree meat.good concept but very messy and hard to clean up.It is still in it's plastic wrap.The reason I am writing a review is because I did not have to use it.Just about everyone has a blender or food processor.Spend your money on something like more ice cube trays (to freeze your baby food) and pyrex containers (to store and heat up your babies food).Those of you pureeing meat in your food mill --- do we have the same product?????Mine has a plastic grate.I **barely** mashed up some cooked peas in this thing.I can't imagine getting meat through this!That "blade" is like a dull butter knife.It worked great with a ripe avocado, and that was about the end of that.You really need three hands to get this working - two to push down and stabilize at the same time (I have to press really really hard), and a third to turn the handle.When it's covered in a slick puree that's not easy.Also, the plastic stains easily.It's a great concept, but I would NOT buy this.I use it for my baby when traveling =)  very portable and no need of battery is a plus of course =pYou get what you pay for.Great product for those of us who want to feed our babies healthy, wholesome foods.I highly recommend this product to anyone.Can't say enough good things about this very valuable, easy to use, easy to clean, handy product.It helps that it has 2 different heights but I found it difficult to use by my bath tub - not because the stool is inefficient but because I have shower doors instead of a shower curtain.I do find that I use it when I sit down on a chair/couch as a foot stool.I haven't used it to store items in it yet because I don't want it to get heavy.Glad I bought it!We have a small place and this also adds some storage for soaps or toys.Getting a second car seat base is a good idea if you like to switch cars with your partner a lotI have a snugride 35 carseat.Now I have to return it and wait for the more expensive one to come.How hard is it to include in the product information that it excludes, or will only fit certain models?I WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PUMP.I'M A FIRST TIME MOM AND DIDN'T REALIZE THAT IN SOME CASES SPENDING THE EXTRA MONEY IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY WITH BABY SUPPLIES.IN THE HOSPITAL I WAS SUPPLIED WITH A MEDELA HARMONY PUMP TO USE AND WAS VERY HAPPY WITH IT, I THOUGHT THIS WOULD WORK THE SAME AT HOME.I WAS VERY WRONG!!!BY THE TIME WE ARRIVED HOME I WAS VERY ENGORGED AND DESPERATE.MY NEWBORN HAD LATCHING ON PROBLEMS AT FIRST SO AS SOON AS WE GOT HOME I ASSEMBLED THE PUMP AND SAT DOWN TO USE IT.NOTHING HAPPENED.I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING LETDOWN PROBLEMS SO I TRIED HAND EXPRESSING AND WAS SUPRISED TO FIND THAT I WAS SPRAYING MILK EVERYWHERE!THERE WAS JUST NOT ENOUGH POWER TO PULL OUT THE MILK.I WAS VERY UPSET ABOUT WASTING MY MONEY.LUCKILY THE HOSPITAL HAD SENT ME HOME WITH A MEDELA MANUAL PUMP AND THAT WORKED GREAT UNTIL I COULD FIND A DECENT RENTAL.PLEASE LISTEN TO THE LOW RATINGS ON THIS PUMP.I COULD'VE SPENT THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND PURCHASED A GOOD RECOMMENDED PUMP.This hamper is way more than I was expecting, I love it!It's big enough for babies clothes and strong.I recomend it.I had a hard time getting the hand print to stick with the double-sided tape & it kept falling in the frame.I was desperate for a quick solution & put some jewelry glue (the ONLY kind of glue I had) on the back of it, and it's been sitting in place ever since.I'm thinking of purchasing another one for the grandparents next!I just had leather installed in the seats of my car so I figured I should buy something to protect them from my baby's car seat.I decided to give this product a try since the Lionheart brand has been very good in my experience with it.If you own a small car, you might want to rethink this purchase, because this seat saver will definitely take space from the other seating spaces in your car...people would have to seat over part of it, no kidding.If it happens I'll update this review for sure.Bottom line is that it is a very decent product and does what it is supposed to do, which is protect the seating surface.I would recommend it.Despite installing the seat properly on top of the the protector pad (putting my knee in the carseat and tugging the LATCH straps very tightly), the carseat still slid around a LOT.We ended up removing the protector and reinstalling the carseat the same way (knee in seat, tugging hard), and the carseat didn't budge a bit.Our car has fabric, not leather seats, but the seats are contoured.I am so glad i bought this.I did not realize how bad car seats left marks on leather seats.I have never had any problem with it sliding and it matches the gray leather in my truck.i have 3. one for each car seat.it catches all the junk that my son drops or spills, even juice.it really protects the leather and is a must own if you let your kids eat and drink in your car.He is now 19 months old and it plays every night while he sleeps.It is very soothing and serves to dull noise coming from other rooms that might disturb him.There are tons of sound combinations, a volume control, and best of all, there is an adapter, so you need not spend a fortune in batteries.It travels well, so we never have to go without it.Now that I am pregnant again, I have a bought another for the new baby.I absolutely love this product.Five stars, without question.I've been using the sound sleeper for a month now and it's great!After fighting to get her to sleep during the day I didn't know what else to do.Then my husband and I were talking to each other next to her crib debating on how to get her to sleep (she was crying) and after about 5 minutes we realized that she had passed out!To try out my theory I downloaded some rain music (I knew she fell asleep great when it was raining) to put on my iPod and it did the trick.I immediately remembered this being on our registry and purchased it right away.The sound sleeper has been playing ever since!We use the rain/thunder combination but our DD also likes the ocean/thunder too.There are definitely other combinations to choose from, but those work for us.I know people have trouble with their babies waking up after the sound goes off so we keep it permanently on and since the sound sleeper plugs in(!!!)you don't have to worry about eating up batteries.The sound sleeper is definitely a must have for out LO.So to recap:Pros:1.Lots of combinations to choose from.4.Plugs in so you don't have to worry about eating up batteries!Cons:1.If I have to list at least one, you can hear it on the baby monitor.It doesn't bother me at all but it might be a down side to others.This sound machine bummed me out at first because it was so low.Once I started pushing super hard on the up volume it went to the desired level.I'm happy with it though because as long as I set it to the desired volume at night before bed it works great.We ended up chucking this last week and i wanted to be sure to warn others.It would say 100 when we thought she was slightly hot, so we'd get out hte 'freebie' from the hospital and it' would then say 98.4.Oh, since we were nervous we'd then get out another one and do the same thing and it would then say right around hte 98.4.Unfortuantely, this was not the first time it had done this to us.Save your money!We invested in the ear thermometer scan hospital grade from braun.you figure you'll need one thermometer per kid with this type, the ear one is for hte whole family.I bought this for my baby boy 4 years ago and the blanket/fitted sheet still look like new, even after all the washings.It's so adorable..I'm expecting a little girl now and if they had this in pink I would so get it for my baby girl, but sadly they don't!The quality of this sleeper is good.It's soft and has a cute design.The only problem is that it is HUGE.I ordered a Large based on the description (my baby girl is 11 months old).I think I could have fit 3 of her length-wise into the sleeper.My 11 month old is just about to grow out of it length-wise which is why I've been looking for something bigger.The weight of this fabric is great as it gets warmer outside.The only reason I gave this product a "4" is that the zipper isn't holding up as well as I would have hoped.This one is so cute and is super light.It's the favorite.We are on our third size of Halo sleep sacks and love them!My daughter can't wait to get into hers at night.This doesn't bother us because we prefer pampers.It is far more functional than using the disposable container wipes come in.We have 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.So worth the money!The warmer has worked great thus far.Overall, it has been a great purchase with VERY easy installation and use.A great product.I can't say anything as far as the functionality of the product, since it's for a friend and they're not due for another month, but this item looks really nice!They're really excited about it, it was on their baby registry and their friends who use it say it's great!We have a high need, fussy baby and this warmer gave him one less reason to cry!As soon as we got this the fussy diaper changes and wipe-downs were a thing of the past!It is a nice little way to spoil your little one's bottom!Everyone raved about this and said it was a must have.But I could have done without and feel functionally it could be better.Only thing I don't like is the sponge on the bottom that needs to be replaced every few months.Not a bad product to have as long as you have the counter space.Just don't forget to wet the stay fresh pad every week.It will turn brown and dry upBut it is truly terrible.I didn't even get to use it because the lid does not stay on!It keeps opening and the wipes start to dry out.Pointless, really.Just buy a different one.We got it when he was about 18 months so the chewing wasn't as big a problem.Great value as the price was low and he uses them almost every day.Makes spelling things tough.This is a great product.We've tried lots of sippy-cups for our 18 month old.This one is good for him and good for us.I would love to give this product 5 stars...Not one of them worked - this was the most expensive of the 3 and you can still push buttons through it!!I have now made my own guards out of clear dvd cases - works better than this junk!However, these turned out to my favorite.I've had the ones in the purple box and another cheap box from the store.I just ordered 2 packs.They are soft, the lanolin treatment does make a difference and they hold leaking quite well!These nipples worked great for my preemie.He was struggling with the Level 1 nipples - milk would come out the sides of his mouth and he was choking a lot.Dr. B's bottles really help my baby from getting gas or spitting up.My newborn was still having a little trouble with bottles using the level 1 nipples due to the milk coming out too quickly.I switched to the preemie nipples and haven't had a single problem since.She is a slow eater and with the stage one nipple the milk was constantly spilling out of the sides and bottom of her mouth.I couldn't find these preemie nipples in ANY of the local stores and I needed them right away.Now she has no problems.Shipped through low cost carrier "LASERSHIP" which is notorious for losing packages.....like this one.Never received product.My baby has been using this since she turned 6 months.She is now almost 8 months.I haven't tried any other nipples so I don't have anything to compare this to but all of the Dr. Brown's nipples have worked great so far!However, I'm sure this varies baby to baby!Especially for the price, you can't go wrong.Just enough sophisticated toy to keep my baby busy with it for long periods of time.Love it!The teether has 4 soft rubber sections, each with different textures.He enjoys chewing on the rubber sections and likes to throw it to hear rattle sounds.It may be more handy for a baby 8-12 months old.The figure is too big to fit in my babies hands and mouth.They become frustrated very easy and simply drop the teether.I bought this teether for my five-month old, but ended up returning it because it was not dishwasher-safe and can't be submerged in water to clean.I wanted to be able to do both, so this teether was not good for me.My 18-24 month old got fairly annoyed with this bath toy.The hoop is just a net, so the balls don't come out of the bottom.You have to reach back into the hoop to get the balls out.Also, the balls have small holes in them and take in water.First, this product does NOT ship APO/FPO through amazon, which it states it does.We had to order this from an external website in order to get it shipped.I don't understand why other places can ship this APO/FPO without a problem, but amazon won't.Second, we like that the co-sleeper fits into our bedroom and does great next to the bed.However, we had to make several adjustments for our fussy baby.Our first adjustment was to buy a different sheet.We got an Eddie Bauer padded sheet, which was suggested by another reviewer.Otherwise the 'mattress' is incredibly hard and our baby hates it.Our second adjustment was to level off the 'mattress' with some padding underneath.Since he's a tiny newborn, we will have to wait until he's bigger to use a sleep sack with.Although, in the end, he prefers to sleep in the Graco's pack 'n play 'napper' at the moment.He'll reluctantly sleep in the co-sleeper.The pros of this product are: size (fits in our bedroom), can place next to the bed, easy to move around - it's not heavy at all, and you don't have to bend over to pick the baby out of.We just needed to make some small adjustments to this product, and we're sure our baby will eventually get used to it as he grows, but right now it's not the best.I didn't have any smell issue.I agree with the other posters that if you want a box that will hold its shape and is easy to close, you should probably not get it, as big toys can definitely alter its shape and make it hard to close the lid.But if you want a nice box to just hold toys without worrying about your child getting fingers pinched or falling on a corner, it's a must-buy - plus we never really cared about a toy box we could close anyway, and it sure beats large plastic bins.I'm glad I didn't have to put layers of clothes on my newborn.This is very convenient.You also don't need to worry that the baby overheating in the winter clothes in the car.Just use your regular clothes with this Bundle me.Way too expensive in my opinion, but I couldn't find any nice alternative.Very happy with the product.Our daughter was in the NICU and before we left, she had to have a car seat challenge.When we brought in her car seat, we had the bundleme in it and we had to take it out as it was a safety hazard.Many infant carriers/car seat warranties will be voided if you are in a wreck and using a bundleme or other type of infant 'blanket' that goes between your child and the car seat.LOVE the Bundle Me products.So much warmer than competitors.They love to look at it and grab it (when I dangle it by hand).I like the pictures and the fact i can alternate the pictures.The only downfall is that it doesnt spin.I wish it would spin that way it would keep them entertained longer.They would stare at it and lose interest until i spin it and they would look again.I wish i would of invested into a different mobile that spins on its own.You can spend a lot more on a mobile, but this one's a better value.You won't use a mobile for very long so save your money for something else.Sometimes I'd tie a soft ribbon to the mobile, and the other end to his hand or foot, and he'd make the mobile move all by himself (while supervised of course).However... once I had it out and assembled, the pieces are so flimsy and there are flimsy 'small' parts.Yes, she couldn't reach it yet, but still-- It made me nervous.It's a shame, it is a great idea.he stares at this mobile, giggles, smiles and really enjoys it.It gives me 10 min.in the morning to shower and get ready which is much needed!I started out with just the black and whites and added the colored cards in recently.Baby's excited kicks shake it gently, which is great from a developmental perspective.Cons:~Very tricky to attach to a co-sleeper...a clap base would be handier.I SUPPOSE you could cut and paste your own images to pieces of hard plastic and fashion a mobile yourself, but for $20 it's worth saving your time and simply purchasing this mobile.Baby loves staring at it in the morning while I get ready.However, for the price I can get the same one off the website and it comes with more pieces then the one on Amazon.I bought this product when my baby was 4 weeks old thinking I could use it at birth.I thought I had wasted my money.Then, around 7 weeks she started really enjoying it.She is 10 weeks now and she will lay in her co-sleeper staring at the cards, smiling and talking to them.I bought the JL Childress crib mobile attachment clamp for $12.99.If you buy them together, shipping is free.I don't have a crib and wanted a great mobile but none were compatible with my arm's reach co-sleeper.I like this mobile but had a couple of problems with it.First, the attachment doesn't fit my crib so we ended up hanging it from the ceiling.So, if you can't do that, I would be hesitant to buy it as you may be wasting your money if the crib attachment doesn't fit your crib either.This has become one of my 2 month old daughter's favorite toy.The cards are plastic and reminds me a bit of plastic poker cards.I've found that if you fold the cards so they lay flat against each other and then wiggle/twist the area where they are attached they usually slide apart.nice mobile- my son only liked it for a few months so I cannot review it for longevity purposes.Nice pictures- they did hold his attention and the advanced ones made him smile.My friend has a newborn who stares at it for long periods of time and I passed it down to her.Maybe this is best for 0-3 months range.It was worth the money in my opinion.Unfortunately the designs on the cards and the horizontal position for some cards are the only great things about it.Only some of the cards are designed to be in the horizontal position.I had planned to swap cards between the vertical and horizontal positions to keep it interesting but this is not possible.The only change I can make is to turn over the cards in the horizontal position to reveal the design on the other side.The cards in the vertical position are not viewable from below (where the baby is).I will be looking into using some tape to place the vertical cards into a horizontal position.The method used to attach the vertical cards to the plastic arms and to the horizontal cards is rudimentary and thus a pain.The vertical cards have a small triangle cut out for placing the card on the knob at the end of the arm.It isn't easy to do when the mobile is already set up and hanging over the crib.Each horizontal card has a couple of slits (that look like cracks) in the center (one larger than the other, at right angles).A tab at the bottom of the vertical card needs to be pushed through the bigger slit and then shifted into the smaller slit.Again, this isn't easy to do, especially when the mobile is already set up and hanging over the crib.The design of the hanging parts limits the amount of circular motion.It will only turn approximately half a circle.It would be nice if it could handle more motion than that.Great designs on the cards but poor execution for a mobile.When my husband bought this product, I didnt think my son would be interested in it.So I didnt think this one would be of any interest either, since it was mostly black and white, did not move and did not play any music.Boy, was I wrong!My son became interested in this right from the beginning, about 2-3 weeks old.He would just lie in his crib and stare at it, almost as if he was hypnotized by it.Sometimes this would go on for a whole 20 minutes!I had time to eat and do a bunch of other chores as well.We even got him a second one for his changing table, sine he liked it so much.Now at 4 months old, he still likes to look at it, although it does not hold his attention as much as it used to before.He chats with it pretty much every night and every morning.And I am so glad I listened to her!I don't find this to be a problem, however, because I don't want my kid to touch it!A crib mobile should be out of reach of babies.I just use some care when changing the cards and have not had any problems with them tearing.At first he didn't seem to notice it, but after about a week, he started looking at it and following certain the cards.Early on, they are more interested in the black and white.- Attaches to anything.We have it on a ovular bassinet and there were no issues thereCons:-  The construction appears cheap because it's constructed of plactic, so if you want your nursury to be pretty, this might be a detractor.-  It doesn't automatically twirl, so you have to stand there and twirl it for the baby.However, it means we have to be actively involved and not use this as a way to entertain without being involved.I ordered two for my twins after test driving my sister's Phil & Ted's clip on chair.Regalo's is much clunkier, unattractive and cumbersome.It is harder to get the baby in and out of and more difficult to set up.This bag is ALOT larger than it seems in the picture.It fits comfortably across the side of my daughter's crib and I use it to put in small toys and what not for easy reach when we/ she needs them.It's not clear but the simpler ones are actually a checkered pattern, I guess you can see it if you look closely.All in all, a great idea and it serves its purpose very well.I would definitely recommend it for a nursery as a must have, where else can you put small toys for an easy reach?Maybe in the future, they will start including them in the crib bedding set like they do with the diaper stackers.We had a bath pillow that was fine when he was a newborn but my son hated that thing after he was old enough to support his own head and sit up.There is a release bar that you pull underneth to get it to release when your done.The seat spins around so that you can get all angles without having to take your baby out and the sides make it easy for him to hold himself up if he starts to lean (he hasn't quite mastered sitting up yet).But we closed the room door.The gate must have swung back towards his room door but with gate handle still up.I did not know that when the gate handle is up, it blocks his regular room door handle (it's a lever one).So I could not push down on the room door handle lever, it's like if a chair was under it.Luckily the gate has these small footholds which I remembered so I used a clothes hanger and stuck the hanger thru the gap under the room door and pushed the gate away from the door...phew we were able to get out.Now I just always make sure the gate handle is always in down position even if not locked closed.But it does the job I wanted it to do.It is blocking off my son's nursery doorway.The clear panel gets kinda gross from hand grease I guess since my son's always putting his hands in his mouth.But easier to clean than rails I would say.Handle is hard to open but that's a good thing for little curious minds.Same with the latches that allow the gate to extend.I screwed the hinge side in and pressure mount the other side.I'm not sure if I installed it wrong but the bottom bracket on the hinge side is not flush with the side of the doorway.The bracket is a little loose but the screws stay in place though.Gate only came with spacers for the top bracket and not the bottom.The screws are drilled as far as they can go in though so that is the only thing keeping that bracket in place.I like that it swings both ways.He pats his hands on it often and still stays in place so far.I installed it so that his real door can still close when not in use.When not in use, I just keep the gate open and close the door.Very stable once its set up.We needed a gate that did not rely strictly on tension mounts.These are painful to unpop, but after one or two tries, you'll get the hang of it.After that, use the included paper template for where you need to drill holes.Drill the holes 2 inches deep (you must go two inches or screwing in the screws will be hard to do even if you use your drill to screw them in).Pop the gate onto the hinges that you mount after drilling, drill/screw in the mounts on the opposing side, and you are done.Its really much less complicated than the multi-lingual directions lead you to believe.This has become our new favorite gate.Once you get over the fear or dislike of drilling into your banisters/handrails, it really does become the most functional, easy to secure gate you can buy in my opinion.We tried the metal tension mounted gates and they always seem to lose their grip and need to be re-adjusted all the time.They also place alot of stress on your railings and if your railings flex at all, maintaining the tension mount will be difficult.That is the major reason we chose this gate.Additionally, this gate swings open, giving you 100% of the width of your walkway to walk through, whereas most tension mount gates have a smaller opening to walk through after you mount the gate.This is the best gate we have used!We needed to move my 2 year old to a booster because she kept trying to tip over her high chair.We were already using her high chair at the table (with the tray off) for meals, but putting her in this booster seat in an actual dining room chair makes her seem so much older and she really loves it.Glad to be rid of the bulky high chair... until the next child  :)My mom also has this same booster (in an older model) and has used it for many, many years for all of her grandchildren.DON'T BUY THE BULKY HIGH CHAIR!!She was 4 months and 3 weeks old.I read some reviews, looked at the pictures submited and saw some 5 month old babies in this booster.Oh, I'm so happy I don't need to buy that HUMANGOUS expensive high chair.I put it on top of the dining table someties(in the middle).Easy to clean.Small enough to keep in the trunk or inbetween the back and front seats of the car.He likes it ok.He likes to sit on it when i place it on the floor, but my son whined after short period of sitting on this chair so I ordered Lipper International 516C High Chair, Cherry for $35 from amazon after testing it out in different restaurants (it's virtually in every restaurant)so using this instead.At 7month old my son figured out that he can pull out the different layers of the table and he started to do that everytime i sat him in itgreat space saver, easy to clean, my son enjoys sitting in it (7 mos old).Great product for the price!I really can't say enough great things about it & I recommend it to everyone with an infant.The fact that it folds up & has a carrying strap is very convenient.The snap on tray is pretty useless once they get old enough to pull it off (the tray underneath is great by itself), but it's nice that the cover snaps on when traveling to keep the tray clean.Now that he's no longer using the high chair, we use this as a full time booster seat pulled up to our kitchen table.This is definitely a product worth purchasing!I am very impressed with this booster seat!We transitioned to this one when our standard-issue high chair just became too cumbersome to position and clean.The traditional high chair was more padded but I gladly traded that for ease of clean-up.This little booster has everything I need:  adjustability all over the place and easy maintenance.The straps are durable and adjustable, the tray positioning is adjustable, and the chair height is adjustable to three different positions.I like the option of sticking the tray straight into the dishwasher for cleaning but I've never done that as it's so easy to clean just in the sink.Also, it comes with a cover for the removable tray.I imagine this can be used for preparing a meal for your little one and then sticking it in the fridge for the sitter, in addition to just keeping the surface clean.The tray does not extend out around the baby quite as much as a traditional high-chair but I don't see that as a problem.The legs are reinforced on the bottom with rubberized grips to hold onto the adult chair or surface.Honestly, I wish I would have put this seat on my baby registry instead of the big, bulky, and hard to clean otherone that I wound up selling anyway.We purchased this for a special baby who visits us a few times a week.This chair folds up small enough to store on a shelf where I keep large pots and is easy to strap to a chair for a quick meal of strained whatever.Said special baby loves to sit at the table with everyone, something a stand-alone highchair might not allow so easily.Clean-up from our special, but messy, baby guest is a breeze.I just take the chair and tray to the sink for a quick wipe/spray, although I could put the tray into the dishwasher.Five stars for sure!After reading some of the 800+ reviews, almost entirely in favor of this seat, we bought it for our then 3-month old, knowing it might be a little while before he could really sit up in it well.At first, he could sit in it for a few minutes before he'd start to list to one side.He can sit in it just fine.You can use the tray or slide the baby up to the table, which is what we usually do.The chair is super easy to clean and it'll be nice later on to have a portable high chair for him.I'm so glad we didn't spend a ton of money on a chair that wouldn't do anything more than what this one does so well...support your child in a safe place while they learn to eat.This booster seat just made my "must have" list for babies/toddlers!We recently purchased this booster seat to replace the Fisher-Price Rainforest Healthy Care High Chair, which we simply did NOT like.That seat was hard to clean, the tray was too large, and all around it was just a hassle (you can see that product for my full review if needed)This booster seat has everything I was looking for in an improvement.The tray is much smaller (easy clean up) and covers the base (again, easy clean up).The tray is at his tummy level, instead of up in his armpits, making it easy for him to handle his food.There is no fabric for food to get smooshed into (and he looks plenty comfy).We are so glad we listened to her.It's very well put together and was very well thought through.We keep it in the back of our trunk so that it's with us whenever we need it.It's very easy to clean up too.totally washable/wipeable.adjusts to any chair.we did not buy a traditional high chair, one because this one received so many great reviews, two, because i didn't want another item at the dinner table taking up too much space, and lastly, because i wanted something EASY to clean and many high chairs have the seats that you have to take off and throw in the laundry.as soon as my girl could sit up, we put her in this at the dinner table and it's been great ever since.Our apartment is very small, and the thought of spending money on a bulky high chair got me looking into booster seats.And I'm thrilled I didn't go for the high chair cause this is even better cause you can put it anywhere and take it everywhere with you!Plus it's a total space saver and you can't beat the price!We use it three times a day, every day.It is very easy to clean, with no nooks and our son loves sitting in it (and I need him to stay for a while after he eats, otherwise he will spit up).We only use the brown tray (haven't used the platter or lid).Have even brought it out on the deck as a little seat for baby since he doesn't entirely sit up on his own and isn't a bumbo fan!Well made, would buy again.I have an older model, but I have used it for over 7 years already!But believe me these come in so handy!I have used mine attached to a picnic table, attached to a park bench, on a beach chair, and I even attached it to a golf cart many times!It is small enough to go anywhere, and believe me it comes in so handy while staying at a hotel, at the beach, at grandmoms, or anywhere baby needs to go.I purchased this booster seat because I was tired of my daughter's highchair taking up so much room.Easy to set up, easy to clean, easy to take with you!Our 6 month old LOVES being more of a part of the "action" at the table and we don't need to use the nasty high chairs from the restaurants.Also love that you can adjust the height of the chair.My 2 year old great grandson was here the other day and it worked great for him as a highchair (strapped to one of our kitchen chairs).We chose this booster seat to use as our "high chair" for feedings based on the positive reviews it received on Amazon and a limited amount of space available in our dining area.It is a decent choice for us; however, there are a couple of difficulties we've experienced with this seat.The first problem is that, at times, the tray doesn't snap on easily.One side will snap easily, then the other side can be difficult.With a squirmy or fussy baby, this can be frustrating.Luckily, after multiple attempts with position changes, it snaps and is very secure.Also, being slightly above average in height (6' and 5'7) and owning a standard-sized kitchen table and chairs, the booster seat sits so low that we have to slouch to feed the baby, or build up the base to raise the height for comfort.Also, for those of you without a lot of space or who just don't want a huge high chair sitting around, the booster chair slides easily under our table (while secured to the chair) when not being used.(This is the positive side to the negative comment mentioned above.)Overall, a good product and value.He loves to sit w/ us at the table.room for him to grow in this).He loves the table too--makes him feel like he is sitting w/ us at the dinner table but also has his "special" chair.Very easy to attach to a chair too--we have one w/ a cushion and no problems.Very secure.We use it all the time when we're out.We also use it to feed him outside by just placing it on the ground.It's cheap, durable and easy to clean.Good quality product for your money.You cant go wrong with this seat.It attaches to a kitchen chair and is at exactly the right height for my very large five-month-old to sit at the table - although we prefer to use the tray, since it is easier to clean.This makes feeding a snap, and the seat fits in our sedan's trunk easily for road trips.It's not as adjustable as a high chair, particularly height-wise, but it will adjust for girth.This seat secures nicely, is easy to stow, is convenient for everything from dining halls to the home kitchen to great-grandma's house.I like that it can also be used as a booster.The tray is VERY easy to snap on and off (for an adult), and doesn't accidentally slip off when the child is in.We didn't even own a high chair for our baby, and I see no reason to spend the big bucks or give up the space required for high chairs.Plus, high chairs usually have cloth cushions which I do NOT understand one bit!Some seats are hard to snap the tray part on and off... we were going to buy a different seat but pulled it out of the box at the store to try the tray and it was SO hard to get on and off.We also tossed this chair in the car to take along if we were going to someone's house- it was very handy.This high chair does its job and is an inexpensive alternative to other high chairs with the stand.We switched nipples right away when our daughter was born because the milk was pouring out around her mouth.The Variable flow nipples are the ONLY nipples we've used since she was about 3 weeks old and now she's 5 months.She gets what she wants and we get very little mess.And it's great because they don't drip or spill like other nipples.You may not have to do this with your little one, we did because they both had alot of trouble sucking so this assisted them.Don't cut to far or it will rip.I also found that you have to buy new nipples every once in a while because they can split BUT it's worth it.I bought this nipple for using with thickened milk but it didn't work.We started with pumped milk and some formula when he was a few days old and he goes back and forth from bottle to breast with no issue at all.Loves to take it apart, play with the balls by shaking them or hitting them together.I can see this toy lasting a while, looking forward to when he figures out he can toss the ball back in the top for music and lights!Can't enjoy the pull apart peices, too big to hold, too hard to chew.Mirrors and colors on feet are small and not bright enough to catch interest.It's cute though.Although it's hard to co-sleep with this while breastfeeding, it's comes in handy when we travel or even go to someone's house.It is a bit short, my 2 month old already kicks her feet above the foot rest at the bottom, but it's still comfortable for her.I got this so I could nap with my newborn in the bed - there are a lot of tabs and folds that I am not sure how to use, but my biggest complaint is the toxic smell it emits - like plastic.This can't be good for me or baby.I hope it airs out soon, before baby outgrows this sleeper.I know these are cheap, but they didn't help with the horrible diaper odor.I would not recommend spending your money on these items.When I opened up our diaper pal there was still a bad smell.A year later, they are all in good shape and I'm happy with the purchase.They are little flannel clothes with brightly stitching on the edges.We use them morning and night for cleaning gums, washing face/hands/bum.I bleach them with each wash and the colored edging has barely faded.These have held up really well for us, so I'm not sure why my experience differs dramatically to some of the other reviewers.I'd buy them again.They are also cute.They do what they need to do when you wet them with a wipe solution (or just water).However, the serge on the edges... after a few weeks of washing, it frays.And, the unbleached ones seem less absorbent than the bleached ones, and tend to stain easier.(As another reviewer pointed out, you may want to price compare with the shipping added in, but these did the trick IMO)I can count on these to rinse almost completely clean before even putting them in the washing machine, which is really nice because the diaper pail doesn't get completely disgusting if it sits in there for a day or two before getting washed.I purchased this to use on the short sides of my son's DaVinci Emily crib.There's a fabric teething cover on the long side of the crib.I followed the directions exactly and the cover has held really well for the last 5 months.The edges are curling up a tiny bit, but overall this product has worked really well and my 13 month old son hasn't ever tried to peel it up to play with it.product didn't stick to the crib, making it useless.I would not suggest getting this product at all!I wish I had bought something before he got his little teeth marks on his crib....but I found this product by reviews and I do think its a great product.Im pretty sure they sell it by the whole crib.But for the price, it should be the whole crib.After I received this item, I read the box and it said something about how they cannot guarantee the item won't damage your crib finish.I would like this product if they could figure out an adhesive that won't ruin the finish.We used a tether to clip it to her bib, so it couldn't fall on the floor.I own both the Sassy teether and the Munchkin mesh teether and the Sassy is a much better product.First, the mesh part is removable so you can throw the handle, mesh bag, and cap in the top basket of your dishwasher and all of the parts get clean.The Munchkin's bag is attached to the handle.We like to put cut up oranges in the mesh bag and it is nearly impossible to get into the nooks and crannies of the Munchkin teether's bag where the bag meets the handle.Second, the mesh bag of the Sassy is bigger than the bag on the Munchkin.I can put about 2-3 cutie pieces in the Munchkin bag and over half a cutie in the Sassy bag.Third, you can buy extra bags for the Sassy.We own one Sassy handle and I have 2 or 3 mesh bags for it.You have to buy entire Munchkin teethers if you want multiple units.I also want to add that I think that these teethers are also great for toddlers.I have a 14 month old and we put foods that are choking hazards in the teether so he can enjoy the juice and taste with no risk.In response to some of the other reviews, generally speaking, yes mesh bags are difficult to clean.Your baby has been pushing food through mesh with his or her teeth or gums, so yes, food gets caught in the mesh.It's really easy to just run the bag under some hot water to clear the mesh, and then throw it in the dishwasher.I also have never had a problem with the bag staying put in the handle or breaking and my little guy is a very aggressive chewer.Lastly, I am giving the Sassy 4 stars because it touts that, if frozen, the handle will keep the fruit/goodies in the bag cold.I am unconvinced of this.I haven't noticed a difference in temperature when I have popped the bag in the freezer v. when I do not.If Sassy didn't tout this as a benefit, I would give this teether a 5.This thing is HUGE.....My daughter has a hard time with it.I gave it to her a few times, and gave up....Went to donation....What a waste of money.One thing its also heavy with the litte cold pack that is built into the handle.Another thing that kind of ticked me off is the picture has 2 of them on it, but you onlu get one....I know it's my fault for not paying attention, but still a little deceiving if you ask me.....My 7 month old took to it immediately.It is a little hard to clean the net because of the mashed up banana residue but it's better when I soak it in water first.I highly recommend this product for the 6-8 month old babies!The Prince Lionheart Complete Drying Station is our favorite by far, but possibly because it worked very well with Avent and BornFree bottles.We also tried the First Years Drying Rack and Munchkin Deluxe Drying rack, and there was no contest.The Prince Lionheart Complete Drying Station holds 8 bottles as well as other accessories on those same "projections" towards the back...The rack has places to dry the miscellaneous little parts of a breast pump accessories and can fit the breast pump shields with no problem.A side by side comparison of the three racks makes it no comparison!In that case, the thing did not work.It got warm enough to knock the chill off the milk, but didn't come close to making the bottle warm enough that my son would actually drink it.In that case, the thing works like a charm.It really does stink if you're trying to heat something that's cold.For that last reason, I love this thing.I use it at least weekly.But for an actually warmer... to make something warmER, it stinks.I haven't used this one but I like that it's really compact & fits my diaper bag.This is completely worthless to us.Save your money and go to Walmart and buy 2 of those clear 8 x 10 photo frames for 2 for $5.That's what we did in the end to protect our components (DVD player and receiver).We already set our LCD tv up higher out of reach, but the components were the problem.The venting mechanism designed to relieve the negative pressure makes it impossible to draw any liquid out unless the cup is tipped back far enough so that the liquid inside completely covers the underside of the lid.Returned the product.OK I guess I should have figured it out but I didn't think too hard about it...I wanted an extra SET of complete shields, the product description mentions keeping an extra SET at work, so my brain assumed this was a SET of shields.Thank goodness for Amazon Prime so I get free shipping; doesn't matter too much to me that I need to order another one, it will get here in 2 days with Prime.But BUYER BEWARE...this is just the listing for ONE SHIELD.Also...I found out when I tried to use them after I ordered a second one...this does not come with the little connecter that attaches the tubes to the shield, so if you need an extra set of everything, this won't help you.The set here is for one breast only -- it's the single piece that replaces the shield/connector assembly, plus the valve and the membrane -- all you need is a pump, collection bottle, and tubing to go with it.The only slightly negative aspect is that these are a little more difficult to get fully clean, because you can't remove the flange from the connector.I recommend rinsing them immediately after use if you're not going to wash them fully right away!These are a must have for your Medela breastpump.When you purchase your pump, buy an extra pack of these.They last a long time, however, when they do tear, you need a replacement, ASAP!The membranes are easy to lose or accidentally wash down the drain, but you can't pump without them.I learned that the hard way.I had a hard time figuring out how to review this.He still sleeps swaddled, so it still works for us for the time being.Unfortunately, the co-sleeper didn't serve the purpose I bought it for.When my son was a newborn, he would only sleep while being held, and I ordered this in a sleep-deprived haze hoping that it would help.While this does allow you to comfortably sleep and rest with a hand on your baby's back, count on your baby being one or two feet away from you while in the co-sleeper.For those facing similar struggles, I would see if your baby will nap while lying one foot away from you on a regular mattress before buying this.The co-sleeper didn't help us through my son's exhausting first couple of months.Of far more help wasThe Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longer.I bought it used for a few bucks -- money well spent.By the time my son was ready to sleep in this, he was done with the frequent night feedings and willing to sleep in his crib, so in that sense the co-sleeper ended up being superfluous.And when my son is crying because he wants to be held, he doesn't care that I'm just a foot away -- he wants to be held.The co-sleeper has, however, provided us with some extremely happy nights and mornings.For these reasons, I LOVE the co-sleeper.But is it a must-have, especially if you're on a budget?The joints on the pack 'n' play tend to stick, and we always end up needing to really wrestle with it.When we are done using this as a co-sleeper, I plan to leave it out permanently as a playpen in our living room -- we will only break it down occasionally, and the neutral colors will be nice.But a replacement for our super-portable Graco pack 'n' play, which sets up and breaks down in minutes?For us, definitely not.Two more quick notes.Pack 'n' play sheets fit the co-sleeper mattress just fine, in my opinion.We wanted to keep our son in our room with us for at least the first six months of his life, per AAP recommendations, and it was helpful to us to have this in our room instead of the big crib.The full-sized co-sleeper is truly the size of a pack 'n' play, which means it takes up a lot of room next to the bed, but that also provides plenty of room for the baby.My son is a big guy, and he will definitely outgrow this in terms of his mobility before he gets too heavy for it.I hope this review is helpful.The fact that the playpen assembly is so cumbersome is very limiting.If you have a newborn who is willing to sleep in it, this would be so helpful during those early months.I hope to use it for future babies and feel confident enough in the product that I will probably loan it to friends, because I think it will hold up really well.UPDATE: Just transitioned my 8.5-month-old son to a crib full-time, with little fanfare (knock on wood).I'm leaving up the co-sleeper in case there are tough nights in the very near future, but his gross motor skills are developed enough now that he needs to be in something with higher sides.When I first posted this review, I wrote that my son has finished the late-night feedings, making the co-sleeper feel superfluous.As it turns out, though, the co-sleeper has been extremely helpful for the last few weeks -- teething, his first cold, and ramping up solid foods have caused his night sleep to be disrupted, and having him nearby during these stages helped us both get more sleep.This bassinet really made our lives easier in those sleep-deprived first weeks that baby came home.I could reach over and soothe him, or feed him or change him, all without ever getting out of bed.Once he started sleeping through the night it became a stand-alone bassinet, and later, we lowered the bottom and he napped in it.Now that my son is older we use it as a play yard.I park him in it while I'm getting ready for work and we "talk" to each other.As a newborn, we used the bassinet feature against our bed as a cosleeper.It was also really nice to be able to see her at night right next to me, but not actually be in the bed with us.Once our baby could kneel, we used it as a crib, a few feet away from our bed.Now that she is sleeping in her own bedroom, we still have it set up as a crib for her friends when they visit.If you are looking for a true travel crib, the cosleeper is not quick to take apart and is heavy to transport.I wish I had gotten this from day 1.Instead, we spent the first couple of weeks using the basinette of the Pack N' Play, which we found started sagging after our 7-pound baby slept in it for a week.The basinette of the Arm's Reach is much, much sturdier and still supports our now 21-pound baby.There are also handy pockets on the side that can hold burp cloths, diapers, or whatever you may need in the middle of the night.We loved co-sleeping with our daughter and this product has contributed to our joy.She still fits in this co-sleeper.My parents have the mini co-sleeper and although she can still fit in it when we go to grandma's (our daughter is 16 pounds, 26 inches long now), I don't like using it because with her arms stretched out (like she always sleeps), they touch the sides and this wakes her up.Her arms could touch the sides of the other at around 4 months.Great product!BTW, you don't have to buy Arms Reach sheets to fit.The major baby retailers sell a brand that fits them and it saves you about $10!I loved the idea of a co sleeper.It was easy to get him in and out during the night for feedings.First, it did not fit through any doorway, that is fine I understand.They have trouble doing it as well, my dad and the babies dad.The next step was transforming it into a playpen.I again had the most difficult time.You can not however simply do one side, daddy had to do the whole thing in order to get it off.Unfortunately we have bent one of the bars in this process and it now looks funny.It wasn't all that stable to begin with, I actually used that to my advantage while rocking him in it sometimes.But it held weight just fine...we tested it...Basically I loved it as long as it didn't need adjusting.Which as you can see only happened a few times.A few frustrating times.I haven't delivered our baby yet so I can't comment on the use...This product was very easy to assemble.It took all of about 20 minutes from beginning to end.We have a pretty tall bed so the leg extensions were are must for us.I am very happy with the product overall.Excited to start using it =)My child doesn't like to sleep in it which and I think it's due to the cushion, because she has no problem sleeping on the couch or our bed.It was a little low so instead of buying the leg extensions, I built a wood platform which works great.I like the fact that it can store a lot of things on the sides.We've been using it for almost 3 weeks and will continue to have our baby try and sleep in it and we might revise our review later, but as of now, it's only ok.I've had this in my car a little over a year now (I use it with theBritax Advocate 65 CS Click & Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx).I found it was easy to position and has done a great job at keeping the fabric upholstery in my car from becoming badly creased by the weight of the car seat.I have a light color fabric and there has been no problem with dye bleeding onto my car.I think for the price, this is a great product and I'd recommend it.It's also handy because it has a little bag that you can use for a pacifer (makes it easy to locate a spare while driving).Its good for protecting the seat when he forgets and puts his feet on the seat or spills something.Only complaint I have is that the toy bag is pretty worthless.The elastic is giving out and he really can put anything in it because it sags and falls out.We've had it about 6 months now.Whatever dye is being used on these protectors ends up rubbing off on the upholstery.Your seat may be protected from wrinkles and creases but they'll end up discolored if you have a lighter color interior.There is definitely a lot of static, but the receivers seem very sensitive also.One of the receivers quit working after the first battery change and we had to exchange it - luckily still within 90 days.Bad thing about receivers - they will not take rechargeable batteries.So that adds to the overall cost.Based on all the reviews of other monitors, this one is still about as good as it gets for the price.They all seem to have static or will randomly beep.At least this one does not wake me up in the middle of the night - unless the baby is crying.I have been using mine for ten months and my son has enjoyed using the monitors as toys, so they have taken a fair beating.They go camping with us as well.My wife and I were looking for a monitor at the store Thursday night and this seemed like a reasonable buy.I guess at the price it is.But the static is so bad it is going back on Saturday.We may have to pay twice the price for something that sounds better... but we will.It's my fault for not checking the reviews on Amazon first.There are some things that would interest a baby such as rings to slide, a crinkle flower, and a magnetic hand.The ball also has a cute face that vibrates when you pull it out.It does have some flaws unfortunately.The ball is supposed to make sounds, but it only does so when it is thrown or hit very hard.The head is also very hard to pull out.Fun toy very color full seems durable but my grandson is 9 months old and lost interest right awayShe likes it now, but really just holds on to the pages right nowI ordered this basket because my 6 week old daughter does not like to sleep in her crib and I thought a basket like this would make her feel more secure.I sent it back to Amazon the next day.I do not recommend this basket for anyone.Bedding is kind of thin.I love this because i can take it anywhere and have somewhere for baby to sleep.I comes with me when i go clean homes and I love that I can set My baby anywhere without having to put it together like the pak n play that we have.I would recommend getting 2 sets of sheets for it.We have had several of this type of toy over the years by different companies: Infantino, Fisher-Price, and Tolo.This one is the best out of them because of it's bright colors and the interesting sound the cute bug balls make as they spin.The Tolo Pony Carousel is another choice if you want one that is quieter, but the sound never bothered us.today was the first day and [with the extension] i can sit in there with her [which keeps her from crying] and do my college homework [big text books and a laptop.]she also cant get out, obviously, so no chasing her.sometimes, i use it to help brace myself as i step over [i have a bad back, so its nice to have a brace.]its kinda difficult to change the shape, but i look at that as a plus and a safety feature: baby cant change its shape and possibly hurt herself.wit the extension she has just enough room to move around with me and my stuff in there as she would without the extension and without me and my stuff.without the extention, my dog [pointer, 40lbs] spent some time with my daughter [they love each other] in it together.they had room to move around each other without the dog stepping on toys or the baby, or the baby forcing the dog to move after crawling a lil.My 5 month old was an earlier crawler/cruiser.This gate does exactly what you need.It can gate your kids into a baby proofed area so that you can get things done around the house.Other good use?Gating off exercise equipment or tv area.But it's not easy to fold and unfold and is annoying to do twice a day (once to get out once to put away).My house isn't big enough to leave it out assembles unfortunately.It was really hard to set up in front of the TV, it took me a half an hour.If not, consider just baby proofing a whole room for your tot.This is nearly 100% plastic, but plenty sturdy for toddlers.(For me, the fact that it's plastic is a plus, since I know our daughter would probably get splinters from chewing a wooden playpen, or hurt herself falling into a metal one.The panels pivot and lock at various angles, but the hinges are very tight and you have to push them pretty hard before they "SNAP!!"Maybe after awhile they'll loosen up a bit.Also, to completely fold it up, you have to disconnect one of the hinges, which is pretty hard to do as well.But it's half the price of the metal and wooden ones on the market.Find it hard to open and close it though, takes a lot of pressure and I feel like I'm going to break it every time I do it.We plan on using this play yard for our new puppy.The non-skid pads the mfgr provides prevents it from slipping on tile.Sometimes the panels are hard to move (to change the angle).I checked many other websites and stores and this was the best deal.I requested that is show up on a Saturday but it arrived on Friday.If you do plan on using this for a pet and have hardwood or carpet, I'd suggest getting a sheet of cheap vinyl flooring from a hardware store and placing it under the pen.I like to open and close one of the panels so I can leave the "door" open for the dog when I'm home.My only complaint is that it's really designed for that - it's not easy to do and it takes a few times to get the hang of it.I bought this for my busy 6 month old and she spent many minutes playing with her toys while safely enclosed from hazards.She just started crawling and this is just enough room for her to get the exercise she needs.plus, i wanted to be able to sit with her and play with her while she could freely move around.with this extension, we have PLENTY of room for BOTH of us and her toys...my 50lb hound dog even joined us at one point!the playyard itself was enough for the two of us, but barely.i definitely recommend getting this extention with the playyard.i can see where it would also allow room for puppies to roam around and even have the mama dog there, too!It's never been dropped or abused and yet similar to another reviewer, our monitor is losing the sound more and more.It goes in and out when the volume knob is turned.WAY too high priced for this kind of thing to happen.I would expect this from a $50 monitor not one that costs nearly two hundred.We are so spoiled!This product has been a lifesaver... my baby was crying at nap time while I was cleaning up the kitchen and instead of letting it go I checked the camera and her leg was stuck in the crib rails!I may have let her cry for a only few minutes before going in to check on her!It's just nice to see her for reassurance.The only two downfalls I have is the handset whether plugged in or not picks up a good deal of static.Sometimes its the positioning, or the dog walks by, I roll over in bed, or someone walks in the baby's room...The other the cord from the camera dangles on the wall next to the crib- presenting a safety hazard for curious baby.None the less I don't have an issue seeing anyone's baby like other reviews.I did take their comments seriously and actually considered not buying this product.However,I'm in a location where I am probably the only person to own this video monitor and didn't think it would be a big issue as there are SO MANY more PROS to this product.Enjoy!It really is worth the money and can be used for years to come!We purchased this monitor last October because we wanted a video monitor for when we started sleep training our daughter.This monitor is perfect since it allows us to be able to see what's going on without actually walking in her room.We do have some interference from the home phone and our neighbors car alarm, but otherwise it works wonderful.The only downside we have encountered is the part of the charger that plugs into the device had trouble connecting.I called Summer Infant's customer service and they are sending out a replacement charger for free.I definitely recommend!Got this because a friend recommended a video monitor over an audio-only monitor.I love being able to see my little one whenever I hear him stir, without going to his room and trying to be super-quiet, especially at night when you can't see him without a light of some sort when you go into his room.Whenever we have company while he's napping, they all get a kick out of being able to see him sleeping.If either the microwave, cell phone or portable telephone is in use, the audio becomes static-y and the video gets snowy.I even am able to see someone else's child if I switch from my chosen Channel A to Channel B!I must confess, however, that I live between two major metro areas with multiple governmental agencies and airports, so I'm sure that doesn't help.Regardless, I highly recommend that parents have a video monitor.Forget the shampoo and soap, this is the way to go!!!!!!!No rash whatsoever.It also smells SO good!The light, sweet scent stays in his hair for a full 24 hours.A little goes a long way with this product, and lasts for months, (even though I bathe my son every night.)I love it, and plan to use this product on my son, (and my next child!)for a very long time!We use these once or twice a day for a few days and it clears right up.We use mostly natural and unscented items and the smell doesn't bother us.These are definitely large enough to cut in half for a face & hand wash.  A diaper-bag must have!*** update *** The little one has out grown the bassinet.We now have broken spindles.I can only assume they use wood that has not been fully cured.ugly screws & screw holes.2.at some point the spindles are very likely to develop cracks.3.The crease lines in the fabric are hard to remove.(from being folded in the box.)4.the legs are a bit shaky.Don't move it around with your baby in it.Pros1.price point.2.looks good(after you do a few finishing touches) = Paint the holes the crews go in.I painted the screws as well.*dipped the heads in phosphoric acid then sprayed them with Krylon spray paint.Push the screws in the foam that came in the box.This make it easy to just paint the heads.*** Original review bellow ***Huge deal breaker.It no longer represents current product correctly.When they assembled these in house they used white screws.This is no longer the case.The smaller one are secure, but use no hardware attachment.(no screws) The screws are a metal alloy.The new look is "UGLY" / "VERY cheap" looking.When I called Badger Basket (1-800-236-1310) with concerns about the misrepresentation of the product by the pictures I was told "they are old.You can not paint the screw because the may chip / peel and pose a health risk to the child.I will tell (management) about the pictures.The only thing I can do is send you a white marker, but I do not know if they are toxic or not.The customer service representative asked for my phone number so she could consult the manager on what they could do.I received the call back within an hours time.The screws are a metal alloy that have a varied yellowish golden tone.The screws are counter sunk and the bassinet is only to be used till the baby starts to roll over.In my opinion not coating the screws to match the bassinet is a cost saving issue not a safety issue.Unboxing:- The unit is fairly well packed, but should have some added padding at the perimeter of the box.Corners are padded but the middle sides are not.- The inside edge looked as though the paint was damaged, but this turned out to be adhesive residue.My version is "ElegElite_6.0_0110TG" although version "830v2.0" looks to have a sturdier base.*We are still pending assembly/Looking for screws with a white head.- The assembly instructions clearly state that disassembly of the base unit may affect the stability and safety of the reassembled product.It assembles with screws.The unit does not fit through doorways.They are telling us to use it then throw it away as reassembly for future use is not safe.-/+ Mostly friendly customer service.Real live person./ Unable, willing, dismissive with regards to misrepresentation of product by advertised photographs.Some clearly show no screws other show colored screws.-/+ the white bassinet wood is painted MDF.+ The fabric is beautiful.+ The skirt attaches easily via pre-attached Velcro.= very nice.+ The round bassinet portion is pre-assembled.You only need to assemble the base and attach the fabric portions.+ The price is fair for product quality.*except for the ugly top screws*+ Easy to read the directions and understand the diagrams.I had no trouble assembling it even though I was 7 months pregnant at that time.I read through all the instructions and put the entire bassinet together within 2 hours.I did get my husband to tighten up the screws at the bottom to make sure that everything was secure.The bedding set that came with it was surprisingly well made.Also, be advised that the round "mattress" that comes with it is a very thin one-inch foam.The bassinet also comes with replacement dowels for the basket in case you need them.The area at the bottom of the bassinet can be used to store very light items.To solve this I use a bin that is slightly larger than the frame and lets it sit on top.I stash baby burp cloths and blankies in the bin which is very useful.Overall, a great buy!These bags are nice in concept but fail in reality.Yes, you can pump into them, but the top will basically be open so unless you're really careful, they are easy to spill.I now just pump into bottles and pour the bottles into the bags.The zip-top seal is very hard to close tight, you'll think it's sealed but it's not, or else it pops open after you close it.The first several times I pumped, I thought I was getting a lot more than I was...imagine my frustration when I poured the bags into a bottle and discovered I only had about 2/3 of what I thought I did.I'm going to try the Lansinoh ones next...these are not worth the price.Although wasteful to be using so much plastic, these bags are very convenient to pump into while at work.Unfilled they take up almost no space, and I can easily fit 6 very full bags plus two ice packs in my Medela cooler.Other reviewers seem to have problems with the bags not sealing properly.This happened to me only once.Since then I have double checked the zipper seal after locking it, and then I turn the bag upside down to check for spillage.I haven't had a problem since.I've used a lot of the frozen milk already and have had no leakage problems.Its a thick ziplock so it doesn't leak, just press hard and there's not a problem sealing it.I've never had an issue.The Lansinoh bag is cute because it says "My Mommy's Milk," but all the reviews about them leaking scared me.This stuff is liquid gold and I will only trust my milk in Medela bags.I was a little apprehensive when I saw reviews saying these bags didn't work properly.They'll come in so handy when I'm traveling so I can pump and store right away without having to transfer the milk afterwards.This booster is exactly what we needed.It worked so perfectly that we bought another for her chair at the dinner table at home.The color is inoffensive, the price is right, the seat is easily wipeable.Much easier to clean than her First Years newborn-to-toddler reclining booster, which this replaced.I like the way this seat is wide so my son doesn't feel to constricted and has a little room to move.I also like the way it sticks to the seat.The only reason for the 4 star rating is that it is very hard to clean.Even though I scrub it the bottom textured part still looks grubby.This has to be the most stable boosterseat for kids.Compared to other hard plastic, it is the best.My husband (who is in NO way mechanically inclined)put it together in about an hour and half and said it was pretty easy.This was a gift for my girlfriend's daughter's baptism.I had a hard time finding an original and appropriate baptism gift.The bracelet fit her daughter and looked adorable.Generally I am a back sleeper and so had to adjust to sleeping on my side.Early in my pregnancy I had a hard time sleeping because my lower hip would hurt so much it would wake me up.So I got this pillow.It helped me prop myself so I felt like I was on my back and helped support my lower hip so it didn't hurt.Now, later in my pregnancy it helps support not just my back and hips but also supports my enormous belly!I will say that all of the reviews suggesting that your partner will have very little room on the bed are correct.My partner has been very patient these last 9 months.I initially did not want to buy one of these pillows because I thought they were sort of silly.Boy was I wrong!The pillow is firm enough that it doesn't go flat when you're all wrapped around it.I also like that the cover comes off for washing (although it is white, which is kind of a bummer).I sleep in a queen sized bed, but anything smaller would probably be too small.I am currently 26 weeks pregnant with twins, but have been having trouble sleeping since about 10 weeks.Recently I had to stay in the hospital for about 10 days.During that time, my hip pain disappeared, I thought it was because I propped pillows against all of the bed rails so my body was more supported instead of putting so much pressure on my hips.When I got home I ordered this lifesaver, because it looked like it could mimic the support the bed rails offered.It gives support in all of the right places!If it gets to be something I can't deal with I will probably just cut the pillow and sew in a little velcro to relieve the tension.Overall- a great product.I thought this would be a great solution to my comfort issues I've been having in pregnancy but I was way wrong.The cover is not soft & the pillow itself is too stiff to mold to your liking.Also, the head part is too bulky to use with your own pillow but too flat by itself.Altogether the pillow was wrong wrong wrong.I only gave it 2 stars because Amazon's shipping/cost was awesome as usual.I bought this for my wife who is 3 months pregnant.She was having trouble getting comfortable in bed and was not sleeping.Very good value for the money, and the sleep is priceless.It was too thin and when she wanted to move to her other side it required her to pull up the pillow and reset it.I was worried it would be too short (the ad has what looks like a short lady) but that was not the case.It was MUCH thicker and it made my wife much more comfortable, especially when she needed to flip over.The only drawback was it didnt come with a soft slip cover.I guess you have to buy that separately.We decided to skip it for now.You cant go wrong with this.FrankThe reason I bought this pillow is because I switch sides and roll around a lot at night and it's the same on both sides.Adjusting yourself at night is easy because you don't have to fully wake up to adjust your pillows to remain comfortable.The cover is a pain to get on and off and, like other reviewers, I've cut the end of older pillow cases and put that around this pillow so it's much easier to clean!It bothers me a lot when I'm sleeping because I like to put my arm under the pillow while sleeping and I couldn't do that comfortably.I now have moved down lower on the pillow and put one of my pillows where the seam is so it doesn't bother me anymore!Overall, this pillow is great and has made those already-hard-to-fall-asleep-and-stay-asleep nights a little more bearable!But the filling really doesnt hold up well at all, and after just a couple months it gets pretty flattened especially as your belly grows.I'm at the end of my pregnancy now, and I really wish it still had the filling like when I got it because now is when my back is hurting the worst.I dont want to buy another pillow at this point, so I am jsut toughing it out....It is a BIG pillow but I put the back half of it on the very edge of the bed so it still only took up my half of the bed.If over time I find anything different out I will let you know but so far this is a must have!UPDATE~ 2/12/11I am still in love with this pillow.The seam in the neck area can hurt your neck/shoulder sometimes.I have put a pillow on the head area of this pillow and it gives me a little more head support and then I'm not on the seam.We recently had to go to a hotel for the night and I was SO sorry I didn't have this pillow with me.I slept without it the other night and woke up so sore and kept waking up in the middle of the night.I am 27 weeks pregnant and most nights I only wake up once if at all.I can't believe I can sleep thought the night still.The seam in the neck area doesn't bother me at all anymore.I was getting so frustrated but did finally get it back on.I tried to sleep on it and the fabric on the inside seam cut into my neck so much that I couldn't use it.I even tried to cut the fabric at the inside corners, but it still cut into my neck.Leachco needs to move the seam to the outside, use a softer fabric, and address the chemical odor of this product.When I first got this pillow I wasn't ecstatic about it, it was okay.The seams at the top sorta bothered my arms/shoulders.I have no back pain with it and sleep through the night so well!I got this pillow not long after I found out I was pregnant.I am normally a belly sleeper.So as soon as my baby began to grow I became restless at night.I found it so hard to sleep.Then by 20 weeks doctors will tell you that you must sleep on one side or the other... Yikes!I didnt sleep for weeks.I found this pillow and thought that it looked like it could help keep me from rolling on to my back in my sleep.I really cant sleep without it.It contours in just the right places.I would tell every mother who is expecting to get one of these totall worth the money!I was a little hesitant to spend so much on a pillow that I couldn't first try out.I wish that I'd discovered this pillow years ago--it's helped with my ongoing back pain.It's not too flat nor too fluffy--it's truly perfect.I take it with me on road trips because I really can't sleep without it.I only wish there was a way to cram it in my suitcase on flights.I am currently pregnant with my 5th child.In all of my previous pregnancies, I have just stuffed pillows all around and "made do".My hips were always hurting and I didn't get great sleep at the end of the pregnancy.I had seen these back n  belly pillows, but I just couldn't spend the money on it.Finally with Baby #5, my husband said, just buy the pillow.Boy am I glad I listened to him!I have no pain or discomfort when I sleep and I am now in my 8th month of pregnancy.If you are like me and debating spending the money on it, DO IT!I am currently 19 weeks pregnant and I got this pillow a couple weeks ago.The main problem I have with sleeping is that my hips are killing me from constantly laying on my side.If hip pain is your problem this pillow is not the answer.I don't know if anything is the answer as I just want to lay on my back but have been told I can't by my doctor.The pillow is gigantic!I mean it is really big.We have a queen size bed and my poor husband is stuck on the edge because this pillow takes up so much room.If you have a king size bed the size of the pillow should be no problem.I don't understand the reviews that say it's not long enough.I'm 5'8" and the pillow is plenty long for me.I can't imagine if this thing was any bigger.When I first go to bed I find it very comfortable if I can situate it so that it's supporting my back and I can hug the front of it.If I had to buy it again I probably would not but if I had a king size bed and did not have the problem with hip pain it would be a lot better.As a tummy sleeper I needed a body pillow to help keep me on my side & support my hips & growing tummy.At 1st I got the snoogle by the same maker as this pillow.I returned it the next day.The only thing that it had going for it was it's length...I got the back n belly pillow when I was around 24 wks pregnant.It keeps me on my side & I don't have to worry about waking up & taking it with me when I roll from side to side.The only down side & the reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is because that I'm 5'7 and it's not quite as long as the snoogle so my whole leg isn't supported, just my thighs & knees & part of my lower leg.Another thing is the pillow cover it comes with.It's not fitted froperly & is pulled tight at the top on the inside where it's rounded & it tends to cut into my neck.(Maybe a new pillow case would fix that problem.)**Update** I'm 5 wks pregnant (8/10/12) and wish I would have stood my ground when my husband wanted to throw my body pillow away.Now I HAVE to buy another.I WILL be buying this one over again.Maybe I can find a used one for cheaper & just get a cover ....I also forgot to mention before that the pillow is fairly large as others have stated, but I have a Ca King bed so it only takes up half of the bed :)This is the first toy that my daughter actually grasped in her hand (hence the high educational rating).I think that was approaching 3 mo?Can't quite remember.By 4 mo, she had discovered that she could make the little worm click.The toy is a worm made of a bunch of wooden beads and disks strung along a nylon-coated red elastic (much like a hair elastic).It's stretchy enough for a baby to pull on, and tight enough that it all goes back together when you let go, but not so tight as to risk pinching fingers.I have it hanging from her car seat handle bar (which, by the way, is totally against the rules, so you shouldn't do it...I'm just a bad mom that way) and it makes my daughter really happy when we go out with the stroller wheels.She also appears to love the texture on her gums, because she chews and slobbers on the ring all the time.This is definitely a favorite toy and the premium price is totally worth it to me because it is non-toxic and very high in quality.A lovely and well-made toy, yes, but not safe for babies who like to swing/rattle/shake things (which I assume is every baby).The design--long and wooden--makes it especially dangerous.I can't believe they're marketing this as a baby rattle!Great toy to keep in the diaper bag, attach to the car seat, everything!Overall great infant toy!When our LO realized he could grasp, he pulled at Max's ring and entertained himself for quite a while.Now that our LO is pulling on toys with both hands, he loves stretching Max more than ever.He starts looking for it as soon as I put him in his car seat.It took a while for him to take to it, we've had Max for about 2 months and the last few weeks my son has really preferred him over almost all his other toys.It is a great durable and safe toy, we love it!I think the only toy he loves better is "Gnon".This should not be marketed as a rattle for babies.We were impressed with the workmanship when we got this toy but as soon as our baby started playing with it--shaking it and whipping it around--we realized how dangerous it is (for her and for anyone nearby).A few thunks on the head and slaps on the hand later, this toy is now retired to the bottom of a drawer somewhere.... Not for babies!My hubby thought it was dumb - just a ring.But my kid proved him wrong - one of his favorite infant toys!!!!!!!HABA is a trusted brand in our house.This was the first toy that my baby was able to hold.I put it in her hand, and she was able to shake it.The toy is easy to stick in my diaper bag.What I love about the toy is the nice, soft rattle sound.It's really pleasant and not annoying like other toys.When the baby started teething, she enjoyed putting it in her mouth, and I was glad it is made of wood and safe dyes.I only wish she played with it more.Although she always takes it from me when I offer it, the ring doesn't hold her attention for long.For the price and the two minutes she will look at this toy, I'm not sure it is worth buying.The only portable toy that has ever been able to keep her attention is chewing on the rubber Sophie giraffe.A month and a half later he still goes for this ring and chews on it, shakes it and tries to pull it apart with both hands (one on each side pulling outward).I love the quality of this toy.My baby boy starting playing with this when he was about 5 months old, he really likes it a lot.That being said he likes his other 3$ rattle just as much, but I like this one a lot better.Yes, my baby didn't like it, he prefers more Sassy Talk & Fold Phone and Sophie the teether.However my son has had it for 5 months and has shown no interest at all.I was really anxious to purchase this toy since it had so many good reviews.However my son has had it for 2 months and has shown minimal interest in it.He'll hold it for a max of 10 seconds before either throwing it or just dropping it to grab something else, even from the first time he saw it.I purchased it mainly for teething purposes and thought it would also be a good rattle that wouldn't drive me crazy with a loud jingle.I will say that it is very well-made, a smooth, nicely finished wood with natural-looking but bright paint.This toy would last through multiple children.I bought this thinking it would be great for our 4 month old to bang around and chew on since she is teething early.But as a teether its a little too thick.Very durable, colorful toy that will last forever...just serving a different purpose than what i originally intended.I recently purchased 4 Haba toys for my 9 month old.He seemed interested in Ballino the first day, but hasn't spent much time with it since.His favorite is Trix which he plays with for a long time, taking it around the house, banging it on furniture and, of course, chewing on it.He also really likes Flapsi because there are interesting things to look at, it makes a neat sound when he flaps it and he likes chewing on the head and tail.He doesn't spend much time at all with Haba's Triangle, but obviously every child will have different preferences.Right now he is mostly interested in inspecting EVERYTHING in the house which is why I purchased more toys!But I think I'm just going to have to let him explore awhile!I bought Haba's Ballino for my daughter sometime just before she turned one.As a huge fan of anything ball-like, I thought it would capture her fancy.The toy itself is essentially 6 wooden pieces strung together on a very thick rubber cord.Each piece is separated by a small wooden ball to give even spacing.I thought this aspect would pique my daughter's curiosity, but it did not.The first day she received it, she played with it a little, but it has been virtually untouched since then.I assumed perhaps she was too old for it, but having read the other reviews on Amazon, I don't think this was the case.It will probably last forever - or at least a few decades until the rubber cord dry rots.But if I had it to buy again, I would absolutely pass it up.There are far better toys out there with much more long lasting play value.In fact, Haba's plain wooden balls have received far more play time than this fancy and seemingly more interesting toy.These blocks were the beginning of my love affair with HABA products.This is by far one of my favorite toy purchases for her.These have not held his interest as long as most of his other toys.I'm hoping that he'll grow to like them better.It's such a well made toy.I just received this in the mail today for my six month old.He took to it right away and has played with it all day.It is easy for him to grab and put in his mouth, the little men are so cute and it makes a fun rattle sound when handled.The box also stated the product was made in Germany, i have had some HABA toys from China.I will update this review if i have any issues but so far very well worth the money vs. some breakable plastic toy made in China!This one little bee gives him hours of entertainment.I can see that maybe these toys would be too boring for older babies, but for a three month old they are perfect.I gave these bees to my baby when she was 3 month old, They are light enough for her to practice lifting, plus the bright color and rattle sounds keep her interested.I also love that these are teether toys although my baby didn't use them much.But at 7-8 month old, She will have nothing to do with them.It's not bad - it does what it does but if the pressure mount isn't strong enough, my 22lb son can climb onto it and pull backwards causing the gate to fall on top of him.definitely recommend!For the price you can't beat it!We have it in our doorwary leading to the garage.We like that it is low enough for us adults and older kids to step over.Because you adjust the width of the gate by sliding the two panels, it will fit your doorway much better than the metal gates with the extensions.The only reason I ended up returning it was because I had a little trouble stepping over it every time I wanted to walk through the doorway (I'm only 5'2") and I didn't want to be trying to step over this while carrying a baby, laundry, etc.I bought this gate for a wide opening to keep my toddler from going up the stairs.I had some anyways, so I didn't have to spend any extra money, but unless you're screwing the eye-hooks into solid wood, you need them.It's great that you can latch/unlatch the gate from either end, which makes quite easy to adapt to any opening and a snap to remove completely when you don't need it.It does flex a bit when it's pushed, leaned on by my daughter, but certainly not enough to break.The plastic piece across the top keeps it quite secure enough for any normal use and abuse.It's tall enough, that my baby will never be able to get over it before we are able to quit using it.The open/close latch is not as easy as some, but after you do it a time or two, it's pretty easy and anyone should be able to handle it with one hand, while any typical kid of the age this should be used for should not be strong/dexterous enough to handle it.For the money, it's what I expected.It swings open or the slats slide to the side to open.It sits on the floor...so if you have a toddler and are afraid of their standing on it and it being pulled out of the wall, it's not a concern.The danger is in them leaning on it with too much weight...it could collapse on baby if not supervised.The hinges are simply screws with hooks, so they have to be put into a stud or metal to stay-put.Love the affordability and ease of sliding the slats over to one side.Cheap.At first, these stuck on real well.But over time, they seem to be popping off all on their own.The cushions are great in and of themselves, but the double sided tape used to stick them down isn't.But I'm still happy with the purchase and will just stick them down better with better tape or glue.I have sensitive legs and have bumped into my low coffee table corners several times, and I know these have saved me months of recovery time.My husband and I purchased a Hopen bed from Ikea six months ago and he constantly bumped his shins against the bed corners.We have no kids or pets and our furniture is dark wood, so I wanted something functional and non-conspicious.The cusion on my side of the bed has stayed put for five months.The cushion on my husband's side routinely comes off.Again, there is no toddler running around peeling it off.My daughter can easily pull these off the table due to not enough tape being provided.You would think that the tape would be cheap enough to add some extra.Oh and she was doing this at 8 months old...I can't wait until she is stronger... they will all be gone.When we heard about this blanket, we were very excited.Our daughter loves to be swaddled, when we get it right - however, the blankets that we have (even the ones that the hospital used to swaddle her) were not very helpful for easy swaddling.It doesn't fit properly and she works herself loose despite the velcro - the velcro contact patches are very small - there should be a broader strip of velcro to attach to so it is more adjustable.She swims in it.Fleece - decent winter solution, but terrible in the summer.And terrible if you keep your house over 60 degrees.the response we got is that most babies behave that way, and it really is the small minority of babies that don't really like swaddling.Now that we know how to do it properly, we would agree.I love this product.First son tended to punch through the blanket, ruining my swaddle attempts.Converted to this product when he was about 8 weeks old and fell in love with it.Just had baby number two and this time I brought the swaddler to the hospital: so much easier!I'd seen this swaddleme before, but didn't think it was that good!It is soft and the baby looks cute too.I really like the idea and maybe it would have been better if I had gotten the bigger size.Anyway by the time my baby was 2 months old he was already to big for this.He weighted only 10 lbs, I just expected it to last longer.My only advice is unless you have a very tiny baby like less then 6 lbs when they are born just get the bigger size.It's super soft, and it very conveniently has a place for buckles to go through when strapping her in to the car seat.I read about how swaddling your baby too tight can give them hip problems, but you don't have to worry about that with these.I really wish Baby Bjorn would have started messing with products that used to be so good...It was completely round along the sides, without this weird S-shape, and it definitely caught more food.The newer models aren't as soft.The funky closure mechanism always gets my baby's hair caught in it (ouch!), and worst of all, the cut-out shape means food now ends up all around the bib, and not in the bib pocket where it should go.All my baby has to do is turn his head sideways to mess up.On the bright side, these bibs do wash really well.I've even stuck them in the dishwasher, and they came out just fine.So here's my plea to Baby Bjorn: RETURN YOUR OLD BIB STYLE BACK, PLEASE.Too bad they are WAY too small for my almost- 2 year old...I guess I'll save them for my newborn and hopefully they will live up to expectations.EDITED ONE YEAR LATER:I thought I'd make more use of these with my daughter, but they are just too tight around the neck.A waste of my $I only wish that I had learned about these bibs earlier.I came to expect bibs to do little more than save the shirt they covered.Other bibs with pockets captured little food that fell and were a pain to clean.These bibs really do rinse clean and are ready to use for the next feeding!This is one of the few products whose use actually made me so happy that I am taking precious nap time to extoll its virtues.Hurrah for Baby Bjorn bibs!!Feeding baby solids for the first times, I really needed to grow a third arm!If you are trying to hold a spoon and a little dish, you are missing one hand to help the bib stay in place!Fortunately, those bibs are molded plastic and stay in shape and in place.They are also very easy to wash, simply with a sponge.The material is nice and quite soft.Colors are bright and cute.The size and neck clasp fit well my 4 month old (26 inches) baby, with room to grow.The only part that needs improving is the way it attaches at the neck: my daughter's hair get caught in the plastic and she usually looks very unhappy when we first put the bib on.Afterwards, she relaxes and all is well.But if you have not tightened the clasp enough (which is hard if baby is looking down or has hair in the way), it's possible to get the front of the bib stuck at mouth level during the meal, which makes a huge mess and gets baby very uncomfortable...It's still a 5 star product as, for me, it's the only chance to keep my daughter's clothes somewhat clean!He pulled it and cried every time he wore it.They are very cute but were of no use for me.and cleans so easily.I am ordering more!After about a year and a half, they started to SMELL GROSS.I mean really gross.We washed them regularly, and hung them to air dry over the sink faucet, but they still developed mildew spots on them.So, we switched to the Baby Bjorn bibs and are very happy w/ them so far!Or, you can toss them in the dish washer (which is nicer than the laundry b/c I'd always forget to grab the bibs when I was doing the right load of laundry to add them to).*** They are a GOOD SIZE- This coming from a mom of a messy toddler boy!*** The BOTTOM POCKET WORKS- It actually catches the food/liquid spills!*** They DO NOT STINK OVER TIME- If you plan to use your bibs for a long while, this makes a big difference!!!*** EASIER TO AIR DRY- We had to hang our old bibs over our sink faucet to keep the pocket out while it dried (which evidently didn't do the trick well enough b/c it still got mildew!)With these I can just lay them beside the sink to dry b/c they don't fold up on themselves.I think these are the only way to go if you have a messy eater!I love this soap.Not at all powdery (I know some people really dig that smell for their babies but not me).And, it lasts forever!I've been using the same big bottle and it is more than half full.It makes small bubbles which he likes to play with as well.This sorter has shapes that are a precise fit making it more difficult to line up with their respective holes.When you push down on the trunk the shapes are supposed to empty out but they sometimes get stuck.A fun concept but frustrating for my 11 month old.This is supposed to be an "activity" triangle, but it really only has one activity on it.That is spinning.You spin the mirror and some shapes.The only other thing you can do is rattle it, but it is too cumbersome for a baby to pick it up for that.I didn't like this toy at all and my child thought it was boring as well.So far, this hasn't been the case.The toy itself is bright, cheerful, and very very durable.I also like the fact that it doesn't need batteries.However, apart from a few things to spin, and a few shapes to fiddle with, there really isn't anything to sustain her interest.At first I was pleased to find a toy that wasn't at all noisy, but, given the lack of visual stimulation, I don't even think that that's a bonus.Also, the picture on Amazon of the toy shows a mirror at one end - the one I received had a boring spinner with a dog and a bone on one side, and a kind of "cage" design on the other.I think it's supposed to be an optical illusion when it's spun, but it doesn't work at all.Hopefully she'll find it more interesting as she gets older.I was really excited about this toy.But the little mirror on the top fell off while I was taking it out of the package!This kinda upset me.Imaging if it would of fell off while my baby was playing with it??other than that problem, my baby does enjoy this toy very much.It is very entertaining for her since there is so much to look at (other than the mirror that is).I would not recommend this to anyone because the mirror fell off so soon.This toy keeps my 8-month-old daughter entertained.I wish there were more toys of this variety.My daughter is almost 3 months and is finally starting to like to play with the toys.she likes the rings at the moment and the phone!This is a nice assortment of toys for baby, but some are better than others.He likes the fish too.He doesn't like the butterfly as much -- the open wing is a little too small and angled for him to grab easily.The phone is okay, but he doesn't find it as interesting and it is too hard for him to enjoy as a teether.The clown face mirror thing is nice for interactive play with the mirror side, but he doesn't usually pick it up to play with on his own, and the squeaker is hard to manipulate.This purchase was a waste of money for my.My now 3 month old new grandson is just learning to grab and hold onto things and loves all 5 of these toys when he comes to visit his Nana, which is practically daily.Thank You they're everything I expected and more.We believe this has saved her from falling countless times.She doesn't want them off, even though it makes climing in and out of bed more of a hassle for her.Excellent product at an excellent price!The sleep system looks pretty and matches any decor.I also like the mesh material that allows airflow and helping prevent SIDS.I very much like the large storage area underneath.Unfortunately, there are many aspects that are unnecessary.The change table is inconvenient to get to...if you have to move the bassinet off - where are you going to put it?Also, lowering the height makes the storage area and its ties look slouchy.So I never adjusted the height and thus could not use it as a cosleeper.My newborn also wasn't responsive to vibrations, the sounds, rocking, or the toys hanging from the canopy.She never even looked at the toys.My biggest complaint is the 1/4 inch pad they call a mattress.When I put my hand on it, I could feel the straps underneath (they came out of the middle), which we didnt use, and the three sections of the bassinet base (I guess which are supposed to incline).I got a 2-inch bassinet mattress, which helped to soften the bumps and uneaven bottom of the bassinet.To be honest, I would have preferred to have the baby sleeping next to me, especially during those exhausting frequent night feedings.But out of concern for her safety, using this bassinet wasn't too bad.The idea of this bassinet is great: just unhook the basket from the base and take your baby with you.Add the features of soothing sounds, nightlight, play seat, and changing table and it all just sounds too good to be true.I would have been better off buying a simpler, cheaper bassinet.Here are the problems:- It won't go low enough to line up with my bed, so I can't just look over in the middle of the night, I have to sit up to check up on baby.- The base is too wide to fit through doorways.But no, the base would get stuck in the doorway.- The rocker function, for me, was pointless.It was too cumbersome to switch from wheels or stable feet to rocker, so I never used the rocker.- It's too heavy and awkward to carry around.Much easier to simply take baby out and carry baby around in my arms.- The vibrator stopped working.It makes the mattress lumpy and weird.- The play seat function should have varied reclined positions.Or perhaps it just shouldn't have a play seat function.It has great music and vibration settings, a night light, and it is super cute.You can store little toys (or whatever) underneath.She will sleep in it, but some nights she is not having it.I would still recommend though because it is a great bassinet and should get a great review even though it is not my daughter's favorite.The only reason i gave four stars is because it is a little difficult to move, but not bad at all.Oh, and it only took about 30-60 minutes to set up.He would cry and cry even when we used the vibrating or music feature.Just put your baby in the crib don't waste extra money on a bassinet!We've been using this bassinet for 4 months now and plan to continue using for a few more at least.It sits beside my side of the bed.Based on the reviews I read here, I was worried about it being too hard and too thin, but it's really fine.No problems there.I did buy a very soft bassinet sheet and I use that over the sheet it came with.I wanted really soft sheets.They've gone from this tight tight space and then we throw them to sleep in this huge thing with all this space around them.My biggest complaint, and the reason this is getting 3 stars, is the footing of the bassinet.It sticks out A LOT.And it's awkward the way it sticks out.I would give it 4, so I split the difference.You can see it in the picture.I'd say an extra two full inches on each side and it has been tripped over many times, with the baby in the bassinet, or the baby in our arms.So, I wouldn't say it's a reason not to get this.I did extensive research, and found this to be the best one out there.I notice that many reviewers say that the covers stick in place and don't slide around; unfortunately, that hasn't been my experience.When they do work right, they're good-- big enough to cover where her hands hold on.I bought this product after reading the reviews and it really met the expectations.- It is pretty, so it makes potty training attractive outside home.She wanted to keep it or to leave it for someone else to use afterwards!- It is wide, so her little hands don't touch the toilet.When I used toilet paper, it is difficult to cover the sides.- It has two stickers to afix it, but I have to say, I was expecting something different.I thought the whole surface sticks, but it is only two parts that stick.But it is really sufficient, much better than what I expected, which would be difficult to manage in a hurry!Well, simple product that works.I plan on having these for a long time with me and my daughter!!We have this carrier as well as a Bjorn.Yes, it is that good.It's easy to put on and take off the crib, but still secure enough that your child can't do it.Just before buying these adjusters I'd picked up a pack made by Belkin.I found both to be adequate and can't say either has an edge.The Heininger actually stay attached to the belt between uses, which is a plus.When being used, these adjusters need to be slid to the side of a belt that is pulled tight and low across the lap...which is the proper way to use a belt anyway.If they aren't secured this way, they tend to excessively slide/move along the belt while in use if you happen to move much.The Belkin have a more in-use secure fit, but slip right off the belt when not in use do to their 'open on both sides' design.Also, if you like to wear your belt a little more loosely, these are the better option.Overall, I don't think there is an optimal product for adjusting seat belts out there to date, so this item is no better or worse than others.What can I say, the product simply works.I only use it on long trips but there is where it makes all the difference.This becomes an issue on long trips.This product has enabled me to stop constantly pushing the belt down and watching it ride right back up and then cutting into my neck.So, bottom line, if you have a seatbelt such as mine I wholeheartedly recommend this product.I'm 4'11" and drives a Prius and was sick of having the seat belt cutting into my neck everytime so I bought this little gadget.The instruction seems easy enough to figure out and installation was very simple with a simple snap, literally.It seems to also slip out once in a while too.The product has worked very well.I managed to get it on correctly the first time - more luck than anything else - and it has worked great.I subtracted one start because of the poor directions.I gave up and just went on intuition and prayers.I am short and curvy, so I have had some difficulty with seatbelt adjustment in the past and have tried several things to help it.I found the directions terse and confusing.After a few minutes studying the picture on the cardboard insert I finally figured out how to attach this strap adjuster correctly.The Commutemate strap adjuster pulls the strap away from my neck and towards the shoulder with welcome relief.These little gadgets are worth the money and negate one more reason for not wearing a seatbelt.Mrs. Spudman has her own set of seatbelt adjusters with similar design principle except that the back clip is already attached at one end.She likes that design better.I wanted this because I knew my 2 year old would try to sit in or play with anything this baby had.My Daughter loves to rock in it.The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 is because I see that it has stability issues.I noticed the newer rocker Fisher Price made seems thicker in the legs which may be more stable.It allowed her to be in the same room as all of us and be able to be at our level (on the floor) while we played games with her brother.He of course uses it as a rocking chair.They are 4 months old and have seemed to enjoy it.It gets 3 stars because there is no padding around the frame so if your baby kicks hard, a lot while seated, like mine do, they will learn the hard way that it hurts!The toys that come with it are way too heavy, too large and too up close.It is not adjustable.I just removed the whole toy bar as it looked annoying and disruptive to the babies.My babies love the recline position when having their milk.There is the vibration but my babies get irritated when it's on so we never use that feature.My baby girl loves the animal design on the top of the rocker.She strains her head to turn around and look at it.The Amazon price is the best!I have ordered another one as over all my need for it is greater than the flaws.The fact that the seat can grow with your child makes it well worth the money.I have dragged it, thrown it (with clothes in it), this thing is tough!It is very light weight, so when my daughter tips it she doesn't get hurt.I want the other design, too, so we can put toys in it.I must tell you, get so much use out of this little, versital mobile it's crazy.Oh and falling asleep to it, works like a charm in the department stores.I love this product, my little one HATES the carseat but this keeps him occupied.My son really likes this but it is so heavy that I won't put it on his car seat while driving.So I clip it on his play mat.My husband and I love this product.We love being able to hang it in her bassinet on the cover, so she can watch it.the batteroes also last a long time.We have been using it for a month now, at least a couple times a day and haven't had to change the batteries.We also love that we can take it wherever we want to go and we can keep her happy and amused.Again, we love this product!He sits underneath staring at it, talking to it and flailing around with general excitement.Its great for distracting him when I need a minute to get get his bottle ready or answer the phone.My baby loves this toy.She likes to roll it out and watch the pegs pop out.It is made of durable, sturdy wood and won't break.The picture on Amazon makes it look bigger than that.My brother and his family are a very "green" family!My nephew loved it and it passed my brother's "green" test!YAY!I recommend this gift!Comfy seat, baby enjoys the fish,water,music & vibration.Vibrations is quietOnly flaw is the toys come of to easily they seem to fall off everytime my son sits in the seat.He's been intrigued by the bubble noises from ~2wks old -- the first time we put him in and turned it on.At nearly 8wks, he enjoys watching the starfish spin; it can occupy him for several minutes.In addition, just having a seat to sit and watch Mommy is useful.However, currently, he is using the Bright Starts Automatic Bouncer more since it actually bounces, putting him to sleep.Unfortunately, the vibrating motor makes a high-pitched noise and, when we received the bouncer, the liquid level was so low that the fish did not move.We had thought we were unfortunate receiving a dud.I like that this bouncer has the vibrations switch to help soothe my baby to sleep and I like that it has a removable activities bar.However, when you turn on the bubbles/lights on the activity bar, the noise is incredibly loud.Also, there is no way to lower the noise level on it either.I found my baby didn't like it because it was so loud.I tried the snoogle pillow and it was very big (took up half the bed), caused me to be WAYYYYYY too hot, AND you can't use your own pillow with it.I bought it not knowing you can't use your own pillow with it and when i slept with it the first night, ended up kicking it out of my bed halfway through the night and returning to my old faithful boppy cuddle pillow.I wanted to buy something bigger because i heard a lot of people raving about it, but i ended up returning the big one and coming right on back to my favorite, faithful, and comfy boppy cuddle pillow.It is a perfect size, the only thing is, when your roll over from left to right or vice cersa, it takes all the covers from your poor hubby.also check out the boppy wedge.Both have removable and washable covers....I ordered this for my daughter who is pregnant with her first child.I'm guessing she'll use it even after pregnancy.It's really comfortable for that extra support during pregnancy.Some people use regular pillow also but I think this particular shape makes it real comfi for a good night sleep.Price is good too.I had to breast feed exclusively using the football hold for the first few months due to c-section; this pillow was my BEST option to do that.I spent weeks using other pillows in all shapes, but this pillow is perfectly curved and tapered to hug your hip.It saves my back and shoulders.Since it is slightly tapered, it angles your baby into your breast so they don't roll away if they turn their head, a problem I had with regular pillows.For traditional style feeding, in front of you on the lap, it works great too!I put my feet up on an ottoman or footrest to have a bit of elevation, place the large lobe of this pillow under the breast my daughter is going to eat from, and it angles her into the breast so she can be cozy and snug while nursing and I can have my hands free.This would be a great shower gift for any gal, especially if she is going for a c-section!Also not to hard yet not too soft.The wedge is nice if I am sitting on the couch for my back, but not that great for side sleeping.I have one on each side so it is easier to flip and have on on each side.It offers the support needed to allow the belly to feel supported, not strained, and relaxed.This little pillow is a life-saver!I didn't get it until late into my third trimester, but boy has it made sleep easier for me.Great for when your belly is just big enough that it kinda "hangs" a little unnaturally when you lie on your side.Seems like a silly little purchase, but trust me, it is NOT!I was previously using the Boppy cuddle pillow, which I received as a gift.I picked this up, around 34 weeks and have been sleeping much better.Before, I would end up sleeping with my stomach flat on my bed, so my back was twisted and would hurt throughout the day.Now I find it makes sleeping much easier.My pregnant wife uses a standard pillow as her "wedge".We have a queen size bed and between her extra 'size' and the extra pillow between us there wasn't much room on the bed left for me.This amazingly simple product helped with my back pain by supporting my belly throughout the nights, in addition to the LeachCo Snoogle.Even though it has its own cover, I put the Boppy in a fleece pillowcase anyway, which helps keep the wedge from sliding anywhere.It adds just the right amout of support where you need it.For the price, this is a good pillow.I bought mine at 8 weeks pregnant and found it useful until the end of my second trimester.It's great for belly support, putting behind your back, or between your legs.After 25 weeks, those bigger support pillows are really necessary.The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep.It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side.Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up.I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back.When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too.I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion.this pillow is ok.  it gives some support but it is really small and pretty thin.Before buying I recommend looking carefully at the dimensions (it's basically the size of a small throw pillow)She sat on it right away, however, she is timid and sensitive.As she was attempting to get off, the seat slid out from under her and fell off and she tipped back into the toilet.Good idea, the seat is the right sized for her but the inner ring that keeps it snug on toilets, needs to be longer and a little wider.She loves the design and the handles, but I have to be right there keeping it still in order for her to even THINK about sitting down now.It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat.When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him.He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new.I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it!Great sheet.I know that the label says not to put it in the dyer but I've always dried it on high heat.I've even washed it in hot water and thrown it in the dryer.There is just no way I would always remember to line dry it.I've always found putting the sheet on to be quite easy.You won't have to worry about it coming lose.It's not super soft but I actually like that.This is a one-piece wedge that is ready to use right out of the box.Our baby girl would only sleep in her bouncy seat, which we had to place on the floor by my side of the bed.She absolutely would not sleep for more than five minutes laying flat on her back in her crib.After reading all the horrible reviews on the expensive incline sleep positioners, which lay completely flat because it doesn't support a baby's weight, we gave the Safe Lift Deluxe Crib Wedge a try.In fact, she's napping in it now!I'm already recommending this to all my new mommy friends.Likely my fault it lists the description but my pediatrician said my 4 month old needs to be at a 45 degree angle, this one is about 30.She appears to be doing fine with that.I have no idea what the issue is that everyone is talking about with regards to the zipper.No problems here.It fits the exact width of her crib so there's no worry about her rolling off the crib wedge.Here's a couple of things that I had to do:1) The crib sheet tends to loosen with my baby in her crib.So I invested in fitted sheet holders that clamp the corners together so they do come loose.Easy to find at any target or here on Amazon.2) My baby wiggles around like crazy!There's no strap to keep her in place so I did what the nurses did at the hospital during her stay: take a towel and roll it up.Make it into a big 'U' and put it right where she sleeps.She sleeps in the wedge, right in the middle of the 'U' Shape!Prevents her from rolling from side to side or sliding off the wedge.It's way less expensive than paying $80++ for the other ones online.I recently pulled it out of storage for Baby #2, and my son (now 18 months old) became very excited.He asked me to set it up and watched it again!This is more than just a mobile since it has so much going on!I don't use mobiles for putting my kids to sleep, I use it to keep them entertained for a moment or two while I do a load of laundry or something.I have pumped exclusivly for two childeren now.I put my fresh bags in these and then when they get full, I transfer them into a big plastic storage box.The clippers and the thermometer are the only components I've used so far.I like that the nasal aspirator has a removable bottom to make for easy cleaning.I regret buying this, it seemed so convenient to have all the listed items in one package, but it is just poorly manufactured items, and there are much better items out there.Just buy them separately because you will end up doing that anyways if you buy this set.This kit contains a nasal aspirator, digital thermometer with case, soft-tip medicine dispenser, comfort tip medicine spoon with cap, magnifying nail clipper and a travel/storage bag.Pros:Comes as a set in a bag (you don't loose items as easily.Cons:-I'd rather have the smaller nail clippers without magnifying glass-The nasal aspirator from the hospital is better-I think it is dangerous to use the medicine dispensers included versus the droppers that come with medicationsSummary:It is convenient to have a bag with everything you "need," but this might be more than you need, or different than you need.After hearing a story from a friend about a preschooler turning on all the knobs on the gas stove and then going to bed I began my search for a solution and came across these simply knob covers.Toddlers can hit the knobs and spin them but they can turn the knobs themselves or accidentally turn on the stove.With one hand you can pop open the top cover, reach inside to turn the knob and then close it again.We have a commercial style oven.I found this potty at the baby store while I was actually looking for one of those fold up toilet toppers, which they did not have.This is way better and I am so glad I purchased it.So I think this will come in handy for some time!I love how this seat can be used as a toilet topper, and a portable potty!Comes in handy when you do have a toilet nearby but the little guy is afraid of falling in!I've also used it to top trash cans or a bucket so I can just spill out the mess.We take it outside in the yard with us while playing to prevent accidents, and avoid the not wanting to stop what I am doing senario...and we don't even use a bag then.Great for outdoor use, such as parks and picnics where restrooms cannot be found!You can also use this without a bag if you are in the grass or camping or such.In the car the bags are a great convience.I use regular grocery store bags and just throw a sanitary napkin at the bottom to absorb liquid.This prevents any problem with the grocery store bags leaking.And you can get a giant box of overnight napkins at the dollar store.Much cheaper than purchasing the actual bags.I have seen another potty that looked just like this one where the feet flip out so you can use it over a regular potty, but you can't do that with this one.This one can only be used sitting on the floor with the bag attached.It is so short and flimsy and the seat is so thin that it looks terribly uncomfortable.That seems so environmentally unfriendly and, if you buy the bags, you don't save much over using diapers.I'm glad this wasn't too expensive because I'll probably be buying a different one for travel purposes.We placed on the top of the doors as put less stress on hinges.I just want the mobile function, not the sound, but there is no way to turn down the sound or turn off the sound.I gave it three stars because I have other crib toys that make better music, but I can't use the music on them cause I got this lousy sounding thing going off instead.I suppose I could just have multiple songs playing at once, but how annoying is THAT?So, its a good mobile, but the music isn't good quality and it isn't optional... your stuck with it.I do not like that bag.So, off I went looking for another bag and found this one at a babies store in town.I liked that it was lightweight and that I could carry my purse, the baby's car seat, and have the diaper bag on my back without feeling overwhelmed.The bottle cooler keeps bottles very cold.The only criticism I have is that I wish that there were a couple more pockets in the bag.Otherwise, I love the bag!It seals really well so you don't have to worry about it leaking to dumping contents into your diaper bag.It also comes apart for easier washing and holds up great to the sani cycle on the dishwasher.Overall this is a great buy for the money!I also look forward to using this as a snack dispenser when the baby gets a little older.I love Avent products, and this formula dispenser is no exception.There are three components: A clear outer container, light blue insert with three sections for formula, and a light blue lid.I have had no leaking, no formula mixing into other compartments, and it it very durable.However, it is "chubby".I think it would fit in diaper bags and purses (even cup holders) better if it were shaped more like a bottle instead of a can.If you can find a graduated one, then it's better if you buy that.This really worked well that's why I ordered two.One for traveling & one for night feedings.This really separated the powdered formula & didn't mix in with the other sections even when it was in my diaper bag.I got these for my Medela Pump N Style horns.They accumulate dishwashing detergent residue and hard water minerals in the insides and I could not get it out.I like them a lot and will buy more when they deteriorate.I wish Medela thought to sell some like them.so I use them only for pumping milk.These caps are very useful for the bottles to store milk.That way, I dont have to use the nipple and cap.I wish that these caps were provided free with the Dr. Brown's bottles, especially seeing as how the bottles are so essential to begin with.These caps are great for mixing formula in the bottle, and also for storing formula or  breastmilk in the refrigerator.The only drawback is that you can't use them with your reservoir or vent in the bottle.They fit on my Ameda and Evenflo bottles.These are the only caps that will tightly seal the bottle, I've used the medela caps on those bottles and every single time I am mixing formula in the bottle they leak.These caps are made for the dr. brown's bottles so definitely get them, if you like to secure the bottles with liquid or make formula in them.This way you can ensure no leaks.These bottles do exactly what they are supposed to- provide a protective "shell" for the Playtex drop-ins.I have had no problems with leaking.The description stated "colors may vary" and I have to laugh when I see my little guy drinking out of his pink and lavender bottles, not that he cares a bit.:) (The third bottle is yellow.)I also learned the hard way that the type of hard, clear plastic used for these bottles is somewhat brittle and also will melt when placed in a bottle warmer.Had I know that, I would have made sure to order the other type of Playtex nursers made from the clouded plastic.She only uses the 10oz bottles once a day.Thus, I didn't have to buy so much of the bottles.I recommend you make sure you need a lot of them..until then, just purchase 1 or 2.Playtex drop ins are the best bottles!!Clean and easy to use and if you add the mild or formula in, all you have to do it heat up some water in a deep bowl and swish the bottle around and you have instant warm formula or milk!Would definitely buy again!The swing is cute with its design etc,...Takes up alot of floor room.This swing goes through D batteries every 2 weeks, gets expensive.I found that the mobile on the swing to be a real pain, when you are getting the baby in and out.Bop the babies head on the mobile.Sold ours on craigslist and purchased a plug in swing.I received my Britax Marathon as a shower gift for my first some (2006).I have washed this seat SEVERAL times and it still looks like new.We used it for DS#1 as a rear facing when he got to big for our infant carrier,  I do wish it had a tether specifically designed for the seat when it was rear facing but we made due.DS#1 is now almost 4 and about to move into a booster.We will now use this seat for DS#2 when he outgrows the infant carrier....I am sad this seat will expire while DS#2 is still using it but I plan to buy another Britax for him to use.Wonderful Product!I bought this pump after I had DS#2.I didn't want to spend the money for a big electric pump when I wasn't going to be pumping all the time and DS#2 is our last child.I love how easy to use this pump is.It's easy to use, easy to take apart and clean and easy to assemble.When I bought mine it also had samples of the Medela Breast Pads, Nipple Cream and 2 bottles in the box....a nice bonus.I use this pump mostly at night and pump the opposite side from which my son is feeding.I seem to get more out that way and it keeps me from getting to full over night.If you aren't going to pump all the time and just need one for a once in a while use definitely get this pump, you won't be sorryBut, I tried it again and tried to relax and easily got 3 ounces out in a little over 5 minutes.Because my hand was kind of tired at the end of it.I can't imagine when my son wants to drink more like 6 ounces at a time...so easy and comfortable to use, can be used with one hand can & can pump with either end of handle.i have this one and the lansinoh and the medela is way betterAt first it was a really great product.Then I had to start replacing pieces frequently, and having to break-down the whole thing every few days to wash it was irritating.If I left anything together mold appeared.Eventually after only a few months I could no longer get any suction no matter which piece I adjusted or replaced.She was only nursing 2-3 times a day at that point.I was able to use this pump enough to keep my milk up.It is portable, quiet and very easy to use.Also, the other medela parts are interchangeable.It is also very easy to clean.This pump is NOT meant to be used if you have a lot of milk to pump.Since it is a single pump and manual, it does take longer.This product looked great once it was put together.Called the company and the immediately sent out replacement pieces, super easy.Assembly was a different story.I have put together A LOT of furniture and this was the most difficult piece ever.You will need two people.The backing is just cardboard.While you don't see it, I would expect better than a piece of cardboard, which I almost threw out because it just seemed like part of the packaging.I was unable to get them screwed in tightly, but I had already planned on getting different knobs to make it a little more customized to match our room decorations.I put this together all alone and 24 weeks pregnant.took me about 2 hours(?)If you are considering buying this table I highly recommend it.Very nice quality for the price glad I made this choice.I just used this for the first time last night as Zoe is just now sitting up, and I LOVE it!It is SO easy to put in the cart, and the leg holes matched up perfectly (at Super Target) and the little velcro stayed fastened.She looked so happy and I wasn't worried when she started sucking on the hand bar thing - because it was covered!I threw this in the trunk of my car and I usually park by the cart return thing, so I just grab a cart and put the pad on, put baby in and go!Not so hard and I'm not lugging around anything.And I did have to thread the strap through the 2 slits initially, but it stayed so it's not as if I have to do it every time.I don't think that's a problem either!UPDATE!!!Okay, now that I've had some time to use this more and baby is getting older and moves around more - I WISH I had spent a little extra money and gotten one of the covers that has elastic around the whole thing so that it's a tight fit.The few places where there is velcro comes undone.I wanted a shopping cart cover for my baby.Not because I am a germaphobe; I just wanted something softer for him to sit in since he's only 8 months and just mastered the whole sitting up thing.If he suddenly flopped over, I wanted him to have cushion there.Up until now, he was just in his infant carrier, which I put on top of the shopping cart.Well, he is just so heavy, I no longer feeling like carrying the infant carrier around anymore (he's just under the weight limit for it).This cover was so easy to put in the cart!Took no time at all.He sat in it just fine and looked so comfortable.He was happy to be sitting upright looking around the store.I had a different cover with my first born (I think it was by Sassy or Infantino) and it didn't wrap over the whole seat area of the cart and it was a pain to get hooked up.This cover- totally different.I just popped it in, fastened the velco, slid in the seatbelt, done.Maybe 15 seconds.I recommend this cover to everyone.I love this thing more than I expected.We were slow to start using it, but my son has been at the age for awhile now where he MUCH prefers to be high up in a cart rather than in a stroller, and he's just too heavy to carry around.Yet, he's been teething like crazy and wants to put his mouth all over everything, to include the shopping cart if we were to let him.This thing takes seconds to put on the cart, and gives him a soft, clean place to sit, especially nice on days when the shopping carts have gotten wet.Now, it will fit a standard cart, and while it is not big enough to fully cover a Sam's club size cart, I still use it even there.I just use it to cover the half of the cart he sits in, attach the velcro as best I can, and sit my purse next to baby so he's not trying to slide over on to the uncovered side.I don't use this for high chairs in restaurants, I just can't imagine it fitting that well, but I guess it might be worth a try for someone who really feels they need it.You COULD potentially drop the strap since it's not attached, but I keep this cover in a plastic zipper bag (I believe it's the bag it came in, but can't remember for certain) and have had no problems.I just make sure the cover goes right in the plastic bag WITH the strap immediately after every use -this keeps it clean in the trunk and ensures I don't lose the strap.Worth buying, I really love this thing and have gotten compliments on it as well.Very practical because we shop a lot - groceries, etc.Baby (9 months+) likes to sit up and watch around her.With this, she stays clean.I keep it in the car.I love the 2 little tabs where toys can clip on.I have 2 special toys that I only let her play with while we're shopping, so she'll fiddle with them during the whole shopping trip.Almost every trip she'll lean over to put her mouth on the cart, but she has to chew on the cart cover instead!I've washed this several times and its still in great condition.I love this thing!It holds lots of toys and very easy to put up!I bought this hammock and it solved the problem!It stretches pretty far so if you wanted to take up an entire corner space (ceiling wise) then this is perfect!!I couldn't find one of these in a store, but was happy to find it on amazon!!Its a must for solving 'stuffed animal' space!My daughter is teething and she loves a piece of popsicle or watermelon in the bag.It was pretty easy to clean, just strong stream of hot water and a sponge.It did require a few tries to get all of the bits of strained pear out, but it didn't take long at all.Although, if left to sit for even a few minutes, I imagine it would be a great deal more difficult.I'm very happy with this product and it's been a great way to introduce foods to my daughter (who also dislikes baby spoons!I chose this soft food feeder because it was made in the US and the feeder bags weren't dyed.Why on earth would I want my baby to suck on a purple feeder bag when he can suck on an undyed one?These are easy for my 5.5 month old to handle, and in my experience clean up pretty easily it you turn it inside out and scrub with a toothbrush as soon as he's done.These are definitely an improvement over the cheesecloth that I was previously wrapping pieces of fruit in, though we'll see how durable they are once he's gotten some teeth.The screw on design is easy to use, and the replacement bags make washing up easier.(and you can buy new ones too)We got the munchkin brand first, and the design of that one is far inferior to this.also my 4mo old didn't deem interested in it at all.It keeps her busy in the car and in the stroller or if she gets bored with her swing I clip it on that sometimes too.The clips are a little hard to get to work you really have to just use two hands to open them up and push down hard.But it's worth it, in the car when you go over bumps the turtle will play it's little jingle.She loves grabbing the little animals on it.I bought a pretty princess seat cover just like this one and then saw this Sesame Street one in Burlington Coat Factory & confirmed (from taking it out of the box_) that it is the same thing, just different decoration.At any rate, I out it on the toilet and the overhang lip in the front does not hang over enough.If it did, I think it would help keep it in place better.However, the cushions on the underneath (wish they would show you that on the product images) are just that, a cushion.It has nothing to do with actually helping hold the potty seat in place, as it slides around all too easily.It snapped open well and I felt it was good, but once I sat my 16month old 21lb girl on it, I better understand the reviews others are giving.Although it's snapped together pretty solidly, when I put my daughter on it, she seat really sunk in toward the toilet water a bit, enough to worry me too much to keep it.My main issues with the seat though are that it:1 - had nothing to click it/stick it on the seat to keep it in place2 - sinks down under the weight of my 21 lb girl3 - I can see my own hands getting unsanitary from touching the seat to open and close it after being on the toiletI think it's a great idea, but not a well developed/made product to do the job it's supposed to do.After using it a few times I feel in love with it.We decided to get another one to use at home.We don't want to use the same seat in our home that we use in public restrooms for obvious reasons.We have a potty chair for her here at home that has a seat that can be used on the regular toilet and we can't use it at home.Our toilets are elongated and it slides all over the place and scares both her and I.With me being germ conscience and my husband a germ-o-phob the thought of potty training and public restrooms combined were the items nightmares were made of.The five stars and the title tell how I love this item, but here are the reasons why.At first we had to go over the characters every time we used it and she'd even try to point to the characters while she was using it.There are also cushions on the underside of the seat to keep it from sliding around while it's being used.The hinges actually snap in place and it's secure.The only time I have had it slide is when I did not have it properly secured on the front of the toilet.So that was my fault, not that of the seat.I'm surprised when reading other reviews for this item!My daughter is just over 2 years and weighs about 26 pounds.I have never noticed it bending, sliding or anything and I keep both eyes on her at all times in the bathroom.She has never had her bottom pinched nor has she EVER fallen into the toilet.I can't explain why my experience has been so different in comparison, but if I ever need a third seat I guess I'll have three of these.The only down side for me is that I wish it came with it's own little carrying case.I keep ours in a gallon sized ziplock bag and change the bag when I feel it necessary.Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.Not only does it bend when my 26 lb son sits on it but if he shifts his weight or leans to one side the seat jumps and moves.This seat really made him feel uneasy.The seams are not flat like this seat with big bird so be careful if you like to slide your child's bottom all over it but I feel there is no real threat using the primo.I also believe that's what makes the primo so much sturdier.Good Luck!We used this ring in public restrooms when we were out and about.Often it wouldn't fit the toilet very well and would slide around when my boys would sit on it, even if I carefully lifted them onto the ring myself.A couple of times it almost dumped them in the toilet and scared them to death.I don't recommend it.It has really been a lifesaver for me when my kids have had to use public toilets.It folds up super small and I just keep it in a gallon size zippy bag in my purse.You do have to be careful when you put it onto the toilet seat so that it doesn't fall into the toilet because there isn't anything that 'hooks' it onto the toilet.It just sits on top of the toilet seat.Fortunately I haven't ever had any of the falling into the potty problems some reviewers have had.I just lost my seat the other day...must have accidentally left it somewhere while out running errands...so I'm about to order a new one.I'll update and let you know!It fits well and is incredibly soft.I recommend paying attention the the costs of the different colors as some are more expensive or do not qualify for free shipping.We plan to purchase additional covers like this one.Fits perfectly in our changing table and really snuggles our daughter into its center.They are VERY soft, but durable enough to stand up to many washings (without fading).Would definitely recommend.I would buy again.I LOVE this cover and wish I had only gotten this one.It is so soft and absorbent!I can't help but agree with other reviewers who call this item out for what it is...pure price gouging by Arm's Reach.Leg extenders should absolutely 100% be included with this product, not sold separately (especially for a price of $20+).This really only means that the top of the co-sleeper frame is 24" high, NOT the mattress platform.If your bed is higher than 23-24" and you want your baby sleeping at the same level as you...you'll need to buy extensions, whether you choose to purchase from Arm's Reach or not.The extensions themselves were a must for us, as we have a pretty tall bed.I breast feed for 7.5 months a traveled a ton while breast feeding.The Medela bottles are much better for storing milk on the go or get the bags for freezing.These didn't work well and my little girls head still fell forward.These are hard to put around the head/neck when the child is asleep and when they are awake they don't want the head support around their head- it was aggravating to her.Maybe this would work better for a smaller infant, but not a child over 6 months in my opinion.Don't buy this product... totally sucks.It just doesn't fit right.We bought this product when my 6-month-old son moved up to a convertible car seat from his infant car seat.Because the car seat is more upright, his head was dropping forward when he fell asleep in the car.We installed the product as shown, but the first time he fell asleep, his head was pushed so far forward he snored loudly and then started wheezing.I pulled over, woke him up, and removed the pillows.We threw them away after one use.We got cushioned strap covers intead, and they seem to work better because nothing goes behind his head.I saw some of the negative reviews about this product and was surprised.This one worked well for our daughter.We mainly used it in a car seat and on swing and it helped keep her head in place!The thick, rubber lid stays on the tray and does not pop off in the freezer like some other product lids (Baby Cubes in particular).The food can then be popped out of the tray (like regular ice cubes) and placed into a zip-lock freezer bag for long-term frozen storage.The product is durable and of high-quality.Once I freeze the food and transfer it into a zip-lock bag, then I just pull out what I need (usually 1-2 cubes of food) for each feeding.I highly recommend these trays...you won't be disappointed!Hard to put the over on- but they worked pretty good and the food was pretty easy to pop out.I've tried a several different types of storage trays for freezing breast milk and baby food, and these have ended up being the most useful.I agree with other reviews that they don't hold 1 oz as advertized (more like 3/4 oz.Since I use these trays so often, after the cubes are frozen I store them in Ziploc Freezer bags.For freezing breast milk, the cubes fit through the opening of our Playtex dropins or natural shape Ventaire bottles so I could thaw the milk in the bottle (all the other trays we have make cubes that are too big so you have to thaw the milk in something else and then pour it in the bottle).Other trays that I've tried makes cubes in different shapes and portions, and you have to defrost a cube first to make room to fit another cube.So overall, the amount that the trays hold doesn't really make a difference to me, and the smaller portions have ended up being more helpful than a problem.It is entirely too hard to just pop one cube out.The whole thing has to thaw out (at least a little bit) for me to get anything out, which kinda defeats the purpose of having it.I was looking for a chemical free ice cube tray with a lid to make baby food in.We looked all over Amazon, compared prices and materials (silicon, etc.)I found regular ice cube trays with lids (holds a bit more per cube) but they were more expensive and they didn't claim to be chemical free.In using these, I just love them.The tray itself holds a smaller amount, but I make the food in bulk for a week so it really doesn't matter.Then I transfer them to a freezer bag, date it and start all over again.Getting the food out hasn't been a problem at all; just run the bottom under hot water a few seconds and if they don't fall out by themselves just poke it with a fingernail and it slides right out.Since I don't let the food sit in these too long, I haven't had any freezer burn or ice build up in them.I've washed them a couple times in hot soapy water by hand and the lids still fit fine (I reserve the right to edit my review in a few months!I love the one review where the lady has all different kinds of food in the freezer and you just grab a few cubes of fruits, veggies or whatever, defrost and ready to eat!It's been 3 months now, I use these trays almost everyday to make baby food in bulk and have not had one problem with these trays whatsoever.I still wash these in hot soapy water by hand and any residue from the food wipes clean off.No plastic peeling, no lids warping, nothing any of the other bad reviews have said is happening!The only thing worth mentioning is I have to run the trays under tepid water for *a few seconds* to get the cubes to come out.The cubes pop right on out; it's just like an ice tray so you have to twist it but if you don't run it under water first it might be harder.This does NOT defrost food but I have no experience with storing breast milk in these.these helped portion pureed foods for our child, but it has a few design problems worth noting.lastly it's not the easiest to clean due to its many hard angles.we ended up going with Beaba silicone trays with rounded portions.They're also good for freezing breast milk cubes - which I use in a mesh feeder for my son when he's teething.You can freeze fresh pureed baby food or breast milk in the cubes then pop them out so they're quicker to thaw out than if you froze it in a big ol chunk.Or, if you're on the go, pack your baby's lunch as cubes in the morning, and by lunch time they're thawed out but still cool.You COULD use a regular ice cube tray with no lid if you pop them out of the tray a couple hours later when they're frozen.But I tend to forget about them for a couple days, so the lids are a life-saver for me to protect from freezer burn.The lids are easy to put on and take off, but they aren't a 100% perfect-beyond-your-wildest-dreams kind of seal.For that reason, I wouldn't recommend storing the baby food in the trays, but just use them to freeze it until you happen to remember to pop them out.For what it's worth for the fresh-baby-food-makers reading this, my favorite thing to store baby food in is theRubbermaid 12-Piece New Premier Food Storage Container Setproducts!(Revised): Home Cooking for a Healthy Baby & Toddler... love it!the first thing i noticed when i received this was that the mirror was actually large enough and of high enough quality that you could see yourself.we tried it in the car, but couldn't get it adjusted right --  so i hung it on the wall by the changing table so baby can look right into it while i change him.i used a removable 3M wall hook (which are a miracle if there ever was one).This is by far the best car mirror I could find.The image is crystal-clear as opposed to the other car mirrors that have a low-quality fuzzy reflection.Also, my daughter loves this mirror!It keeps her entertained for a long time in the car--she giggles all the time at it.It secures to your headrest and won't go anywhere.I highly recommend this product.We had the rain forest mirror and all sorts of clip ons before purchasing this item.This is by far the best mirror for your car.It has a bag of beads that weigh the mirror down just enough to prevent shaking.I can see my baby clearly even when I am driving.The other mirrors just shook like crazy unless you were at a stand still.This product has worked phenomenally well for us.Baby girl is content instead of staring at the blank seat and when I glance back I can see her perfectly.It's cute, big, and sturdy.However, I was lucky to find this product at a thrift store in excellent condition for only $1.50!!!I refused to pay over $25 for it online.If you really want it and cost isn't an issue, it has been a fabulous product and I would recommend buying it.The only other downfall besides the cost is that you have to surface clean it only.But if you have kids & pets... everything has has the possibility of not remaining clean.I gave it 4 stars was because of the price.The actual product deserves 5 stars.I bought the monkey mirror.It's perfect for the back of my car.The mirror is clear.Everywhere I go I get questions wondering where I got it!My only complaint is that I wish the ties were a little longer.I looked at regular strollers and they are heavy and huge and really unnecessary for what our needs are...those strollers are for like Disney World lol.I just want something simple enough to get around a store.I don't plan on being out longer than a couple hours at a time so this stroller is perfect.And I love that I don't have to take the baby out of the car seat to put him in a stroller.How nice to just put the whole car seat on this stroller without having to wake him up.If I have any problems with this stroller I will be back to explain the issues but hopefully all goes well as planned:)I was so sad when my little one out grew this.It's those times when he's sleeping and I don't want to wake him up that I think about this stroller.Great product!!Easy to move around, up and down grocery store aisles etc.I am glad that I bought it, enabled me to spend more money buying the jogging stroller I wanted.This is great for trips to the grocery store.This product is great and Amazon has the best price on it w/ the free shipping.The car seat clicks on so easily w/out any fuss.It feels very secure.Perfect addition to your removeable infant car seat for shopping trips, etc.Don't waste your time with those bulky travel systems that every mom tells you they never even used.It drove me crazy.. Until I got this!!I used it for about 9 months, just click the carseat in, and you're good to go!Only negative is that you can't use it without the carseat.I loved it and used it nearly daily with no problems whatsoever.This stroller would be difficult if you went out for a jog with it, because you would surely end up kicking it.We purchased a Graco SnugRider infant car seat and decided on buying this stroller.We also bought a "real stroller" - Baby Jogger's City Select which is a lot smoother and more expensive.We use the Graco when we have to drive somewhere - it is extremely light, fits in our trunk and is a lot less bulky than the other strollers we shopped around for.It does the job for toting around your little one on wheels and because it is smaller is much easier to maneuver when shopping.You can even "pick it up" which would be a lot harder with our City Select!This is a great product for "in and outs" of the car...ie quick errands and grocery shopping).The basket is huge underneath and I often just put groceries in there when I'm shopping.I know I can live without this stroller but I am so glad I baught it!I love using this for those quick in and out runs.Just snap in the car seat and go!Definately will use for any future children!We live in the city and I thought this would be easier than purchasing a separate stroller, but the wheels on this stroller are plastic and not very shock absorbent.We had to go very slow so that the baby didn't jostle around so much as he's only 10 days old.Wish we would have researched if there was something more shock absorbent for infants.I wanted to update my review, my baby is now 6 weeks old.The brakes are not up very high and while crossing the street, my foot hit the brake and the stroller stopped in the middle of the street.I had the right of way, just wanted to update with the sensitivity of the brakes.This is probably me just being dumb.If you hit a big enough bump in a sidewalk I can see this thing going over.But, it is perfect for running errands at the store and I used it a lot that way.Many times I moved the sleeping baby from the car to this stroller to multiple stores and back to the car without waking him.- I never bothered with the cup holder again after I put a soda in there once and the baby ended up wearing it.- This thing was perfect the time the baby had a 103 fever and it was 90 degrees outside and no one was around to get me ibuprofen at the store and I had to take him with me.I use this stroller frame every day, so it's not so bad that I'd throw it out or anything, but I really wish I had bought one that had a few different features.Pros:Folds up very easilySmall footprint doesn't crowd others off the sidewalk and fits easily into elevatorsA stroller like this is really a must for those ghastly heavy and awkward carseats -- don't want to break your back!Fits in the trunk or back seat of my sedanConvenient for travel -- great for airports!The basket underneath is a life-saver for grocery shopping if you walk to the store (as I do).Cons:Handles very poorly on anything that isn't the glossy mall floor.It does especially badly on the sidewalks and roads around here (Boston).!That way, at least if it goes over she doesn't get launched out.Seriously, it is very easy to tip this thing, especially if you're walking at a decent pace.Hard to steer, even when you unlock the front wheels.It's easy to catch the parking breaks when you're walking.Annoying when that happens.Very difficult to UNFOLD this.It folds up pretty smoothly once you get the hang of it, but unfolding it requires two hands.The women at the airport who helped me through security all told me that the snap 'n go has one-handed opening.That would be very, very convenient.I've never tried the snap'n go, but I imagine it couldn't handle much worse than this one, and one-handed opening would be a dream come true, so I think you should check that one out instead!This is a good product.The car seat clicks on easily and it is easy to maneuver.I lugged my infant around for weeks in his carrier when I didn't have to!Very easy to open and fold, lightweight so easy to stow in the back of the SUV, small enough to maneuver through tight spots (like between racks or down aisles in stores), and turns on a dime.Decent storage under the seat, plus a cup holder and a second holder on the handle.This thing makes for and easy transition for my infant from the car to the walk so she doesn't get all upset and being unstrapped from the carseat and restrapped into a stroller.Definately cuts down on the fussiness.It is extremely lightweight and easlity stored b/c it collapses so flat.The basket is doable and the cup/key holders are sufficient.Goes very well with the car seat and saves you $200 for a separate stroller.I hated the bulk of the car seat in a regular Graco stroller, and a friend recommended this.I considered buying the cheaper one (not made by Graco), but I read in reviews that the seats weren't always secure in that one and that it was harder to use.This keeps the seat secure in the stroller and has ample space below for storage.If I try to remove the car seat carrier without undoing the clips, I end up picking up the whole thing - carrier and stroller - because the connections are that secure.I hated putting the carrier on the floor where the only stimulation she saw was feet instead of being developmentally stimulated with faces to look at!(We own the swing frame for the car seat as well, and it is a great system/package!)This stroller is easier than carrying an increasingly heavy baby in the car seat around a store.It moves about nicely, is less cumbersome and tacky than a stroller system, and does not rust, warp, or get ruined if your husband leaves it outside in a snow storm or a rain storm, or a hail storm...I would not recommend doing this, however.Yeah, the cup holder flies off if your drink is too heavy.Yeah, your diaper bag and other medium- to large-sized sundries don't fit in the low=profile storage area, lest you want your hands to become permanently stuck.But I toss smaller things in there all the time with no problem, and the otherwise easy use (and fairly easy assembly) far outweighs these minor setbacks.I decided on the Snap and Go stroller frame over a larger travel system because of the size of my car and lack of storage at my house.I loved how easy it was to move the baby from the car right into the stroller frame and vice versa.The bag at the bottom is huge and holds tons of stuff!I used to go to the farmers market and was able to fit everything I purchased in ther with some extra room!The cup holders come in handy too when out and about.It is now stashed in the closed waiting for the next baby to come!I tried this product instead of the more expensive options out there.I tried it on for only a few minutes with my 28 pound son and my shoulders felt like they were going to fall off.Not enough shoulder support.I was so glad this happened in the first few moments and not after a hike.Thank goodness for EBAY, I was able to get a used, better supporting pack for cheap.We purchased this carrier for our trip to Ft Davis, Texas where a lot of hiking is involved.had no problem with it at all.Also our 1 year old daughter who weighs 21 lbs.loved riding up high and being able to see everything.The only down side to it is there is little storage space but that really wasn't a problem for us seeing as I had a back pack with me that carried all of our 5 kids things in it.So all in all a good product at a good price.I would recommend it to anyone.It fits me 5' 10" and it fits grandpa 6' 5".My husband broke the crystals in the screen and we had to order an entirely new camera and monitor.The replacement is not nearly as high of quality as our initial.We are disappointed they didnt continue to make the same quality product.We bought this monitor after researching and trying a few other models.Pros:Excellent reception, even in a large old house- it works better than our wireless phones!Clear picture- love to be able to change the brightness of the cameraNight vision works great!Very sensitive- it will pick up anything in the room- including air conditioners, fans, etc.... it didn't really bother me, but i am used to sleeping with noise (I could see how it might bother sensitive sleepers)Excellent battery life!Cons:Did have some issues with interference with our wireless phones- the stand was literally right beside the monitor on my bedstand- a little manuvering and it isn't a problem (only when someone is using the phone... and that is only if you are standing right beside the monitor)I have to say- I would reccommend this to any parents- it is an excellent quality monitor that performs very well- we are very satisfied!I have two of these monitors (silver and pink) and they are great.This is because the handheld monitor can only monitor one camera at a time.You would only be able to hear/see one child at a time, and unless you wanted to spend all night switching between the two cameras, you need one monitor for each room.If you want to watch one child in two different rooms, you just need to get an extra camera.Super simple to add a camera; just set one to A and the other to B.The handheld monitor is set to whichever camera you want to watch.I have noticed that the pink camera seems to be "zoomed in" compared to the silver camera.It's not good or bad, just something that I noticed.Here's a quick run down on the monitor.Pluses:-- Good video even in little or no light: We tested this in daylight as well as in a dark room with and without a nightlight.The video was very clear and crisp regardless of ambient light.-- Easy set-up: It was very easy to set up the camera.I have them sitting on shelves (with the cord out of reach of my twins) rather than mounted on the wall.It means that I can move them from room to room as needed.-- Long battery life: I have the monitors on and plugged in over night (about 8 hours) and the charge will last all day (about 5-6 hours of actual usage).Of course, the battery last as long if you check the video frequently.Quirks:-- Background hum: There is a hum in the background that can be annoying, but it doesn't ever obscure the audio.The mic is very sensitive and you don't have to turn the audio up very much to hear your child well, which means that the hum is very soft.-- No volume markings: I found this annoying because the on/off dial is the same as the volume dial.You have to re-find your volume setting every time, and if your child is quiet, it can be hard to tell if you have it set loud enough.The way to get around this is to take a marker and mark the dial at your preferred volume setting.-- Handheld interference: If you have two handheld monitors, they can cause interference.If you don't need both cameras on at the same time, turn off the one you're not using.If you need both on, as in my case, simply flipping the handheld switch between A and B once or twice will remove the interference.Overall, this is a great video monitor system and I am so glad that I got it.My daughter-in-law just got this monitor for us, grandparents, to use when our grandson is sleeping over as his crib is downstairs from our upstairs living area.NO interference even with all of our computers, ipods, etc.!Get rechargeable batteries and you're set with this monitor!I think I would be worried about leaving my baby sleeping by herself (my first!)but now I feel more secure as I don't need to go to her room all the time to check on her.Baby monitor without video are worthless, in my opinion!If the baby is right in the border of your bed - for example - it won't make any different sound until he falls.But with the video you can see and save him before the accident happen!This monitor goes bzzz bzzzzz loudly and repeatedly a lot of the time no matter where you move it and then not at all at other times in the exact same place.Not only is this annoying while awake, but trying to sleep while listening to it is almost impossible.I guess it interferes with cell phone, wireless internet, etc.Also, the battery life is very short even if you follow all of the instructions for charging and draining the battery.Many of my friends have the same one and had same battery issues.Best advice, ask your neighbors which monitor they use and buy a different one because my guess is that it would have less interference if my neighbors weren't using the same one.I love having a video monitor and being able to see that my daughter is breathing.This device gives a clear picture and very good sound.It is in color, but be advised that if you are using it in a dark room, it shows up black and white (not that this matters at all).It also has a light display below the screen that indicates the volume of the noise in the baby's room, so if you have the sound turned off on the monitor, you can rely on the lights to tell you if the baby is crying.Another convenient feature is that when the device is running on battery power, the video display automatically switches off after a little while (the sound functions continue to work).A few cons: 1) I have more trouble than I'd like with interference and lousy reception, despite being in a smallish (1200 sq ft) apartment.Sometimes it just fuzzes out for no apparent reason, and cannot get a good signal no matter where I place it.Then it inexplicably gets better.It does not seem to be linked to proximity to the computer, the phone, or the cell phones.2) We live next door to a large apartment building, and when our camera is off or my receiver is on the wrong channel, I can see the neighbors' kids.I assume they can see mine, too.That sort of freaks me out.3) You cannot replace the battery pack.We accidentally left our charger behind on vacation and when we returned home, we were unable to use the monitor until we recovered the charger, because it doesn't take standard batteries.All in all, I'd recommend this product.I initially didn't care if we got a baby monitor that had video or not, but after a friend recommended this Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor, my husband was convinced that we needed a monitor with video capabilities.And boy, am I GLAD he did!We love this thing.Good battery life.HIGHLY recommend this product.Although the monitor  is a bit bulky (if you have plans of clipping it to your clothes where you are out and about in your own house), it worked well the first six months.I have never been able to figure out what the heck happened and why.I certainly would not purchase any of their electonic products again.We are so spoiled!This product has been a lifesaver... my baby was crying at nap time while I was cleaning up the kitchen and instead of letting it go I checked the camera and her leg was stuck in the crib rails!I may have let her cry for a only few minutes before going in to check on her!It's just nice to see her for reassurance.The only downfall I have is the handset whether plugged in or not picks up a good deal of static.Sometimes its the positioning, or the dog walks by, I roll over in bed, or someone walks in the baby's room...None the less I don't have an issue seeing anyone's baby like other reviews.I did take their comments seriously and actually considered not buying this product.However,I'm in a location where I am probably the only person to own this video monitor and didn't think it would be a big issue as there are SO MANY more PROS to this product.Enjoy!It really is worth the money and can be used for years to come!Our 14 month old has tossed the handheld monitor across our tile and wood floors several times, knocked it off the coffee table, and thrown it.The LCD screen shows no indication of any wear or tear.When I was pregnant I thought video monitors were probably overkill and didn't plan on buying one and my husband agreed.Our daughter had a lot of difficulty learning to sleep.And perhaps the cutest thing is watching her play alone when she first wakes up.I wish we had just bought it at the beginning instead of the sound only monitor!I carefully considered which video monitor I wanted to purchase and I decided that the Summer Infant Day & Night was the best choice in it's price range.The camera can twist and turn to many angles so that no matter where you put it in the baby's room, you can get a clear shot.I used it when I went to play in the yard with the older kids while the baby was inside napping.I also like that you can turn the video on or off which saves the battery life.It is also nice to be able to see exactly why the lights are going off on the monitor.I would always have to go in the room and potentially wake the baby up.This allows me to check on the baby without having to go in the room.It is so convenient.The viewing monitor is nice because it is lightweight and has a clip so you can attach it to your pants or belt if you are busy doing things around the house.The reception is great.She discovered on vacation how to get out of her pack n play.We put the video monitor in there so we could catch her in the act.I would highly recommend this product to any parent!We love this monitor.The video quality is better than expected.Not to mention I forget most of the time.So, I always end up going up and down the stairs to adjust the tilt.2.When you turn it first on, it goes into the video only mode.You can't hear even if the baby screams.I learned it the hard way.Make sure you turn the dial just a little past the on position.I know some people mentioned that the security is bad, everyone with a base can see the picture.It is not a problem in my neighborhood where houses are far apart.I tried to take the monitor to the neighbor's house and it did not work there.If you are living in an apartment though, I would be wary.Countless times, I walked passed the transmitter not in appropriate clothing...This is the only baby monitor I've ever used so I have nothing to compare it to.The video monitor is nice & clear, even in a very dark room.I have had no problems setting this up by her crib or accidentally seeing other people's houses, as some reviewers have complained.A few things I don't like:- There should be an option to the video monitor automatically turning off when you're using it as a portal handheld.(I realize this feature is made to save battery life and if I wanted to keep the monitor permanently on, I can plug it in.Personally, it's difficult for me to adjust the volume JUST RIGHT so I don't like that I have to constantly find the JUST RIGHT position, every time I turn the monitor on.If I can leave the volume right where I like it and have a separate switch to turn the unit on/off, it would save me a lot of fidgeting.- Lastly, there is intermittent static noise unless I keep the unit on a low volume -- this is the most annoying thing I've discovered about this monitor.No matter which channel I use or how close/far I am with the monitor, I can always hear intermittent static noise.This is not so much of a problem during the day but at night, it keeps me from sleeping!!So I have to turn the volume quite low but then sometimes I can't hear my baby cry, especially if I fall into a deep sleep...We've had this monitor for 9 months now and still use it on a daily basis.Hands down one of the best purchases ever especially since our baby's room is upstairs.The video is totally clear.I can fit three "size 1" dirty diapers in each bag.I carry a few in baby's diaper bag too.Others have mentioned a strong smell to the bags but I have no idea what they're talking about.My nursery doesn't smell of plastic bags or diapers, and these have saved me from buying a costly diaper disposal system.I've ordered these twice.The first time, they were alright and a decent price for the amount of bags you receive.The second order - the smell coming off the bags was horrific!It smelled like bug spray or something toxic - they would stink up the whole room!NO LUCK!They smell just as bad and my husband had to put them out in the garage.We'll be using them as poop bags for the dog instead of diaper disposal bags.Love these bags because they are just the right size for one or two diaper changes, they are lightly scented, and so convenient.We opt for these in the nursery over a diaper genie; we dispose of them in our garbage in the garage each change.This prevents smells from hanging around inside out house.Buy them.These bags are very nice.Big and the handles tie nicely, just be sure to double knot.They are good.But i like Especially for baby sacks better only bcoz they smell nicer but Sassy are not bad at all.I am just being a little picky.These are great little bags for those dirty diapers.Place the diapers in the sac and throw the bag back into your diaper bag so you can throw the diaper away later.They are also great if you go to a friends house who does not have a baby.I live in a townhouse that has 3 levels and I can't keep a diaper genie on each floor.These bags really do the job.They are scented just fine and lock in smell.By carrying these in your diaper bag, they won't even know you disposed of a diaper in their home.They could be priced a little better and come in a container instead of a box.We just throw the diapers in 'em, tie them up and throw them in larger garbage bag every few days.They are great on the go as well especially if you don't want to smell up people's trash cans when you are at their house.When my son was born 5 years ago this was something that we never heard of and never used, and had a hard time alays getting him to sleep.She does find her way out of it sometimes, but she doesn't seem to mind.I have tried the cotton flannel and microfiber and love the flexability of the microfiber material and it is SOFT!!I literally used every one of these up to the point of no more velcro was left to swaddle anymore!If you are thinking of buying...DO IT!I have another SwaddleMe in yellow which is in a better material (slight stretchy) but this flannel looks worn from Day1.get this but maybe not this material.I got a fleece version as a shower gift, and found it to be wonderful -- my daughter, now 5 weeks, sleeps best in it.I bought the flannel one thinking it would be good for naps when the room is a little warmer already.However, after washing it twice (and following the washing instructions), it is now an inch and a half smaller than the microfleece ones.My daughter is on the large side (she was 9 lbs at birth), and 1 1/2 inches doesn't seem like that much of a difference, but she can't wear the flannel one anymore.The velcro just barely doesn't reach.Love the fleece ones, very disappointed in this one.Although if you're looking for something light weight, I would just stick to the 100% cotton vs the flannel.The flannel is a bit stiff and doesn't stretch as much or feel as soft as the regular cotton SwaddleMe.Kiddopotamus seems really popular according to all the reviews but as simple to swaddle as it is, unfortunately, it doesn't have a very secure hold on the arms.As with all baby products, you have to test each out to see if it fits your needs...I gave this 4 stars b/c it works for its intended use however, I prefer not to use a cushion b/c they get so dirty.My little one is learning to feed herself and is very 'busy'in her chair.The cushion constantly has food smeared on it.After I realized she was fine in the chair without it (it was in the wash during a feeding time) I decided not to put it back on.This cushion is a must have if you already have the Svan highchair.It is a must have and saved my baby from hurting himself when he jumps back.I bought a Colgate 2-N-1 Innerspring Crib Mattress for my daughter's crib, and I have had difficulty to find a fitted sheet who fit this mattress (51.6 x 27.2 x 6 inches).Those sheet fit the mattress, they are tight but they fit.They've shrinked a little bit after I've washed and dryed them, but they still fit.They're not super soft, but my daughter doesn't seems to mind.These sheets are of very good quality, after buying a variety of different ones, these are definitely the best.Made of very good quality material and fits very well.Full elastic all the way around.Fabric could be a little bit softer, but not bad.Note that the pack of two gives you one checked pattern and one plain white!Great sheet set, and the blue checks is neutral enough for girls OR boys... so soft, even given the thread count.Didn't shrink or fade or pill, and fits relatively snugly over a regular mattress even with a waterproof cover.I washed it upon receiving.I've used the Boppy and the BrestFriend, but this pillow beats them all.It's wide enough to ensure your baby doesn't slide off, which was my problem w/ the Boppy, and it adjustable pillow makes a perfect angle for your baby's head as he/she nurses.Yes, it will flatten out w/ washings, but you can spot clean, which is what the manufacturer recommends.Even if it does flatten out, it's so reasonably priced that you may as well buy another.While this product is better than the boppy pillow for nursing it's not as easy to use as they make it look in the picture.Perhaps it'll be easier to use for this when he is a little older and has better head control.Basically the pillow is too soft to work to elevate his head.Maybe if it were firmer.So while it's an improvement on the boppy pillow, it doesn't work the way it should.I still don't think it was a complete waste but his head isn't elevated while nursing like I hoped it would be.It's bigger than I expected and maybe a little embarrassing if your kiddie bathroom is also your guest bathroom, but it serves its purpose well.These covers are not as thick as some others on the market, but just as functional.Outlets no longer exist in our house.My little one started having a particular interest in shoving those chubby fingers into tiny outlet holes so I bought these very quickly.I installed them while he wasn't looking and viola.. it's like the outlets never exist.i never had a problem since.And yes, it is hard to take off once you plug it in the socket but at least this means your baby won't be able to take it out either!These things are complete junk and fall apart whenever you (or your child) touches them...which in turn causes a potential choking hazard for the young child.Save your money.inconvenient and thus useless -- i used it once (it was irritating to put on) -- i removed after the sun was no longer shining through the window (so that my kid can see better) and it was difficult to store and then got dirty and i never used it again.useless!Also, since it is a generic rectangular shape, rather than being fitted for the shape of the car window, it didn't block the sun in certain areas.But, other than that, it did the trick.Once she is a little bigger this will work great and I like that it can be left on her and the tether removed.this product had a Velcro strap.if your child falls it could be dangerous.get a better product with a buckleI was a bit worried about buying the cheapest potty seat available, but it turned out great.We never even had to buy a freestanding potty seat, just put out daughter right on the potty.It works and my daughter likes it, so that's okay by me.It comes with a seldstick hook to put on the bathroom door so that it can be stored out of the way, nice touch.This product was easy to install, does take some time though.Have not had any worries of this falling over and hurting my daughter.My husband says the screws that came with this product are the worst he's ever dealt with.They don't go in straight and they strip.He had to go to the hardware store for replacement screws in order to install the brackets.Other than that, the brackets and zip ties seem fine.I can unhook them to vacuum behind the furniture, but they are secure and keep our daughter's dresser in place when installed.Nice product!We purchased this diaper pail simply because we didn't want to spend the money for the fancy Diaper Genies/Champs out there.The size is perfect for disposable diapers where we take the bag out every day or every other day.Target shopping bags fit perfectly in this pail.The only thing that fit was a small sachet of lavender that I made.It's annoying, but doesn't make me regret buying the pail.I have two of these, one for disposable and one for cloth.Especially useful for cloth since you are only supposed to wash around 12 at a time and if I wait too long, I run out of clean cloth diaper.When the pail is full, it only holds 15 at the most,  I end up washing the recommended number of diapers and I also don't run out of clean ones!This pail is an ok.It is easy to use and easy to clean.It holds in the smell when it is closed.It is easy to clean with soap and water, but it gets smelly fast.I also bought the odor pads that is suppose to help with the smell and they do not work.For being a cheap can it does the job, but you need to empty it every other day to help with the smell.It's functional and uses your normal trash bags.Not bad in terms of odors from a full pail, either.For dogs, on the other hand, it's an attractive nuisance.All they need to do is tip it, and the dirty diapers will spill out.We've had to clean up the mess too many times, and we're buying something to replace it.I needed a diaper pail with a foot lever and a place to put deodorizing disks.Six months later, I still hate it as much as I did the first week.It's too small.With two days' worth of diapers in it, the lid won't close.Which is ironic, really, as the foot lever mechanism is so ineffective, the lid barely opens when I want it to.This means every time I have a dirty diaper, I step on that lever, the lid opens about 2-3 inches, and I then try to maneuver the dirty diaper into the pail without hitting any of the dirty diaper surfaces against the outside of the pail.Which is nearly impossible to do.This can does hold scented disks (sold separately) in the lid, so it gets two stars for that.Otherwise -- this is the worse flippin' diaper pail on the market, and I cannot for the life of me figure out why a brand as reputable as Safety First would even bother producing it.I thought this product was larger than it really is - Note that the Amazon dimensions must be the box it ships in.This is more of a disappointment to me because I plan to use it for cloth diapers, and it doesn't look like it would hold more than 8-10 at most.The quality is what you'd expect for the price - adequate.This is a great product and a low cost alternative to diaper genie.It keeps the odor in control and we did not have any problems like some other reviewers have reported with a odor blast when its opened to put another diaper .. we always roll the used diaper and put the tape around it and use regular shopping plastic bags that fill up fast so it works perfectly for us.First off I want to say this bag is very small, I have only had it a short time so maybe I just need to break it in a little.That being said, it's a very nice bag and made very well.The stroller straps are very handy.After having to return two mobiles for not fitting my daughters crib, I purchased this one praying I would not have to return it.Instead of staring at the ceiling fan in the nursery, she becomes enthralled now with this mobile!I will place her in the crib and turn on the mobile during the day to take a shower and she does not once cry.The only downside is that it will only stay on for 10 minutes.There is a remote that will start it once it stops, as to not disturb baby if she has fallen asleep.She has not once fallen asleep to it yet, but we are not quite at that stage.The accessory kit has been used a lot.The extra bottles come in handy because now I can pump and store without worrying about not having bottles for my next pump.I wish the set also came with extra collars and nipples.The nipples are not so mush of a problem as the collars are...I can find the nipples here at Amazon.com but they don't sell the collars.The extra breast shields also comes in handy because I always have a set on hand while the other is being washed and dried.The only difference is the clear part of the shields that came with my pump came in 2 parts where as the shields with this set is one piece.I haven't used the micro bags yet since I have the Avent Micro sterilizer.I'll probably save these bags and use them when we go travelling.This cloth diaper cover is great because it is easy to use.I like it better than plastic pants because it does not leave elastic marks on my daughter, yet it works just as well.It is also nice to have the velcro tabs like a disposable for really messy diaper changes.It doesn't have leg gussets, so there isn't that extra protection from blow outs.The fabric is stiff and seems really uncomfortable.This is my least favorite diaper cover.I think the proponants for this cover like the durability of it.If you are looking for an all around comfortable yet durable cover check out Thirstys Duo Wrap.The fabric is water proof but very pliable.You may have to treat it a little kinder than this stiff plasticly thing, but you baby will be able to move around and not feel like he/she's wearing a plastic shower curtain.Happy hunting!Please don't waste your time with this cover!I don't know why a lot of people recommend this cover.The fit is horrible and the fabric seems like it would be so uncomfortable for the baby.It's really stiff and stains easily.Because the materials is so stiff, it is not easy putting it on a crying baby.There are no leg gussets and doesn't contain the mess from blowouts.The fit rides really low and wide.The only reason why this cover seems good is because it will last through many kids, but what does that matter if it's not comfortable for the baby to wear and it looks dirty from all the stains in it?Thirsties and Imse Vimse wraps are far better in every category compared to these.There are lots of liners for cloth diapering out there, but this is the only one I know of that is washable.If you are using cloth to save money, then this is the way to go.I've tried 3 brands of liners (Imse Vimse, Biosoft, and Kushies) and these are the BEST!Using the baby size (about 10" long) they cover more than enough for my 14 month old, and any overhang I just fold/stuff in.We wash any that are just wet (and obviously toss the poopy ones), and they soften to the texture of a dryer sheet.They don't get snagged in any velcro or caught in our lint compartment of the drier (unlike the Kushies).Super easy to use, and Dad friendly.I'll be sticking with these for the remainder of our diaper years.This liner is easy to flush, but is a tad too thin in my opinion.It doesn't hold wet poop that well.It is softer than the Kushies liners, but doesn't hold up as well.So, I have to use two, which gets more expensive.They do stand up to washing well, and are a good value for the money.I have not used them long enough to see how the affect the septic system, but they make flushing the poop very convenient.I did this understanding that it would not mask the smell as good.Instead I keep a box of inexpensive diaper sacks in the changing area and for any smelly diapers - I put it in a sack before throwing it in the pail.When it's full it does get a little stinky but it really hasn't been bad at all.The deodorizer chamber is large and you can add your own.My main problem with this pail is that it doesn't seal.The hinge in the back has open holes where stinky diaper air can get out.However, I love this diaper pail, it's a great inexpensive option if you don't mind putting the diapers in the sacks yourself instead of buying expensive refills.I wanted to buy a diaper pail that wasn't too bulky and this seemed just right.It can use any standard trash bag which is a plus.I certainly didn't want to buy special bags for something that holds dirty diapers!I wouldn't want dirty diapers hanging out in a room for more days than that anyway so this is just right!As far as odor goes, if you change it often and not let the diapers steep in their own grossness, you won't have issues with odor.However, I find the handle somewhat uncomfortable to hold.The end of it has ridges to clean out nipples, but I don't think it does too well.All in all, I would recommend this product.It lasts!The bristles don't get all misshapen and they don't fall out.Plus you don't get sprayed by water when you pull it out of the bottle!i go through bottles like crazy and i absolutely adore this bottle cleaner....and i do not have any avent bottles-so it works well with any type of bottle.the picture does no justice because it is a lot bigger in person.also, they have them at stores such as walmart for the same price.It even squeezes into those slim tube-like containers for storing breast milk (I wasn't sure it would).It is more expensive than most bottle brushes, but it is definitely worth it because it works better, doesn't have to be replaced frequently (if ever), is easier to clean/rinse the soap off of, and cleans all bottle and pump parts very easily.Unlike most bottle brushes, this one has more spaced out bristles that are stronger and more flexible.Those flexible bristles are what make it possible to squeeze it into small containers and clean every nook and cranny of the bottle and pump parts that have a lot of nooks and crannies.No matter how much I abuse it (by using it to clean those small milk storage containers), it never shows.Plus it doesn't have that gross falling apart sponge thing at the end that others have.With its uses beyond just baby bottles, there was no worry about spending a little extra for a product that should last indefinitely!i recommend this to all my friends.it is very durable, the angle gets into the bottle better then the typical brush, and the tip has divots that clean the bottle nipples.The spiral end cleans the inside of the nipples well also without much effort.Each to hold and lasts a long time.The bristles are a bit stiff but I don't mind the spraying of soapy water so much as long the brush cleans the bottles well!Made of durable plastic so hopefully, I'll still be very satisfied after putting this to good use!The bristles are thick and clean well.The bristles can't get in there very well.I had a couple of transparent ones for her before this, and they were hard to find because they disappear into crib sheets etc.Within the first week, my baby was in NICU and she would suck on absolutely anything that was put in her mouth - any kind of pacifier, my fingers, any bottle, and my breast.However, by the second week, she had gotten picky.She only likes my breast and Soothie pacifiers.Through my own experience and conversations with other breastfeeding mothers, I have realized since I had her (and have been experimenting with bottles so I can maybe have a break once in awhile) that orthodontic nipples are not a good idea if you are trying to teach an exclusively breastfed baby (particularly a stubborn one) to accept something other than mother's breast.She may be willing to take it when she is older and isn't so particular (she is 2 months old right now), but another thing that I don't like about these is that they have so much room for bacteria to hide, whereas the soothies are one piece and easy to clean, so even if she would take one of these later, I don't think I will bother with them.I am not concerned about the effect of the non-orthodontic pacifier on her teeth because I don't plan to let her use them that long and my son had no dental problems at all using soothies and stopping at one year.I had already been leaning toward getting adhesive ones so we wouldn't have to drill into our nice cabinets, but the decision was confirmed when we tried to even see if one of the other drill-in style locks we had would work.No such luck.Enough room that we aren't pinching our fingers trying to activate the mechanism to open it, but small enough that our 18 month old is thwarted.There are also screws included, so if the adhesive for some reason fails (which it seems nowhere near possible on any of the ones we have already installed).Regardless, whether they are used with the adhesive or not, these are the only cabinet locks with the length needed that could ever have worked on our frameless cabinetry.The idea was that I could be guaranteed that at least one of the products would work.Anyways Safety First product was better quality and sturdier than this one.This product is ok for a piece of furniture that isn't that heavy.These locks worked GREAT, until my daughter turned 1 year old.now, she pulls the cabinet door open as far as it will let her, then slams it back closed- as fast as she can- bang!bang!bang!bang!bang!without fail, she then tries to stick her fingers in to pry the door open while slamming the door shut (dont ask me- it's just what she does!)so now i'm searching for those magnet locks which keep the door completely closed.ugh.perhaps these are better for older kids?not so sure, but i know they are worthless to me now.I want to keep my child out but I want to be able to get in!All in all I wouldnt' recommend to others unless you hardly ever need to get into the cabinet you are locking.compared to the other lock, this one has the farthest reach between knobs.good for when there is a vertical piece between doors like the picture.a little harder to work, but you get used to it.Plus I figure when he's done with formula, we can use it for cereal or another small travel snack.Very pleased with this purchase, especially because we got lucky on the colors and got the green and blue shown for our little boy!It holds enough formula for 3- 8oz bottles.The reason I gave it 4 out of 5 starts is because the cap does not need much pressure to open and one time it got bumped in the diaper bag and spilled formula.But in 2 months of use I've only had it spill once.I found this at Target and I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it to the parents of any formula fed babies!I did not care what colors were sent to me because this is my daughter's favorite kind of sippy cup, and I was thrilled to find them on Amazon.The price was great- better than what I paid at a local store for the cups.The cups were also better quality than what I got at the store because they have a lock that you can feel click closed when the top is tight enough.I am sure I will be ordering more of these at some point!love these!never leak and the handles are great, bc it means a lot less dropping - so they are the best wehn you are on the go.This is a great product.We've tried lots of sippy-cups for our 18 month old.This one is good for him and good for us.Two are pink (very pink).I fill these with water.Sometimes juice.They don't have the concept down 100%.Sometimes they turn it upside down and gnaw on the bottom.Sometimes they just play with them.He isn't all that great at handling the cups without handles, he tends to turns those up side down and try to suck on the bottom of the cup for some reason.With these cups, he holds the handles and attempts to drink from the spout like a big boy!He's still figuring out he needs to tip the cup back to get the last half of liquid out of it, but I imagine that will come in time.As another commenter said, the valve is easy to remove and clean, but the inside of the spout is very hard to get to.I've also had to use a toothpick to get into the corners because black mold collects in there.No matter what I did, I couldn't get to those spaces to clean it out.Also, the plastic makes the drink taste terrible.If you've had juice in it, the plastic holds the flavor and then your next drink (water) has a hint of the juice.I've had to throw mine out.The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is because it doesn't spill, though, if the valve gets loose, it will.Well about 4 months ago our string snapped :( I called Haba up and they sent out a replacement right away.I have to say their customer service was the BEST I've ever dealt with and I highly recommend their products and service to everyone!Definitely recommend it.My 18-month-old uses it every day.She walks around the house during snack time with it and it keeps everything clean and crumb-free.We also let he use it in the car.The tops are such a soft plastic that my daughter can easily grab her snacks.I have only had this brand, but have some friends with other brands, and ouch!The tops are such a hard plastic and once they saw mine, purchased this brand.I like all the colors and graphics - although I have scrubbed some of the designs off, so now I try to wash them a little softer ;)  Super product!Alright, I will confess that I bought this at Babies R Us because I liked the concept of the trap.I thought that this would be great for my little one since she is 10 months old and loves hand feeding herself.The lid stays on when she eats, however she pulls out fist fulls at a time.Also she likes to shake it upside down and dump it all out.So, maybe not the best idea for under 2 years of age.I guess I will look for something that she can't make huge messes with when we are traveling.My daughter and I both love this product.The only down side is the cute little picture start to come off after a few runs through the dishwasher.They aren't 100% spill proof but they do cut down on the mess and are great for on the go.Cheerios were too small & easily fell out so we put cheesy bunnies in these cups.At first, she didn't like sticking her hand through the opening but soon figured out that if she pushes the sides down, the opening becomes bigger -- of course, this also means more snacks come spilling out...I definitely don't use these in the car b/c that's just a massive spillage waiting to happen.They got loose after a couple of month and eventually got to a point where they were barely closing.So I made the switch to Snack Catchers by Munchkin and am so much happier!I like that this is organic and has no bad materials.My husband and I used for a lot of "mall walking" during my maternity leave in the dead of winter in Minnesota.However, even with the "lumbar support" this thing will still kill your shoulders within 30-60 mins depending on the size of your kid.Also, if you put baby facing outward his legs really splay open and it just seems really bad, ergonomically speaking.We used this carrier recently on baby's first trip via airplane.It was great carrying him around in the airport and having my hands free for luggage and other stuff.I was able to sit on the plane with him strapped in asleep, which was nice.We used the carrier with him facing him forward as well.The nice bonus with this carrier, and I suspect with other carriers, too, is that you don't have to take him out of it when you go through the metal detector at the airport security gate, since the carrier has no metal parts.The only advice I can give is wear the baby a LOT and you get used to it.We started off with a basic Bjorn which we still use often (it stays in the truck for running errands) but for hiking we got the Active.I can get it it on, put the baby in, adjust everything and then put my day pack on my back without anyone's help - which isn't easy to do with a back carrier for a 6 month old.Our son hates looking inward unless it is nap time and when he drifts off all I do is pop the 2 top clasps, open one side, flip him around and reverse everything.I can get about a 4 to 5 mile hike in before my shoulders and back have had it - our son is around 20 lbs now.I can fit the baby in a thick bunting suit in it and as well you can tuck a blanket under the front area when they look out for extra warmth over their core.On a side note the back support doesn't interfere with my day pack and I love that.We really enjoy the baby Bjorn carrier and have had this classic style since 2008.I have used it to take both of my children to the grocery store.plus it allows me to place my toddler in the seat and go shopping without waiting on someone else to come home.Our only complaint with this carrier is that as the child grows the pressure on your neck and shoulders can really take a toll, which is why we will probably put this away by the time she's 20 pounds.I would still consider it a good buy though.This carrier is said to be good up to 25lbs.Oh how wrong this statement is!I would say it is good up to about 10-12lbs max.I took my daughter who is 20lbs on a 45 minute walk a couple weeks ago in it and when I returned my back was in spasms and I had huge red identations in my shoulders from the straps literally gouging into my skin.I was in pain for several days thereafter.I would not recommend this carrier.My son is 4 month old and weighs 20 lbs.This carrier is not meant for us as he is too heavy and my shoulders suffer from  carrying him...i recommend however the BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Organic Comfort Carrier with the waist support for bigger kids!Another one of my favorite baby buys.I also stuff it in my stroller basket for when we do longer walks and baby gets fussy in the stroller.However, she is now close to 5 months and on the heavier side and the carrier is starting to kill my shoulders.I just purchased the Ergo carrier and will see how that works since its suppose to shift their weight to your hips instead of them hanging on your shoulders.So all in all, I loved this product SO MUCH especially when my baby was a newborn.Also just keep in mind that with this color, the babys head will constantly be rubbing on the neck support so it tends to look dirty quickly.Great product, we use it quite often.Baby falls asleep in it.Small quirks though, the only issues I have is with the bottom part where the babys bottom sits.It just doesn't seem ergonomic to the babys legs.Also, the top part that folds down is another issue, he puts his mouth on the fabric, which is fine but also on the plastic part that secures him to the chest, another design flaw.Other than that, I've been pretty happy with this carrier.Love this sling.Tip: when facing baby out, you can put a bib through the arm holes and have it drape over the top.Good idea to have an umbrella handy for walks as there is not the shade that strollers provide.Another tip, when baby is in the sling, I eat or do things in front of a large mirror.It keeps him entertained.My daughter loves this carrier, and so do I.It is extremely easy to use.I hardly use a stroller anywhere because she would rather be in the Bjorn.I would recommend getting the covers (sold separately for about $17) for when they start being carried in the "front" position.My car seat turned out to be way too heavy to drag around for errands, and some stores don't have buggies or aisles wide enough for strollers.My baby was also one of those who cried pretty much every time she was put down and never slept longer than 30 minutes, and I really needed to find a way to get some laundry and dishes washed every once in a while.I tried a pouch sling, but I returned it after 2 uses - I felt like the baby couldn't breathe - sure enough, that style was recalled a few weeks later for that very problem.The Bjorn was a decent alternative, but really wasn't fast, convenient, or well-fitting enough for me.I would probably try something different the next time.Easy to understand & use the clips & fasteners3.Baby loved it & usually fell asleep in it until she became very alert @ 8-10 weeks, then she enjoyed the view4.Awkward to maneuver baby into2.Back pain - I pinched a nerve in my back the 2nd time wearing this when the baby was only 10 lbs.and I'm still getting twinges 4 months later.(And I was wearing it properly according to the directions).3.Because the carrier rides so high on the chest, it is not great for large-busted women.It was ok when the baby was forward-facing.She liked snuggling there, but when I turned her around @ 4 months, it wasn't comfortable for me and I didn't feel she was quite secure enough because my chest was against her butt or back and pushing her out too far from me.4.Baby occasionally spit up from the pressure of my chest on her tummy (she rarely spit up out of the carrier).My daughter (5 months) loves this, she will spend hours in it if she has to.I can't compare to other brands, but my daughter wants to be held nonstop, so this allows me to get somethings done around the house.I also find this easier to manage when I'm out shopping than a stroller.I will say she weighs 17 lbs and is getting a little heavy.I'm hoping this will get us through till she starts walking and just use an umbrella stroller, but if not I'll be in the market for a similar product.I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted but I am not the sling/wrap type of mom.Even though we had a big baby (9 lbs) he slumped in it awfully so I put it away and figured I would try every couple weeks.He'd howl after 5 to 10 minutes.I was frustrated but I needed him to like some kind of carrier so we could go hiking.No crying, nothing!He often falls asleep and I can easily flip him around by myself in a matter of a couple minutes.I especially like that putting the carrier on is EASY!Takes a minute and good to go.With him now nearing in on 7 months and around 20 lbs we don't use this one as much - we have the larger Bjorn Active for hiking/extended trips - but keep it in the truck/diaper bag for store trips, etc.This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining (5 stars), theBoba Classic Baby Carrier, Glacier(4 stars), theInfantino Ecosash Baby Carrier, Bloomin Vines, 8-35 Pounds(3 stars), and theInfantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds(2 stars).Here's her general intro:"I'm 5'5" and around 130 lbs.Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.* It is easily adjustable from mom to dad sizing.* The clip in the back on the arm straps keep the carrier from getting looser as you carry.* The stiff supporting body keeps the wee babes upright and their breathing passages open.* The face-out position is very simple to configure and can be done without putting the baby down, while still wearing the carrier.CONS:* Like I said, we loved this carrier, but really only for babies from 8-10 or 12 pounds (which lasts about a month with my kids) because of the weight put on the shoulders and upper back.* Also, some say it isn't great for hip development to hold babies by their crotches.I inherited a Baby Bjorn from a relative for my newborn.The Bjorn seems small and simple to use, but it's narrow crotch support puts too much pressure on my baby's crotch area (and she's only 10 lbs).Her crotch is always red with white blanched markings after each time she's carried in it.The rampant return of blood to that area had me fooled that she had diaper rash!I also didn't like that you couldn't just pull up that backing to hold your child to you like the Boba, Beco, Ergo, Lillebaby, heck like most other carriers.You had to snap the backing into straps on your chest which made for a less snug hold of your newborn to your chest.The chest straps also often fall away from your body making the hold even less snug and wind up scissoring my child's face in between the two straps.Often it's impossible to try to put your squirming child's leg into the half attached bjorn and then lift your whole child to attach the other side of the carrier.And the attachment of the back straps to the carrier body at the crotch area seems very unsafe as the slightest pressure on the inserts cause them to slide out of the attachment mechanism.If that should fail your child would slide right down out of the carrier.I'm on the hunt for another better designed carrier.This is a great carrier!She was happy and falls sleep in the carrier.My husband was able to put her down to crib without waking her up!I'd give it 5 stars if I could use this carrier on my back.I kept it and plan on using it on the other little baby that we're expecting soon.I washed it pretty frequently (my baby was said to have reflux) and the color still holds well.I have now used my Baby Bjorn for 3 babies.It is good for quick trips.Anything more than and hour and a half and my hands go numb wearing it.It has held up extremely well.I prefer a buckle carrier with hip support (Ergo, Beco, Piccolo)for a larger baby or when using it for a longer outing.If you hope to use a baby carrier for more than that (frequent use, use through toddlerhood, etc.)then I would recommend you invest in a really good carrier (Ergo, Beco, etc.Man this is a horrible carrier!My son was never comfortable in it, he looked like he was suffocating or his neck was stretched.This thing is a waste of money!I found the babybjorn helpful.We used it when our daughter was less than three months for trips to the hardware store.She is now older and can face out.My daughter must find it comfortable because she falls asleep in it.I also love slings but this is much easier to position her in and get her out.I took one star away based on the fact that it did not work as well until my daughter had better head control.it's relatively easy to use but not that quick to put on.I can imagine it will be more uncomfortable when he grows up.but i do like the convenience of it to use when shopping, and even at home.my son likes it most of the time, and he falls asleep in it b/c of the rocking motions while i'm walking.It took me forever to figure out how to angle it right so it closes automatically!Otherwise, looks like a durable solid product.A video on istallation would have been very helpfulThis towel is very cute and does it's job well.It' not as thin and flimsy like a lot of baby towels but it could be a little bigger.Initially, I wasn't sure whether I should buy this towel because the duck's feet looked like they'd stick out over the baby's head but the reviews were so good that I bought it anyway.The duck's feet do stick out but they don't get in the baby's face at all and they look kind of cute actually.The towels that I owned before buying this were all purchased from Babies R Us and were in the same price range as this towel.The duck towel, however, is much softer, about a foot longer and about 5 inches wider than those other towels.It also has a large hood big enough for a toddler.I wasn't expecting this kind of quality at such a low price.I also purchased a Trend Lab towel that's in the same price range at the same time and the duck towel is slightly bigger, thicker and softer.If you are looking for quality on a budget, this towel will not disappoint.This is a good baby towel, but not my favorite.The one thing I hate about it though is the legs on the frog.While the overhang seemed cute initially, it has proven to be more of an irritation now, to have these legs hanging down on the baby's head, besides which, they always crinkle and twist up, and therefore, don't look great unless you were to press them.i got both this one and the 4 month Combi teether and my baby likes this one the best.don't let the age limit you to just buying for an older baby.my guess is that it's made of silicone or something similar.definitely a 5 star product!!!My daughter was teething at about 5-6 months and she used this sparingly.She would chew on it and then just drop it to find something else to chew on.It's durable and easy to clean and will keep her busy for a few minutes at a time, but that's about it.They are very easy to drink from and have a small spout which is easier for little mouths.The cars designs are so cute.They almost look 3-D with cute race track back grounds.Can't go wrong with these cups.Easy to clean too.We use this every time we put our son down to sleep.It's harder for him to fall asleep without it since his arms and legs are flying all over the place keeping him awake.With him swaddled he goes to sleep right away.He was 6 lbs when we first used this, we had to wrap it more and had troubles till he was a little bigger.my 2 month old refused to sleep on back.we put him in this and after three nights he is sleeping eight hours straight in bed.This product is overall good, the only problem with it is that our baby can get out of it if she wants to, she can kick the part off of her feet and even the part around her sometimes.She is 6 months old.We only use this swaddle for naps away from home, we keep it in her diaper bag because it is more compact than the Halo innovations one (which we use most of the time).This swaddle has really good velcro and is very soft, it also is much more adjustable than many brands.Its easier to use than the miracle blanket, and although my son broke free from this swaddle when he was 4 months old, he's stopped doing it.It allows him to sleep from 6p-6am almost all night without waking up!However, one night he was fussing, so I thought I would try this out.I tried it a couple more time, with the same result each time.Like most baby products, I guess the success just depends on the baby.it stayed tight, washed well and was super cute and stylish.It was nice because you could just put it over the babies clothing.And our friends were shocked how fast DD fell asleep when we wrapped her up.She really never got out of this until she got older.My newborn is so distracted by her own hands - she can't sleep more than twenty minutes without this.It's nice for us because we just run the A/C at night and keep her bundled.** update - now that my daughter is 4 months old and still requires swaddling we upgraded to a bigger size.Haha.This was one of my favorite baby products.He's always been strong, but the velcro was sufficient to keep him wrapped snuggly.Prior to this, we were using blankets to swaddle him, the way they taught us to in the hospital.He always found a way to break out of the swaddle both in the hospital and at home.So we bought it, and it has done wonders because he no longer wakes up because his hands got out of the swaddle and startled him.He's three months old, and we continue to use the product.However, our advice is to consider buying a cotton one before you buy the fleece.Most of us heat our homes to around 70 degrees, so the fleece might end up being too hot.We noticed that our baby was starting to develop a heat rash, so we switched to the cotton Kiddopotoamus SwaddleMe blanket.This worked well, and the heat rash went away.Another tip - we've noticed that our baby can get his hands out of the swaddle now.If you allow him to fold his arms on top of him, he will be able to get out as he gets bigger and gains in strength.Our daughter turned one in December and although she is still in her infant seat.She didn't want to be in it in the stores.We got this for her stroller to go in and out of the store.Now he's 9 months and winter is rolling around again, but he outgrew his Infant Bundle Me.So I went ahead and bought the Toddler Bundle Me.At first I thought is it really worth it considering he's gonna be in a snow suit?I was so grateful for the Bundle Me when it was freeeeeezing outside and my little guy was so cozy and looked so comfortable sleeping peacefully in his stroller.Me and my husband wanted to be him at that moment!!!But, I have one minor complaint (not even worth deducting a star from my 5 star rating) -- the back of the Toddler Bundle Me has a "hood" with an elastic band that is supposed to hug the back part of the stroller's seat.This was NOT in the Infant Bundle Me so I was a little disappointed they added this.I have a Graco Metrollite stroller and the back of the seat is not flat -- it has contouring wings on the sides for added head support... and the "hood" does not fit over the seat properly.So we just don't use it and just lay it flat.It doesn't fall or anything.I don't know what I'd do without the Bundle Me!I was tired of of putting blankets on my daughter and figured this was easier.It's easy to put in the car seat but I thought it actually went on the seat in replace of the original car seat cover.There's nothing that attaches the bundle me at the foot.The original reviewer was right when they said the top is really long when you unzip it.Overall though I think it's a great product to keep her warm so I don't have to mess around with sweaters and blankets.The entire line of Baby Joggers (City Mini, City Elite) and BOB strollers have connected hoods/mesh to the back of the seat.You can not slip it around so it will never be secure.Big disappointment.Hope this saves someone else from the hassle.It cleans up nicely and I love how it folds into a bag.I keep it in my trunk all the time; you never know when it will come in handy.If the ground it wet it will not soak through.I guess the only downside is if it gets really dirty you need to go to a laundry mat to use a super sized washer.It's a material that is slicky and repels dirt.So just don't set it down on top of dog poop and you will be ok.I have used this product almost every day since I got it!It is waterproof - great for when my friends baby spit up all over it - a quick wipe and it was clean.I plan on using this in the backyard, at the park, at the beach... everywhere!The zipper on our old outdoor blanket failed a couple years back so we finally decided to replace it.I ordered the gray/green and really like it.It's true, it's not as dark with gray as I expected, but I don't think mine was completely void of the color.I'm torn about liking the fact that the top material ISN'T fabric like my old blanket.It makes it less comfy, BUT it also makes it more child-spill friendly.All told, good quality and value for the money.I do like this product but it wasn't what I was expecting.That's not to say the description is misleading, but I think I had it in my head that this was just a blanket with a waterproof backing.It's all made of a nylon/plasticky material.The top is silky but not fabric.The carrying pouch is handy too.We keep it in the car for times when we need a little stretch on the grass.We have the Cocoa Bubble pattern, which is quite cute.While I do like this, I wouldn't use it if we wanted a soft place to snuggle up for a long time, like watching an outdoor movie or something.The size is adequate for a few people to sit on it.The only down side is that it is a little small.We were looking for a nice multifunction blanket for beach, picnic, pool, etc.and found this.Our little girl loves playing on it, rolling around, working on crawling and getting dried off on it after a dip in the pool.this is pretty much a padded tarp with its own carrying case.it's convenient to use.it can fit in a standard washer, but only air dry it.No more sitting on towels, getting sand on them, setting them down next to each other etc.This is just wrapped and ready to go always, love it!I should have paid closer attention to the sizing thought, I just looked at the picture and it looked so big in the picture but in fact it's not that big.Two adults can sit on it with some of their stuff on it but that's it.If my husband and I use it and try to put our baby down on it it really isn't big enough.Just FYI.I cleaned it and it did not go away I was disgusted by it.i have no problem with this product.keeps my milk cool and fresh.This is really convenient & it fits my diaper bag.I'm using it all the time when we go out.I rarely write bad reviews, but I thought this product warranted it because of how short these monitors lasted!I'll start with the pros.PROS:1.I have the base unit on the third floor and was able to get reception in the cellar as well as across the street in our garage.The number of channels to choose from limited the amount of interference static.However no matter what channel we were on our cell phones managed to give annoying static and we were alerted by our baby monitor any time of text message was being sent or when one was coming in.3.There's two of them so you can switch out.The fact that there were two made this product last longer because when the first one no longer had reception we switched to the other on.4.The base unit and the monitors plug in.HOWEVER as another viewer mentioned, plugging your monitor in for more than 12 hours will fry the monitor.So if you forget to unplug your receiver, you've ruined the monitor.CONS:1.It was hard to avoid "bursts" when the unit was around our cell phones and by around I mean in the adjacent room.2.The pro of having the monitors have an A/C adapter become a con when you can't just leave the units plugged in.And not only can't you leave them plugged in, you destroy the product if you do.Why have an A/C adapter in the first place?!3.The monitors stopped getting reception after only one month of use!So while as a whole we were able to use the unit for a little over a month if both monitors had been in use at the same time we wouldn't have had that much time.In my book no matter how great the pros were/are, if the product only works for 1-2 months then the product is worthless.I love fisher-price but these monitors barely deserve one star.I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this monitor!!It really picks up the tiniest sounds - as I sit here writing this, I have the monitor volume turned down to half-strength, and I can hear the clock ticking in the nursery (which is on the opposite side of the room from the receiver and is not that loud in person).I would recommend this to ANY new mom - there is no need for a video monitor (you'll never watch it, or you'll spend WAAAAY too much time watching it) - this gives you the visual you want with the lights, and the sensitivity that you need to make sure your baby is safe and sound.When he could sit up on his own, I just let him sit in the bottom portion of the tub, where he could splash and play.We had a cheaper tub for the first month or so, and he was constantly sliding down the seat into the water, and freaking out.I put the baby bath in our actual tub and run the faucet the whole time she in - she loves the sound of the water.The sling allows for me to have the baby bath overflow and still be safe.To be honest, we haven't used the toothbrush yet, as our little guy has just started to get teeth...but he loves the heck out of the gum stimulator (see uploaded pic).He carries it around with him wherever he goes, and I'm almost tempted to buy a second one just as a backup!Product is fine, no complaints, but my toddler is not interested in using it at all.I do this like set.The only thing that bothers me is not knowing whether it is BPA free or not.I liked that it came with the toothbrush, a tooth massager and a fingerbrush.There are a few other things that bother me though...The tooth massager is almost like a stick and putting that in my babies mouth freaks me out.I'm sure it's definitely helping getting his teeth to come out of the gums but I'm afraid of him choking on it or hurting it in his mouth.I of course hold it but babies love to grab.The finger brushes is for cleaning gums and when they have teeth you go to the toothbrush.The bristles get in the way when I use the non-bristle side.It just seems this product was well intended but not fully thought out.This was the second type of nipple we tried with our daughter who is primarily breastfeed when we were starting bottles for daycare.She took to it right away and we haven't had any problems.The slow flow is just about perfect for her, she isn't drowning in milk and does have to do some active sucking just like when she is at the breast.I still regularly breastfeed the rest of the time.These are slightly different in color, have a blem next to the nipple hole(white colored blem, very similar to dried or stretched latex).Either R2D2 forgot to poke a hole into one of the two in the pack or quality control sucks.My 5 day old daughter almost drowned in breastmilk on her first suck with breastmilk flooding out of her mouth and went into a coughing fit.I spent 10 minutes listening to her coughing and belching louder than the guys on game night with my wife glaring at me as if it was my fault.Do yourself a favor, go to the store and buy these.At least that way, if you need to make a return, you don't have to pay the same amount in shipping as you did the item and end up screwed twice:#Cons:Daughter almost drowned in breastmilkDaughter went into an uncontrollable coughing fitDaugter spent 10 mins belching louder than I can fart#not sure if that's a con)Throwing this item away is cheaper than trying to return itWife gets mad at you cuz it's always your faultMother in law is mad at you for buying them onlineGrandmother in law is mad at you for buying them onlinePro:Daughter belches louder than the guysYou don't need to buy a water gunIf you ever need to make black smoke in a survival situation, you can burn itSomething to chew on when your out of gumMy 7 week old daughter is breastfed exclusively and I haven't been able to get her to take a bottle at all.I even went so far as to spend $10 on a single bottle (Avent) and it didn't work.Though she might if I left her with her daddy.Still, one step at a time..I didn't buy mine online because of reviews that recommended buying them from the store since they aren't the same when you order online, so I can't comment on the quality of the product if bought online.I found mine (nipples, nurser, and breast milk storage set) at Target and they were in perfect condition and work wonderfully.These latex nipples are the only ones my breastfeeding baby will take.We use it with the playtex original nurser which uses the drop-ins.We tried Dr Brown's, Breastflow, Nuk, and Medela bottles but he couldn't seem to latch onto the silicone nipples on those.I gave it 4 stars because the pack I received had one nipple that had melted a little which caused some of the cardboard packaging to stick to it.Boiling them doesn't seem to take it off.It super soft to avoid nipple confusion when breastfeeding as well.I've never had a problem with the quality.It remains my favorite feeding nipple.I recommend this to anyone currently breastfeeding who wants to teach their baby to take the bottle as well.I have a few packs of these bottles and I love them for storing my milk in the freezer-- 2.5oz containers, allow me to freeze with more peace of mind than the plastic bags that many others use.I've just heard too many stories about bags ripped/broken and milk loss.I work too hard to make it to see that happen!My only reasons for not giving these 5 stars:1) I wish they were bigger, but that's Medela's product team's issue, not Amazon's.2) The description on these says they're sterile, but I've gotten sterile ones that were individually shrink wrapped, and these were NOT.So I don't fully trust that description.Good product.Fit my medela swing pump so I save directly in fridge or freeze.When this package arrived, I was very disappointed to see "not for use with Single Deluxe or Freestyle breast pumps" written in very small print on the front of the package.I assumed that because the product was made by Medela and claimed to be "compatible with ALL Medela breast pumps," it would be compatible with my Medela Freestyle Breast pump.So far he loves the idea that he can sit or stand.and it's sitting in the nursery right now waiting on the little miss to get here.Since my daughter isn't here yet I added some weight to the car seat just to see how it would work with both the kids on there.Not quite one handed steering, but close!I decided on this one as opposed to the ultra light mostly due to the price.Granted the carseat adapter will have to come off to fit in the trunk (I have an '07 Fusion)), but that's an easy thing to do.But that shouldn't be too much of an issue as the sunshade on the stroller is adjustable.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the basket is a bit awkward to get to.In order to put anything there, I'll have to move my son if he's sitting.I was able to check the stroller at the plane door for both flights which was a necessity flying with two kids by myself.He hates being strapped in which is why I chose this over a double umbrella.I was worried he'd be constantly jumping on and off but no problem, he stays put.My 5 month old sits fine in the seat as long as you put the footrest in the straight out position to keep her from sliding forward too far.I just added a body support for herJJ Cole Collections Body Support, Khaki, 0-8 Monthsand it was definitely a good choice, keeps her from flopping over and having the seatbelt rub on her neck.Great stroller, highly recommended.-------------------------------------------------------My daughter is now an average sized 2 year old and is probably reaching the limits of sitting in the front seat, she still fits in there for now, but I don't imagine she will when she is 3.His head doesn't fit under the canopy when he's standing, but I think the canopy is really only meant for the kids while seated.We don't use this all the time, but I wouldn't dare to go for a day at the zoo without it!Really happy we have had this, it's a great product.I ended up selling it 2 weeks later.These aren't as thick as the Pee Wee pads, but at half the price, iy's a good deal.The descripyion left the size off: 13 x 9"These are not absorbent at all.They were a little pricey so I thought I would try these.I used maybe two and the rest are sitting in a drawer.Gross.We put them under our little guy for any last minute 'oops' messes.They fold up easily and we use these all the time at home.We use this with the KidCo G15 White Center Gateway with Walk Through Pressure Gate for the bottom of our steps.I was so happy to have found these two products!I would have given it 1 more star if it was not quite so expensive but highly reccomended to anyone in a similar situation.There's nothing that haven't been said about the product that other reviews hadn't covered.If you need it, get it, it works very well.I'm writing this review, and giving 5 stars to support a great product....I expected far better.This is a great space-saving, travel pack n play, but all that these 'sheets' are is an EXTREMELY thin pillowcase with the back ripped off.No, I'm not kidding...Oh and don't even remotely expect these 'sheets' to contain a blowout or pee... it goes right through to the pad.The sheets fit nicely, but they are not very soft at all.I wouldn't buy again.Product fit great - note that this is for the travel crib, not the full size one.The sage color is kind of ugly.Looks like an army green.I ordered two of these sheets.At the time they were the only sheets I could find that were made for the travel lite.When they came in I quickly put them to the test to see if they would fit.They are a little thin but I like having some thing on there so that my baby isnt laying directly on the pad.They are easy to clean and I havent had any problems with them.I think that they were worth what I spent.This was the first bathtub we bathed our newborn in when he was born almost three years ago.The Safety First Space Saver Fold Up Tub works great on a counter, in a sink or in a bathtub.The main down-side to this product is that I feel like the baby isn't covered with ENOUGH water to stay warm.I bought it to use when travelling and so far it has worked well.I place  it in bathtub or shower.My child is 4 months and did not hate this tub ( judging by the lack of screams).The baby did roll a bit from side to side, so I had a keep a hand on the baby at all times.But for a quick bath, the tub worked fine.I did not have a problem with fingers getting caught in the folding mechanism.The tub also dries pretty quickly.The price was great too ( I bought it at Walmart for half the price it sells for on Amazon.This is really a great product.My only problem is I don't have enough of them!!The lids close very tight and there is no ordor problem like other ice cube trays.I have had an excellent experience with this product.I started with one set of two and purchased a second set after two months.I highly recommend this product.Based on prior reviews, I have made sure always to run hot water over the tray to get out the food.Definitely the company has put out conflicting information about the amount in each cube.It's one ounce.They work well and clean up well by hand or in the dishwasher.I've now been using mine constantly for 8 months and they seem extremely durable.I don't know...it seems a little overrated for what it is.Hopefully this is just a phase she is going through.I'm a stay at home mom, but if you took your baby to day care it would probably be pretty handy if you use the KidCo system to leave food with them during the day.It ended up being kind of a waste for me.It didn't take long to see that a baseboard and shoe molding made installation problematic.I solved the problem by raising the gate an inch or so above the floor and installing the plastic sockets into which the gate extensions can rest.After setting the gate's length and locking the bar, it's just a matter of lifting the gate on and off the sockets attached to the wall.On the other entranceway I just extended the gate to full length and use pressure only to keep the gate in place.Using only the pressure of the bumpers to keep the door in place is a tedious operation.One of my coworkers, a mother of three small children, thinks her kids would easily figure out how to unlock one of these Supergates.For children I might look  look for other options.As an added footnote, I'm 5'10" and no spring chicken, yet have no difficulty simply stepping over the gate to access the blocked room.Our daughter now uses it during her nap in pre-school.Like a lot of previous reviewers, we started out with a more conventional high chair.I'd wanted to try a hook on chair before, but when you are a new mom and there are all of these images of standard high chairs everywhere it's difficult to consider other options.I bought the Chicco Caddy and brought it home.I can't understand why anyone would go with a standard high chair!We have taken the Chicco Caddy with us multiple times to friends' homes and restaurants as well.It is very easily portable and a cinch to attach to most any table.Minimal clean up, but still kind of an annoyance.He has plenty of room to move in the Caddy and will use it if not strapped in securely!Some users have complained about cleaning difficulty and I sympathize.A year after the initial purchase I am still happy with this product.We use it 2-3 times a day, and it travels with us often.Summer Infant Tiny Diner, GreenWe didn't care for this seat at all and will be returning it.It's very loose after it's assembled and would not attach securely to the table (our table fits all the specifications as being one that this chair can be used with).We tried this chicco chair because our fast chair does not fit our table.If it will fit your table or you're only planning on using it while traveling the inglesina is the way to go.I like that the chair seems very sturdy and unlike some other reviews I didn't have any problems attaching or detaching it from the table, however the bulkiness of it makes it more of a hassle as a travel high chair.I'm sure it would work great for taking to restaurants and using on basic tables, however for my own personal circumstances it's not the right product for me.I've ordered the Inglesina Fast Table Chair, so hopefully that will work better.The thing that I really didn't care for was that it was just bulky to carry around.I would totally recommend as a hook on chair used all the time at home, but not for carting around for travel due to the inconvenience of the size.The seller is great, very fast shipping and great communication.The shields are what they are supposed to be, but I wish they made even smaller sizes, as even this small one irritated my nipples a little bit due to friction.No pain because there's less friction.Lactation consultant in the hospital said she's never met anyone who didn't just need the 24 mm, so that's what I used the first 3 months and it HURT.About to give up, I read the sizing chart on the Medela website and discovered that I should be using these.They just fit better, and it doesn't hurt to pump anymore.(under my wife's direction) Having the right fitting breast shield makes a huge difference during pumping sessions.These worked like a charm with my hands-free unit.I had major trouble breastfeeding.It did fit with room around my nipple, but I found that the large shield helped me pump more milk.I think that the medela diagram is a little misleading, because when you pump the nipple expands, so I would reconmend going up a size, not down.Bought these after I discovered they existed.Was pumping with the original hard ones and was having a lot of rubbing and irritation.These things are a life saver.They are soft and comfortable for the mom who has to pump throughout the day.One drawback is that the thin rubber is wrinkling a bit with use.It crinkles as your pump works and now mine have perminent wrinkles in the material.This does not in any way detract from their comfort or usefulness, but it does catch milk in the pockets during pumping.Also, the rubber is turning a very light yellow brown after about 3 weeks of use.I wash them after every use and have put them on the top shelf of the dishwasher to clean even.Again, this does not detract from its use, it just looks dirty all the time.I highly recommend this for the ever-pumping mom.I like that it does stick to the skin when I pump because it helps prevent spills when I relax my arm a little while pumping.Very happy with this product and the shipping was very fast!If you use the pump alot, however, the parts tend to wear out a bit.(Just like anything else) They may get deformed if you place in the steam bags Medela provides, so I would recommend handwashing in hot water.Don't waste your time or money with this.I should have listened to the customers who wrote bad reviews on this product!I say I have a love/hate relationship with these because I love that I get more milk with these vs. the plastic hard shields, however, I hate these because they warp in about 3 weeks time.I've replaced these shields about 4 times now, since mid-January.I know that I can use the hard shields with the Freestyle, however, I get less milk when I use those vs. the soft shields.There are two problems with these shields.I've never put mine in the dishwasher nor the microwave to sterilize (as that will warp them faster), I've only used soap and water.So the more you pump, the faster they will warp.Once they warp, they lose suction and I pump significantly less milk.Then my milk supply goes down for several days.It's SO frustrating.Then I have to fork over more money to buy new ones again.Once I get the new ones, I'm able to pump more milk again.This is why I hate these shields.The other problem with the soft fit shields is that they only come in one size.When I had my baby, the lactation consultant measured me and gave me the 27 mm hard plastic shields (for use with the hospital rental pump that I was using at first).Most of the time it's bearable.However, because it's a tight fit for me, I sometimes get milk blisters from the friction, which can cause clogged ducts.I won't go back to using the hard shields though, because for some reason I don't get as much milk out when using those.So, I'm stuck with the Soft Fit.That is frustrating, as well.Get with it, Medela!!For that reason, I'm not happy with Medela.But the pump itself works great, so I stick with it.Overall, I give this 3 stars because like I said, I love and hate these at the same time.If you're pumping once or twice a day, you may not have the warping issue as much.But if you exclusively pump, as I do, be prepared to dish out lots of money to keep replacing the shields.And yes, you'll be annoyed, like me.Medela has great products - this shield simply doesn't do as much as the "hard" ones do.Sure, it is made of a flexible plastic sort of like a nipple to a bottle, so it sounds great and feels great to the fingers, but the down sides of actually using them are:* And most importantly, they don't express as much milk as the "hard" ones do* They sort of stick to you - so you have to THINK before removing them (insert finger in the side) so depending on when you are pumping and how sleep deprived you are, THINKING first doesn't always happen* Sure the "hard" ones leave a "ring around the rosy" but so do these soft ones since you have to turn up the vacuum pressure.I actually gave myself a sore spot from the edge rubbing back and forthThe ONLY thing I like these for (which is why I didn't give it a 1) is when I'm WAAAAAY past due to pump and I'm feeling like I've got rocks in my chest.I'm so glad that when I was in the hospital the nurse/lactation lady told me about the different types of breastshields.This one saved the day.They do wear out after a while of use because they are soft and give when pumping.I pumped for 10 months and had to buy several sets, but so worth it to me!I'll be buying these again for my next baby!These are much softer than the regular issue hard plastic shields.I put mine in the top rack of the dishwasher a few times, too and they distorted a little but it didn't really affect their use.I purchased several of these and used them constantly.Even now, at 7 months and over 29 inches, he still uses this for nap time and in the car, or just to wrap up with mommy on the couch.I would definitely recommend this product.The swaddling stage varies a lot from one baby to another.My baby liked to stretch her legs and arms, so she outgrew swaddling around two months.Some babies still like to swaddle at six months.Of course my baby had no issues with spitting up since she was breast fed, but one or two should do unless your baby has problems with spitting up and dirtying things quicker.For any new moms looking at packages of less expensive receiving blankets, you won't need them!Most receiving blankets are 30"X30", too small to swaddle a baby and useless as a blanket, plus they get really hard and wrinkly in the wash. Every mom I know agrees with me.Some people use them as burp rags or to sop up messes.A lot of experienced moms never open, but just regift them because they are so useless.To sum up: buy the Swaddle Designs blanket!Our infant liked being swaddled until she was older and longer.She was about 4 months old before we were able to stop swaddling her (but she was a long baby).So it has been one of the most versatile blankets and well used blankets we have had.This is a great baby gift for yourself or a friend, because those initial receiving blankets only work for about the first 4 weeks of life, and then it seems the baby outgrows them, so those seem like a waste to me now.No worries about loose blankets in the crib or baby being too cold.It is very well made, and so soft.We keep the temperature in our house at 72 degrees, which for me feels very cold in the winter.Rather than putting a space heater in our 2-month old's room, and risk overheating her, I put her in this sleepsack over her regular footed long-sleeve cotton pajamas.The pajamas alone were too cold, I would find her in the middle of the night with cold feet and hands.She is big for 2 months (13+ lbs) and the small fits her great, lots of room to grow still.For the first 3 months of my child's life she was swaddled at sleep time.Sometimes,she even perspires in them.The Halo Sleepsack is a fantastic alternative to piling on a bunch of blankets, especially since blankets at young ages can be unsafe (accidental suffocation).The only down side (my opinion) is the fleece material.Not crazy about fleece because it pills and looses some of it's original softness, but these are still worth it.This is really a great product.It was definitely a good buy.It is soft, even after several washing.In the summer I put the  baby to sleep in it in just a long sleeve cotton onesie.Once it statrted  getting colder, she sleeps in her footed pajamas.The sleep sack keeps her warm but not overheated.It's much better than having to put a step stool and a potty seat down everytime my daughter has to go, cuts down on the fumbling and the clutter.I've read some of the reviews about the elongated seat and so far I haven't had any issues.I put the Mommy's helper on top of the elongated toilet seat not on the bowl and it fits perfectly.I guess maybe some of the reviewer's have extremely elongated seats because I haven't had any stability issues at all.Also, for all you tall people out there, my daughter is 26 months and off the charts tall.I didn't know this going in but shopping for potty seats & step stool combos for tall kids is pretty difficult.You don't want to end up with their knees too far up or have the seat settle in such a way they can put their feet up and get pee everywhere.You also kind of want to avoid the dangling feet if you have a curious tot that needs to check out everything that comes out.BUT, I don't feel secure with her using it by herself.She has a hard time turning around on it once she climbs up and it is a little wobbly.I would get it again, just wish it had a few improvements like something that attached to the toilet itself or made it more stable.I decided to give this a quick update after writing my original post because I kept wondering how on earth this potty seat would chip a toilet as per the Top Post.The Top post on here gave this a 2 star review based on the fact that they were using it wrong.They say "It simply does not fit elongated toilet seats (I tried it on three different toilets with elongated seats)so it is always somewhat unstable, and this leads to chipping and damaging the toilet seat".This is NOT meant to be sat on the toilet seat, you lift up the toilet lid & seat and place it directly on the toilet(look at the picture) So I am also sure that is why they claim it was so unstable.Also, I have realized the reason the steps don't lock down is so it can easily adjust to different sizes/heights of toilets.I even tried to use this seat on our toilet side ways and it still works just fine so I think unless you have a really tall or weird toilet that this would work just fine...if you use it the correct way that is.I would just hate for people to pass up buying this based on the negative review(like I almost did) when they are giving a negative review based on using it wrong because I really believe this potty seat is the key to potty training my daughters in an easy and stress free manner.Original PostMy twin daughters just turned 2 on Oct 27.We have potty chairs and although they used to enjoy sitting on them I can normally not get them to sit on them for more than 10 seconds at a time.And although they have previously sat on the big potty with me holding them so they dont fall in, both my daughters had become Terrified to sit on the big potty.I was trying to decide on this with built in step stool or the Baby Bjorn toilet seat and after much debating I decided to go with the step stool so my girls could feel more independant.The first time using this both my girls were still showing their normal fear of the toilet so I had to pick them up and sit them(one at a time of course) up on the potty seat.They were still afraid until I showed them to hold onto the handles, the handles made a HUGE difference in calming their fear.And they were able to sit back on the cushy seat, and realize they were secure and not going to fall in the toilet even when they didn't hold on.I literally had to make them get off the potty so the other could get a turn.After that 1st time both my girls wanted to climb up the step themselves and I still had to help them get turned around and sitting on the potty and when they were done I had to help them get down.But that was only for the 1st couple of days and now both my girls can climb the step by themselves and get turned around and sitting on the seat and back down again all on their own.She is below the 5th% for both height & weight, she is 32" tall & 22lbs.My other daughter is a little over 34" & a little over 25lbs.PRO'S*My girls LOVE it*The seat is soft & comfy*The entire thing is easy to clean*The handles help them feel secure and in control*The seat opening is small & helps them feel secure(even my tiny daughter won't slip through)*The step helps them be independant & get on potty themselves*It is lightweight & easy to travel with or take to a different room*The seat folds flat so it is easy to store when not in use*It is affordable*You don't have to clean out a potty chair*Easy to assemble-no tools required*Step seems slip proof, my girls have gotten on this out of the bath, completely soaked and not slippedCON'S*The seat might not work for boys as well(I don't have a boy to know) the seat pictured isn't the one you get*The steps don't lock down so while they are sitting they can easily push on the handles and the steps fly up, if they get carried away the seat will wobble around.Also, if they push their weight on the handles when they are going to step down the handles will go down and the steps will come up so they could fall.But I think they may have done that so it can fit different toilet heights/sizes.Overall I would totally recommend this seat.Although the steps don't lock down I am always right there to ensure my girls do not get hurt and within a few days of use my girls have learned how to safely get up and down w/out any step problems.I have to keep our bathroom door shut now because my daughters would strip their diapers off and go sit on the potty by themselves but now with the door shut they come get me and drag me to go potty.They both go pee on the potty on a regular basis without me even having to ask them!Also, make sure to have some picture books, coloring books, sticker books or other fun things in there so that sitting on the potty is fun :) Don't put too much pressure on them either, my girls have done the best when I don't do much of anything and they can do it all themselves...ah, Mommys little girls are growing up..too fast(said as I wipe a tear)I was having no luck with potty training before this product and with the independance and security this seat has given them, they are now Potty Queens!!If you have any questions let me know and I will try to help you out : )I ordered it because my son had difficulty moving our large wooden step stool and the lightweight plastic one was not tall enough for him.When this arrived he used it right away and was so VERY excited that he could use the potty all by himself.Mommy and Daddy were pretty thrilled about that too!I was a little concerned about the construction; it didn't seem all that sturdy so I called the company to ask about a weight limit.The lady on the phone told me they didn't have one, but that she had stood on her son's bottom step and if we had any problems to call.Well, almost a year later, while putting this up, my son somehow cracked the bottom foot.By the end of the week, I had received a replacement and we are still using this seat!I am always impressed with companies that stand by their products.Our 3 year-old moves with caution when trying to use Mommy's Helper step up.That should tell you something.This product is probably not likely to collapse but it is very likely to give you a the feeling that it will.Again, will he really tumble off it?It's really a bit too small for our 35 pounder and he noticed that as well.Of course that much younger child would be an even poorer candidate for having to climb the steps-- so you might wind up putting them on the seat, defeating the point of the step (or at least most of the point).In the end I would be hard-pressed to say this is a great product.You would likely be better off buying a sturdy stool and a seat adapter (or whatever it is called) for your toilet and call it good.This thing is huge..didn't use it yet.Well, i guess it will fit lots of toys :)))Could never get this to stick on the wall, very disapointing.Spent a good amount of money on it and was never able to use it.We have used this in 3 different houses with the suction cup attachment and never had a problem with it falling off.We are careful not to put heavy toys or large bottles of liquids on it.He eagerly uses it to help us clean up the tub and rinse the toys too.We have been thrilled with this product.The toys dont get slimy from stiffing in standing water since all the water drains out.I do really like the Boon Frog.It does hold on pre-fab shower with smooth plastic walls, but will occasionally fall off- usually in the middle of the night, scarring you half to death.I love that the toys dry as they hang.I love that I can just scoop up the toys at the end of bath time, give them one quick rinse, and hang them up.It makes the end of bath time so much easier!It holds quite a few toys, but my three kids have quite a few toys, so they don't all fit in the Boon frog.It probably isn't the frog's fault.We really shouldn't have so many bath toys.I find the little shelf useless.We use Burt's Bees Baby Bee soap and there isn't a good way to set a bar of soap up there.I usually just stick a very small bottle of shampoo and conditioner up there for guest's use.The shelf isn't very big.I also don't find that the frog's toes work well for hanging things.It is difficult to get things on and off his toes.And if your hanging it by the suction cups, you've got to be careful not to pull it off the wall trying to get loofahs on and off the thing.All in all, it is a nice product and I would buy it again.This play mat just sucks.I returned it within the week.The fabric is cheap, the toys aren't anything special, and it isn't sturdy.Everytime he would bat at a toy the toy bar would come crashing down onto him, and he was playing very gently.I tried repeatedly to balance the mat and toy bar "just so" so that it wouldn't fall, to no avail.And the advertisement that you can attach the toy bar to the crib?It has alot more toys, collapses well too, and is ALOT better quality.So, for $15 dollars more, my son has a better quality toy that he can enjoy without getting bonked and me having to hold the toy bar up so it won't hit hom in the face.Unfortunately, when he bats or grabs onto the toys the whole bar tips over!We tried putting it into the crib and latching the velcro onto the bars, but it's just a little too short to latch both sides.So now we're stuck with a toy that baby loves, but requires someone to sit there and hold it in place.It's driving me insane!However, most of the characters are hard to squirt and pretty much impossible to get all of the water out.I had bought this at a store and didn't see the reviews until I was looking for a new bath toys :(The two stars are for being cute and having the hanging bag, which could be reuse for other bath toys.I'm 5'8" and it's tall enough that I don't get a backache pushing it.I like the option of using a three point of five point harness.I was really excited about this bib, but it has been a giant FAIL.The plastic strap that holds it on was secure at first, but became quickly misshapen and now is not secure at all.It stays on my daughter for about 30 seconds, at best.It's like she has a plastic wedge between her and the table.This infuriates her (understandably so) and then she just rips the bib off.What's good about the bib is that it's extremely easy to clean.If it stayed on, I suppose it would also catch a lot of food.But due to its design flaws, it's unusable.Tough but stiff.I may have problem trying to roll this up to carry out.TommeeTippee is softer, able to roll but its concave pelican bib may collapse during use.have not purchase combi which have similar too.After using a dozen cloth bibs and being disgusted with the stains on them (who has time for pretreating that many bibs a day?)I have never used anything else in-between it is hands down the best bib out there.So easy to clean, and although he figured out how to pull it off maybe about 3 months ago, he'll still keep it on.When he takes it off he's telling me he's done.I can't tell you how much money I have saved in laundry costs and replacing old, gross bibs.My 10 month old could pull these bibs off in .3 seconds.I wish I would have bought this cover months ago.It is easy to put on when the baby when carrying him around.I love that there is a hood that covers my babies head.There are times that it doesn't cover his arms.The cover is long enough to cover his long legs.We really like this carrier.We go for walks outside and he just goes right to sleep.We also use it around the house when he gets fussy.We have used this a few times, but not as much as we would have liked.We like to use it because our baby hates being put in her little snowsuit, so this this we can just snap it over her instead of bulking her up beforehand, and we are all happier.Convenient for sure, but a bit pricey - depends on the time of year, and how often you will use it.It folds up small and the cover can be removed and put in the washer.I thought we might want a full-size swing but we never ended up getting one.I thought the batteries would wear out too quickly but we only replaced them once.The music is adorable, we never tired of listening to it.Great product.My husband and I purchased this product in order to confine our small puppy when we need to leave her alone/unsupervised in the house.Unfortunately, once we unpacked the gate, it was very quickly apparent that this was not at all suitable for us.The product is flimsy and feels cheaply made and unlikely to withstand any sort of "harsh treatment" (such as, in our case, a puppy jumping against it).When at its widest extension, the gate is flimsy and looks unstable.Yes, I know this product is cheap and you get what you pay for --- but after attempting to secure it into the doorway, the wood has already become frayed and chipped due to the fastenings.Even with the low cost, I still expected better than this.The main reason why I will be returning this product back to Amazon is because it simply will not fit our standard sized doorway.We need something that can withstand an energetic puppy and also not fall over when our cat jumps onto it.This product failed to fulfil either of these functions - it falls over at the slightest touch and would never withstand the efforts of a puppy.Not recommended.Ours reclines, and is very useful for daytime naps around the home (and at grandma's).This is an absolutely great set for older babies and up.But for half a sandwich, and snacks like cut fruit, cheese, or crackers, it is perfect.I also think that for older than about 2, it might not be quite big enough for a meal-- my 17 month old cleans it out already with no trouble!I guess that's boys.:)  The lids are somewhat hard to get off, which I'm glad of for my toddler but might be a problem if an older child needed to be independent.I don't quite understand all the objections to the spoon-- the bowl is sort of flat, and wider than infant spoons, but really not so freakish and useless as you might expect from all the complaints here.As an added perk, the whole set is also a puzzle-- my son often spends as much time after lunch fitting the little containers into the big one as he did eating.I have a lot of bento lunch boxes, including the laptop lunchbox.It's small enough to carry around easy, but has enough room for lunch for both my toddler/pre-schooler, as well as an adult (with a sandwich outside of it).We have a few of them and use them every day.I put veggies and dip in them, yogurt, cottage cheese, fruit salad... you name it.The laptop lunchbox I bought was outrageous, there was only one cover for the container, and the plastic smelled like the food I put in it, but the smell never goes away.I'd agree with other reviewers that very juicy things can leak, but this isn't really a problem for me.I mostly use the box to pack up the boy's lunch for his care provider, and so the box gets tucked into the fridge upright, where it won't tip or spill.Packing his lunch in this excellent box is our solution.If we are going out and about with snacks, I just fill it with non-drippy things - waffle, fresh green beans, clementine segments, squash chunks, whatever.We're very happy with this product!As a previous reviewer said, the concept is great, but this product is lacking.The lids do not stay on, which makes for a disgusting mess in the diaper bag.Frustrated now, we only use it at home and don't bother with the useless lids.I regret buying it.My son has been chowing down on it since he was 3 months old and it is still unchipped (paint and wood).I think that maybe it was bad luck for these reviewers.It is a clip and a toy as well.Very durable and it does its purpose.I liked the product for its purpose, but it does take 15-20 mins for an 8 oz bottle to warm up mildly.So if they would of made it heat up in faster time, I would give this 5 stars.We bought this when my son was about 6 months old for a 16 hour car trip.Had we waited till the kid was screaming, that would have been a veeeerrrryyyy long 20 minutes.Make sure you read the instructions before using, so you know how to power it up.Also, watch out that it is wrapped around the bottle properly (so the coils are coming into contact with parts of the bottle that have liquid in them).We have used this warmer only a few times on road trips it does take a little bit of time - about 5-6 minutes to get the bottle warmed up as hot as our daughter likes it, but it works great.Time shoudl not be a problem if you know that baby will be wanting to eat soon and get prepared early!We wanted to have something in our bedroom for the first couple of months since I know there will be lots of late night feedings and what not.My husband had a really easy time setting it up.It was to heavy for me to lift right now.I am very pleased with the playard and can't wait to begin using it.It also arrived in about 5 days and I live overseas.I was very impressed.Most strollers have useless sunshades.I should know, I have 5 strollers and only the Quinny Buzz has a relatively decent sunshade.But even the Buzz isn't great for a sun phobe like me.and it still lets him see out and feel like part of the action.I got the black one and it took 2 months to receive, so that was a bummer.But hopefully Amazon got the supply figured out and you will not have to wait so long.It is especially good for when your baby gets heavier.I can't think of a single thing that I didn't like about this stroller.It is super light, it folds up really flat so we were able to throw it in our tiny trunk (stupid convertible purchased before we had a baby), it has cup holders, a little tray that held my keys and phone, the handle was tall enough for both my husband (6') and I (5'7"), the basket is roomy and easy to get to, the price is reasonable, it's super easy to operate, it felt sturdy, it steered smoothly...I'm totally serious, I can't think of any negatives, except that we can't use it anymore becuase we graduated to a full-size carseat.This one is definitely going into the "store for next baby" pile, not the "crap to give to Goodwill" pile.I bought the Snap n Go when we took our 2 month old to Miami.We wanted a cheap stroller to travel with, so we wouldn't mind if it got broken.We gate-checked it and had no problems.(Granted, we were lucky--we might have wanted a canvas bag to stick it in.)6 months later, it's been one of my favorite purchases.I use it every day for quick errands in town, trips to the mall, dinner in some restaurants, even in the grocery store--it's easier to push her in it than to lug her into the store and put her in a cart.I just carry my reusable bag and fill that with groceries.Especially at first, when she almost always fell asleep in the car, it was GREAT not having to wake her up--I'd just move her carseat into the Snap n Go, and she never noticed.I have not had any problems with durability, although it's clearly not meant for rough terrain!It can "stick" going over bumps or rough patches (some iced-over snow on a sidewalk, for instance)--but I'm not on those surfaces very often, and the convenience of the snap n go far outweighs the few moments when I have to shove it over a small obstruction.I also, now that my monstrously tall daughter is about to outgrow her infant seat, am very glad that I did not purchase one of the "travel systems."I'm looking for my "next snap-n-go"--the stroller that I will keep in the car and use for errands, plane trips, and the mall.I'm glad I'm not stuck with one of the strollers that comes with an infant seat--they seem to be either very bulky with the infant seat attached, or cheapish and plastic-y, or with other features that I've now realized I don't want, or without features that I've now realized I DO want.To keep at home, I have a heavy-duty, durable stroller with good suspension for walks around our neighborhood (no sidewalks, and some unpaved roads).I like the advice from the Baby Bargains book--get whatever car seat you want and the Snap n Go.Use those for a little bit while you figure out what you're going to be doing with your stroller, and then you can make a more informed decision.I thought my big Maclaren was going to be my stroller--until I had to lift it in and out of the car too many times.At the same time, I needed something pretty rugged for walks, so I just gave in and decided it was worth having two strollers for two purposes.The other two top purchases were a Hooter Hider (sounds crazy, but if you nurse your baby and don't want to sit at home or go into exile every two hours, it's a HUGE help) and a bouncy seat--it's what she sits in when I shower, or do anything, really, when she needs to be secured and I can't hold her.Good luck.I use this in combination with the Chicco Keyfit 30Chicco Keyfit 30 Infant Car Seat, Adventure.It makes those first trips out with the new baby so much easier for a first time mom.I go to run errands, take the carseat off the base and place in the Snap and Go, and the baby stays asleep.She is six months old and we still use the combination.I can fit a diaper bag, a purse, and things that need to be purchased or returned.We also use this for walks around the neighborhood (That's about all the exercise you get for awhile after the baby is born) and the cupholders and closed compartment on the handle are nice for drink, keys, pacifier, etc.This is one of my most used purchases, and so much less expensive than some of the other options out there.It also folds flat with one quick button and fold movement and fits in a fairly small trunk.She stayed in our room for a few months, then moved to a crib in her own room.We used a projector-style nightlight with the planets and this turtle to put her to bed, and then the turtle would eventually turn off, which worked well.We tried changing batteries:  rechargeable, alkaline, it didn't matter, it doesn't light up.I haven't tried to contact the company as I figure it'll be a good toy eventually for our daughter, but it seems the mechanism can eventually fry, fyi.My son is now 4 years old, and it is part of his nightly "routine" to have the turtle on.It is very durable,lights up the room well, and is not too bright.I also like how it automatically turns itself off, and lets you choose the color of the light.A great buy, and I plan on buying another when our baby decides he wants one as well!It is a great way to create the same ambiance we have at home even when we are thousands of miles away from home.It was such a hit with my friends' children during our vacation that I now buy it as a gift for every child I know.Her's dimmed and died all in one night.I thought the batteries died but it turned out that a battery leaked.I cleaned it and changed the batteries but it didn't work anymore.The only issue we have had is that the fabric keeps separating from the shell of the turtle and it is not particularly easy to reattach it (I find gorilla glue works fairly well for this).They share a room that is 10'X10' (small) with standard height ceiling and the stars show up well no matter what level the turtle is placed at (on bed, dresser, etc.).Here is the reason I gave Twilight Turtle only 4 stars:  We got him January 2010.The batteries he came with lasted quite awhile.I could see through the holes that the amber light was on, but not projecting and the blue and green were not coming on at all.We were so sad.I kept putting off dealing with it, but continued to be sad about not being able to use the turtle.Last week I finally decided to try to contact the manufacturer, Cloud B.  I contacted them via email.They responded very promptly and gave me a list of suggestions about what could be causing the issue.The issue turned out to be that I had put in Energizer batteries.Apparently Energizer and Kirkland signature brand batteries in particular have a very short "neck" or connector point.Cloud B suggested using Rayovac.I immediately went out and got Rayovac batteries and our Twilight Turtle is back!I am so glad I decided to contact Cloud B and figure this out.Otherwise, sad to say, he would have been tossed.I feel that Cloud B should have made it known about the battery issue from the beginning, but they really did have great customer service.I was so excited to get my baby girl this lady bug star night light and it was everything I hoped it would be.Very cute.my daughter begged and begged for this.at first i kept saying no because $32 plus tax is pretty expensive in my opinion.but i finally caved and let her buy it.she was able to test it out at the store and had a hard time choosing between the bluish/green one and the greenish/brown one.she finally decided on the greenish/brown because it had more stars on it.the newer blue/green one had less stars due to the fact that it had endangered animal buttons on it that light up (but doesn't show on ceiling).one thing super cool about the blue/green one is that it lets you light up both green and blue stars at the same time.while the green/brown one lets you do amber, green and blue...BUT separately.turns off in 45 minutes.only thing missing is some soothing noises/music to come w/ it.has 3 different color modes.found same product in stores but at least no sales tax and shipped to home.very soft and cute.only bad thing is that it turns off after 15-30 minutes, would like it if it stayed on all night.They are 3 months and 18 months.There is something magical about staring at the stars in your bedroom and my kids and babies absolutely adore this product.I would recommend this for any age child (and secretly, I think this would be a neat thing to have in my own room, shhh... don't tell my kids!)It really is calming and interesting for little ones to stare at as they drift off to sleep.I ordered the ladybug new and directly from Amazon.com.My boys love playing with this at night.A fun toy and useful night light.Had no problems seeing the auburn like some people...depends on how much darkness is in the room.Breakable?You'd have to try pretty hard.He was crying because he wanted to go home, really he was just scared, anyway I pulled the Turtle out and turn it on and the other kids thought it was soo cool this got my son to stop crying and he was happy being there with it.Made that night, and many other nights very peaceful.It is super lightweight - about the same as a regular stuffed animal.However, it has a hard shell with star shaped holes which project light onto the ceiling and walls.There is an on-off button on the battery compartment, so you can turn it completely off as desired.It comes with a star guide, so you can look for the constellations that they've replicated with the light patterns - my daughter loves doing this.As previous reviewers comment, the blue is by far the nicest color.I also read somewhere that blue light can enhance sleep, so there's another reason to select the blue color.The turtle-light will project the stars onto the walls and ceiling for 45 minutes then automatically turns off.It is just bright enough to allow low vision in the room, which helps my daughter not be scared, but it's not so bright that it hinders sleep - it's just right.The light effect is so pleasant and the turtle so lightweight that I'm considering taking this with us on an upcoming 3 week international vacation.The only thing that could make this light better would be the possibility of selecting longer time periods for the light to be on (such as all night)and the option of plugging it in if so desired.i'm considering buying a second one of these so that both her bedroom and ours can have stars at night.It would also be great to use for star effects if having an evening party or gathering with low lighting (just a thought...)Great night light.I saw this and had to get it for my daughters room.Well she is 10 months now and we are on our third one...this is not a good thing.The first one we got shorted itself out and we tried to fix it but forget it...also we must have gotten an older version because the second I bought was awesome- was so much brighter and you could make out the stars.The second one did not last very long and this one sucked down batteries and again shorted out with in two months.We received one as a gift for christmas- which was fine...so far it's worked but still sucking down batteries.I was kind of surprised that the shell was hard plastic, but that's the result of me not reading through the product description thoroughly enough.The rest of the lady bug is soft plush.The stars are a nice effect at night, although the red setting is only very visible in very dark conditions (the blue and green show up just fine though).The stars (and crescent moon) are stationary and you can make out some constellations in it (a fact pointed out by our 11 year old).The little one really isn't old enough to enjoy it yet, but my wife and I love it and the eleven year old is particularly taken with it (he's asking for his own).We use this as part of the night time ritual in that we turn on the Cloud b Twilight Turtle, Turn on the Cloud b Sleep Sheep and put her to bed.She's now one month old and is sleeping up to five hours a night.We started this routine after one week and I give credit to these items for helping with this.I got this for my daughter when we were having a new baby since they'd be sharing a room and my daughter always kept a light on.This was one of the best kids' purchases I've made in a while.Our fave is purple.My daughter usually has to press it once more before falling asleep.The stars don't move.Where are you people getting your info?It's not supposed to.It is the best nightlight ever.The baby, now a toddler, fell in love with it, so here I am buying our second.My daughter's friend has the turtle at home and since she saw our ladybug has been bugging her mom for one.This is a sure winner with ages baby - 10.Every night, she goes to sleep by playing with it.This is one of this products that grow with your child and a highly recommend it.When we bought it, with an infant in mine, I was not sure if it was the right choice because it didn't have music.She had music in another thing that she had in the bed, and she ended up enjoying that a lot, so it turned into an advantage.Light on one thing, music on another.It is really cute and soft.But since she is more independent, she just loves this toy.She learned to turn it off, in the turtle's belly, and to turn it on on the shell.Batteries last, by the way.Of course, we have changed them several times, but we forget in between, so it is pretty durable.The constellations part we haven't used.Maybe in the future, though I am sure I lost the booklet, but I don't think it is the best thing of this toy.She loves all the stars and tries to "grab" them.The amber doesn't show up too well, and the green is kind of bright.We usually use blue, which is really pretty.I would recommend this as a gift for any child.I bought it since I am morally against ferberizing kids and our 8 month old son had still not learned to sleep by himself .. though its very nice product by itself our expectation from it probably were unrealistic so want to caution parents who might be in the same boat .. infants would like the stars studded ceiling but after a while they get used to it and don't find it as fascinating .. our son likes it but its not enough to make him sleep while star gazing .. if the stars could rotate slightly that might have done the trick but with the still appearance its just not enough .. YMMV.The price is great and kept my daughter entertained for short periods of time.Easy to buy and change out the little attached toys those are kinda expensive thou.loves to jump in it even at 17 months.We have not had problems with it at all, and its very easy to assemble.Held our kids attentions for a long time and its cute to see them bouncing up and down in the seat!I would not pay the asking price on Amazon for it, but since we purchased it almost four years ago we paid about half of what they are asking now!I found the American Baby Sheets and Mattress pads very small for the mattress that actually comes with the pack n play, and extremely thin.So I'm off to buy the actual Graco version in the hope s that it will be a better fit.A good solid product for the money.We travel with our baby frequently and I was looking for a mattress cover that had some padding to make the PnP more comfortable for baby, as well as protecting the mattress from any leaks or spit up.The Graco PnP mattresses fold accordion style and when you stretch this over the mattress, it's going to fold up (hello...tight elastic stretched over something that bends...common sense!), but when you stretch it out in your PnP (where it should fit snugly) it will not make the mattress fold up.It fits very snugly over the mattress and even bulks up the mattress a tad making it an even more snug fit into the PnP.Our baby loves it and is just as comfortable in her PnP when traveling as she is at home in her crib.I also highly recommend the American Baby Company cotton jersey porta-crib sheets to go with this!They are still usable, but its a bit disappointing.Liked the pillow during my pregnancy, but what do I do with it now?LOLthe pillow does take up a good portion of a queen bed :)super easy to put together, doesn't leak, my baby loves it, and you can see the drink level.Wouldpick this over the playtex anytime.That was my review  from a few months ago, have the following response in the comments too.Thought it would be good to update my review.and marked down these cups to 3 from 5 stars for the durability problem.But I guess we pay $4 for a cup of coffee that we throw away :-)  but since my kids like it better than the playtex cups, I get to buy a few more.the straw is much wider than the playtex cup so its easier for one of my twins to drink from it and he is not able to deal with the playtex cup as easily.The straw does seem to be closed with a bite to open type of mechanism but not too sure.On the other hand, I would now revise my review to many fewer stars -- this cup breaks when dropped and two of four cups I bought have already broken whereas the playtex cups keep going strong even if the straw wears out.wish they made them more durable.The cover I got is a low quality one.The fabric is harsh and covered in lint balls.The stiching is porrly made as well.I'm glad I didn't pay full price for this, but still upset about this purchase.I was rather disappointed with this when I received it.Well, the material is not as soft as I had expected and is somewhat thin.However, what I hate about it is there are two small holes in the center of it for those dumb changing pad straps to fit through.So, now you can see the white changing pad through those two holes and to the average Joe it looks like I have an old ratty changing pad cover that I should replace.My husband installed the gate with no problems, although we did use larger screws than the ones that came with it, and we made sure it was screwed into a stud.My two-year-old cannot unlock this gate, but his 6-year-old cousin was able to, which is fine because a 6-year-old won't fall down the stairs!We had the problem of a gap in between the gate and the top stair just because of the location of the stud, but the gap is not large enough to crawl through or get stuck in.We also purchased the accompanying kit that connects the gate to a wooden banister, preventing damage.I can understand making the banister mount an optional kit (k12), but I don't understand why they made the drywall installation kit (k100) optional.After getting the banister piece mounted, I found that I had to drive back to the store to get the drywall kit.Big pain.Because this required 3 separate kits, I had to juggle 3 separate sets of instructions to put this together.In one case the spacing on the template was roughly 1/8 inch (3mm) wider (or was it narrower?)UPDATE 1/11/11 We still love these gates.We are thinking of adding a Pool Gate Alarm to alert us if the gate is accidentally left open.These KidCo gates are sturdy and simple.There's very little that could break on these gates.This sounds like an installation error.You never want to crank a screw into plastic as hard as you can turn it or as hard as a power screwdriver will turn the screws.The screws should be tight and secure, but not tightened to an extreme level.I love the fact that the entire gate swings open, that makes it easy to get through the opening.We have other gates that have built in doors, and they're much harder to walk though while you are holding things (or babies).The latching mechanism on these gates is easy to use, but it does not close automatically.If automatic closing is important to you, pick another gate.Installation was easy for me, but I do major home renovations myself.It seems like anyone could do it without problems as long as they took care in using the included templates.Note that the gate can be installed without extra hardware in locations that are not quite straight openings.This results because one side is on hinges that fully swivel, so the gate can rest at an angle that is not perpendicular to the wall.The latch side must be perpendicular to the wall.As a final aside, I'm not sure why people are afraid to drill holes into drywall or a wood banister.Using the included screws and drilling into wood, you'd be left with a hole that's about 1/8" or less.When you take the gate down, invest $3 in wood putty that matches your banister and you can fix the hole in a matter of seconds.Drywall takes marginally longer to fix with some spackle and paint, but it's still quick and easy.Filling in holes is much easier than fixing dents created by pressure mounted gates.This is the swaddle we prefer for our baby, she is about 13.5 pounds.She usually cannot get out of it although sometimes she gets one arm out through the neck.The only issue we have had is that when we first bought it the velcro was almost TOO sticky, and in only about a week it didn't seem quite sticky enough but it still works because there is so much of it.We prefer the fleece swaddles because the cotton ones stretch and do not seem to fit our baby correctly.I used the Halo Swaddle Sleep Sack with my third daughter and wish I had it for the other 2.I love mine!This product has a major flaw for a baby that likes swaddling: their legs aren't swaddled!Having the legs "loose" while the arms are swaddled doesn't make much sense to me now that we've had a little experience.I give this sleep sack to everyone having a baby.This is good if the a baby decides they don't like being swaddled, you can just have the sleep sack and if they outgrow the sack part, or the season changes and you want them in less layers but they still want to be swaddled, you can use the swaddle wrap on its own.I also like the fact that the zipper zips from top to bottom, so the zipper pull isn't up at the baby's face.My daughter was growing out of swaddles like crazy around 4 1/2 5 months because she was long, but then I saw the length on the Halo sleep sack and it really is long.We were getting into spring so it was just too hot.the biggest problem was that if you have a baby that needs to be swaddled at night, they probably need to be swaddled for naps too and I just couldnt put this on my daughter on top of her clothes and changing her for every nap....yea right!Anyways what I eventually did was take the arm swaddle and use it without the sack.It worked for my daughter for awhile if we would put it really low and tight.Anyways I thank God she is done with swaddles now, but I sure spent a lot of money on them for those 5 months!I received my first one from the hospital where I gave birth and fell in love with it.She cannot wiggle out of this and it helps her feel secure so she can sleep at night.The only downside that it can't be used on a hot summer night.These sleepsacks are the best out there.In his first 3-4 months, our little one slept best when swaddled.The built-in swaddle feature made night-time changes and feeds so much easier.Also, the sleepsack itself tends to bunch up around the neck.As our baby grew, we were looking for a sleep sack that still had a swaddle.These Halo sacks worked perfectly.There is even Velcro straps at the bottom of the swaddle part that keeps it anchored down, preventing it from creeping up towards the baby's head.Once our baby transitioned away from being swaddled, the swaddle "wings" were removable and now we just use the sack by itself for putting our baby to sleep.The fleece is very soft and durable after many machine washings.Halo sleep sacks are the best.First off their zipper is opposite of most - making diaper changes much much easier.Plus I love that the swaddle can be removed.When my little guy was younger he liked being swaddled and now sleeps better with his arms free.We removed the swaddler part and are just using the sleep sack.I was skeptical with how great this product can be.My son, who turns 3 in 2 months LOVES this product.He is able to put all the pizzles together and was entertained by it.He actually sat for about 45 minutes putting them together, placing them all in the bucket and then putting them together again.I let it dripdry after washing.don't think it will survive a dryer well.I'll order a other one for when this one is worn out.I ordered them for myself though.I wanted some plain white wash clothes to wash my face every night and using these, they have fit the bill!I love that they are thin!Also with it being so thin it is easy to clean out your ears too.I plan to order more since I am pregnant and know my baby girl will benefit from these too.I love how thin they are.I have noticed they seem to stain easily.Close to two years and I have only bought two sets total and use one or two a day.Not bad!I was really impressed with this product.Having read some of the other "iffy" reviews, I wasn't expecting much.In reality, the mirror is large enough to see not only the baby's face, but also the surroundings.It mounted very nicely to the side of our Pathfinder headrest, and the tilt mechanism allows for easy angle view.(Note: You do need a headrest that can lift up so that you can attach the mirror with straps.If yours is a one-piece construction with the seat back, you won't be able to attach the mirror.I am out of luck with our other car...Just as the title states, that my main problem with this mirror.Has decent attachments for head rests, but for those of us that have the carseat in the middle of the backseat without a headrest to attach it to, this has to be rigged some how.The way we rigged it makes it shift from side to side with every turn the car takes and so I often have to lean to look in the mirror to see the baby.Wish there were a better mirror out there for this challenge...The black powder on the back of the mirror I received got all over my new seats.Be careful of that if you decide to purchase this mirror.I had no idea what mattress to get, they all look the same!I'm so glad I did.This seems well made and like it will last.The outside is vinyl looking (waterproof looking) but has ringed holes around it.It makes it really easy to change the sheets.This mattress is also firm, which I made an issue of finding a mattress that had good reviews of this (and I researched quite a bit).Easy to change sheets.I really hate spring mattresses so this is a nice alternative.Our newborn sleeps like a champ!It's a little firm, but that is how they're supposed to be for babies.It is very lightweight making changing the sheet much easier!I would recommend this mattress!I first want to thank Amazon for offering this product with APO shipping!I live overseas with the military and we've had nothing but trouble tring to get our baby gear (it's our first, so we have aboslutely nothing to start with).Secondly, I must thank the other reviewers - especially those who've had this mattress for a while or are purchasing 2nd and 3rd ones.Thank you for sharing your feedback!I've only had the mattress for a few days and we're still waiting for the baby to arrive, so we've not put it to use yet, but Amazon was able to ship the item to our APO box in about six days!pregnant).The square shape left no gaps.I will be recommending this to any of my friends.These are durable, and hold up well in the dishwasher.We've tried similar "straw through lid" type cups only to have a mess of leaks, and flimsy straws.The Take and Toss cups beat them all - the straws are made of fairly hard plastic, and they go in smoothly and tightly through the lid of the cup.She likes to chew on the straw, but they're significant enough that it's easy to squeeze them back to almost normal.They work very well and don't leak unless she holds them upside down and shakes, but that's understandable.The only drawback is the fact that they aren't vented (which is why they don't leak).By not being vented, when you pop the top on, the liquid will sometimes stream out of the straw for a few seconds.It doesn't spill and is inexpensive.Even though it's dishwasher safe, I hand wash these or anything plastic so that toxins aren't released in the high heated dishwasher and it lets the sippy cup look newer for a longer period of time.I was excited to see that it comes with a snap on "travel cover" that covers the mouth piece of the top and helps avoid spills.But I was disappointed that when my daughter was trying to drink from them it seemed like she was having a difficult time getting the liquid out.I tried it and you have to suck really hard to get any out.But for Take & Toss these were alright.The lids stay on tightly and the liquid inside is easy enough for kids to drink out of.There are no valves to clean, the cup itself is easy to clean, and the optional caps are great for capping the cup while in a bag.This cup, however is not completely leak proof when on its side, and if you have kids who shake the cup while it's upside down, you will have drops of liquid coming out of the cup.Having Mickey Mouse and friends on the cup is an added bonus; our kids will drink anything out of these cups as long as Mickey Mouse in on it!^_^That said, this cup is probably not the best for beginning cup users or kids who still like to throw cups around, but are great for those who are just trying to learn how to walk around with a drink, or who are transitioning from a sippy cup to a conventional cup.I like this product but i wonder if you can use a 99 cent microwavable container for the same purpose; what is the steam for anyway if you are microwaving the items and killing the germs.Tha being said, I wouldn't buy anything more expensive than this for the same purpose.The only thing that would have enhanced this product would have been some side handles.Because they are nontoxic, there is no coating on these blocks, but even with her drooling on them I haven't noticed much change, except maybe the wood is a tad darker.It's very hard to notice.Five months later, she still loves stacking them, knocking them down and putting them in containers.Very high quality!The wood does not splinter and the paint is very durable.My daughter loves to stack and knock over multiples times.Definitly recommend for any child!This is a timeless toy that I hope to have one day for my grandchildren!Those things take up so much space!This space saver highchair just sits on an old folding chair we have.Then, when we started feeding him, he was already used to the chair and liked it.I have wished the tray was a little smaller and had a removable liner type thing, but those things are no big deal.The wipeable seat cover is definitely better than the older type that are just fabric and get filthy.Also the height it awkward and the arms of the chair sit right at the table so you can't push the chair under the table.The chair can't recline either which isn't very helpful with an infant.Maybe it's just my table?!This seat also let him hang out with me in the kitchen.We live in an older home with limited storage space.I didn't like the idea of a full highchair that would take up lots of room either in the dining room or stored when not in use.One thing that I didn't realize would be such an asset, is that it is easy to transport (to grandma's house mostly) and that makes life much easier.The chair is basic, but has everything that you need.The seat reclines to help support little babies who are just able to sit supported and then tilts more upright as your child can sit more independently.The tray is dishwasher safe (woo hoo), and the cover is easy to clean.It's also a great value in terms of the amount of use it gets for a relatively low cost.If I had any complaints, it's that there were limited patterns when I purchased this.(We tried others before this and they were very flimsy) For the price this cannot be beat!We take it everywhere we go, the mall, playdates and of course long car rides and vacation.Great product and I highly recommend it!We now own a couple and use them at home as well.Which I can see as only a problem if you are sliding your child's bum around on it, may be uncomfortable.I checked mine didn't seem sharp at all.I would totally buy it again.Plus for around $9.00 this has made our life SO much easier then worrying about my son falling in the toilet...We have a more "oval" shaped toilet bowl and the seat fit quite awkwardly, even when placed at the front of the toilet.The picture on the box makes it appear that it covers most of the toilet and that is simply not the case at least with the oval, not round, toilets.Got it "in place" as best I could and it started to slide under my son.So, I lifted the toilet seat and placed the PRIMO seat directly on the toilet.A much better fit.Placed my son again and he was content to sit there for a while.I don't think it will snap, but I foresee having to stoop down next to him to provide added stability.I'm not keen on the idea of having to place the seat directly on the bowl in a public place... my own bathroom was one thing!For that reason, this item will see little use, save at Grandma or Auntie's house.Also, a few more pounds and I don't think my kiddo will be able to safely use it.If your child is less than 30 pounds and/or you think you'll be using it on "round" toilets most of the time, you could give it a shot.In my situation, I doubt I'd buy it again, but perhaps I'll feel differently after trying it on another toilet.I'll update this review in a few weeks.The storage bag it comes with is just a large zip lock style bag so I'm going to be looking into a cloth wet bag to store this in instead so I can wash it when needed :)I have been using this daily for my newborn since he was a few weeks old and he is over three months old now.Wanted a better way of bathing my kids together without breaking my back of the baby in the bathtub.Its plastic so you can dry it off, nothing to get moldy.Easy to clean.He is 3 1/2 months now and about 14lbs and we are still using it.Must have, esp if you have more than one child to bathe.We have to use it in our bath tub, instead of the sink, however, as it doesn't fit in our split kitchen sink, but few infant tubs would.Pros:-Great positioning of even a tiny baby.As baby grows, it continues to fit quite well.Plus, the seat on this can be placed on a normal flushing toilet once they become larger.Also serves as a useful backup when traveling and there are no rest stops nearby.Cleaning of these toilets is easy and they reassemble in seconds.So I ordered one of these.Honestly, I prefer the Graco one, which is a little cheaper.They are VERY similar.The main body is nearly identical.Pros - can be totally taken apart and cleaned and reassembled.Pee shield does not come off, so nothing to lose.Generous size for bigger kids.Cons - Handles feel flimsy.I guess it kind of keeps it together more but I would prefer one set of solid handles, as the Graco has.Seat is NOT soft - I was expecting a padded seat but this is not, it's just a layer of rubbery stuff.Granted, I personally can't stand padded toilet seats myself but the Graco has a soft seat, my kids seem to like it, I was expecting this to have a SOFT seat, and it does not.It also has no skid protection - the Graco came with little rubber feet you could put on so this doesn't slide all over, but this does not.This will do for our purposes, but save yourself a few bucks and get the Graco one.I wish I had just stuck with what I knew.editing this to say - the seat on our old Graco potty was ripped a little (it had a padded seat) and one of my girls decided to peel the cover off.Totally nasty inside!!!We have ordered a new seat from graco but now I find myself thinking, though it doesn't seem as comfy, this Primo seat really might be the better way to go as you will never have THAT problem with it.Nothing to rip and wear out over time.Esp the one with the little pop up person.Wow, I am surprised at all the negative reviews on here.And the tub itself is comfy (cushy inflatable lining instead of hard plastic) and relatively deep, so it keeps baby warmer in the bath and is more fun to play in!All the other baby tubs are small and shallow and more quickly outgrown.The main reason why we bought it was to save space, but what we found is it really didn't save all that much space.It does not have a little compartment to hold your shampoo and soap, so you  have to reach outside the tub and turn your head away from the baby.I received this bath as a gift and was excited.However there are a few problems with it that would make me not want to purchase it.1st, it is very slick and he is constantly sliding down the inclined side of the tub.Which just means you have to hold him the whole time, which can be very awkward because of where the sides are.I would imagine when he masters sitting the tub will work okay again, but by then we can just use the big tub.It will help when traveling though.So to conclude it works, but I think there are better buys out there.It says on the packaging that it is 27 in x 37 in, which would just fit the mattress board of myGraco Pack 'n Play Little Hoot.I tried putting it on before washing, and as I suspected, it was a super tight fit, causing the board to buckle in the middle.Since there were some positive reviews and successes with this product, I thought I would give it a shot and wash it in cold water, gentle cycle, followed by air drying it.Now the product has shrunk a tiny bit more, causing the board to buckle in several places, not just in the middle.In terms of dimensions, it's totally misleading and definitely doesn't fit every Pack n Play.It's very soft, very cushy, is organic and waterproof.It has all the things I'm looking for to provide my little one with something safe and waterproof to sleep on during the early days when he's in the bassinet portion of his Pack n Play.I can't seem to find anything else that is an equivalent product to this for that purpose, so I guess I am keeping it and hoping that the buckling will eventually lessen as I stretch out the mattress pad.It fits our 8 oz.The reason why I took one star away is because there have been a few times where I clipped it to the stroller and it unsnapped and fell to the ground.It's safer to just stick it in the diaper bag.We use this when we are going out with a bottle of refrigerated  breastmilk.It keeps it cool for hours so if I have an opportunity to feed baby from the source at one feeding, the bottle is still fresh at the next feeding.many plus' to the diaper champ; can use regular trash bags, does not give off an odor, at least not yet and we have been using it for 2 months, and its sturdy.We can go a whole week without emptying it, so far with a 2 mo old, which i find pretty impressive myself.Really its a good product, promise!I went with Diaper Champ, mainly because of the refill cartridge issue.I would recommend, though, that you use a strong bag, because it holds quite a few diapers if you fold them up good.You have to be careful to not throw anything other than diapers in, because some things (like individual baby wipes) will get stuck.I have concerns about the odor issue I've seen in reviews.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it stays that way going forward.I've found that I can use the same wipe all day, saving me money and time.I usually use a napkin to wipe off any drips and then the wet wipe to clean the various pieces.I thought these would be a waste of money, but since a free pack came with my pump, I kept them.In fact, I always wipe them down with these.We bought this for my daughter when she turned 4 months old.Once she got the hang of how to jump she started smashing her face in the doorway.If your baby is just going to sit there and hang out it's a great product but if your baby wants to jump at all it is not a safe baby product.I can't use it with my daughter because she gets hurt even with me sitting right there with her.The spring was too tight so there is no "jump" in the Johnny Jump Up.At 4 months, the basket was way too big for him, he could only get one arm over the bar, and the other was tucked inside because he couldn't reach the other side.He just chewed on the bar, and thats the most entertainment he got out of it.When he did try to jump, if only one of his feet touched the ground, it would spin out of control.We got this for our six month old who rolls everywhere.We have an open plan apartment so it's great to put her in while I do chores.she can't sit up yet and the part that the baby sits in is quite big so she can slump in it a little.We're still waiting for her to realize that she can jump in it.It wasn't too tough to put together but it took a bit of fiddling... basically if you're on a budget this is a simple cheap  solution.She doesn't jump in it yet, but she does love to swing and twirl around and her favorite time to use this is when I am cooking dinner or cleaning the kitchen.She would much rather be in this and watch me or play with the dog as it runs by, than stuck in her highchair or playing by herself in the living room.The spring is a little stiff, but I think once baby starts jumping, it will loosen up.Though pink and cute, this thing never seemed to work quite right.The baby wasn't stable in it -- she would flop over forward.While that never happened, she'd get burn marks on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself.Ouch...An annoyance: I had to get help to clamp it into doorways; couldn't attach & detach it myself.It just didn't work for us.By way of comparison: our favorite jumper was the Graco Bumper Jumper.My daughter is about 42" tall and 42 lbs, and this seat fits her perfectly.We just bought this toddler toilet seat in pink and white at Target.It was the comfiest looking one there.She was already about 75% potty trained using a stand-alone toddler pottySafety 1St Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty, but I was getting a bit tired of cleaning it out all the time, so I decided to buy this.The only downside is it did not fit on our standard size toilet seat (about 1/2" too big), so I had to go back to Target and buy a slightly larger adult toilet seat with brushed nickel hardware.(Yes, I could have just bought a smaller toddler seat, but they all looked cheap and uncomfortable.)I don't see how it could move around or slide off.My daughter uses a step stool to get up onto the adult toilet (she's tall for her age, so this goes smoothly- no adult help needed).We always clean it after each use, even if I don't see pee on it.I am not sure if it collects pee when boys use it, but for a girl, there have been no issues with it getting soaked in pee or hard to clean off.I am considering getting one for my parents house, too.The only downside is that I wish they had sized the plastic supports to fit all standard toilet seats (or made them adjustable).I had to take the Munchkin seat with me to Target and rip open toilet seats in the store to find one it did fit (sorry, Target!)This is a great cover for the pak n play mattress.It is super soft.It cleans easily and has not shrunk after two washes, along with drying on hot.It adds some cushioning to our used pak n play without being too much to make it unsafe.I just ordered a second one.I don't imagine I'd use it in warmer weather, but for winter, it's awesome.No pilling problems so far; I dry it on medium-low.I needed bibs that did not soak through to my teething baby's shirt.These are THIN, but EFFECTIVE.There is a middle layer of plastic, but both sides are terry so it's soft.They never soak through, and are worth the money.I save all of our other bibs for eating (fruits & veggies make a mess!)then I take them off and put one of these on for play time, they last throughout the day.These will be one of the things I give at baby showers from now on!These bibs are really inexpensive and have a waterproof liner.The bibs are absorbant and they can keep my baby's clothes from getting soaked.But I can go a lot longer between bib changes with these bibs compared to regular bibs.My baby is a little droll machine and I am on here to buy antoher package of these bibs.My 6 month old makes a real mess during mealtimes and these bibs have proven to be a great product.Even though it's recommended NOT to put them in the dryer, I've done it and had NO PROBLEMS!!A couple of people may complain that these are thin but it's really not a factor since they're definitely waterproof!I bought these bibs for the variety of bright, plain colors (No more trying to match lime-green-and-baby-blue bibs with pseudo-pithy sayings to outfits!!!Hooray!!)A few reviews had me worried about the latter, but do not fear - the bibs are three layers: two terry layers with a third waterproof (or at least very water resistant) inner layer.They've stood up to my 4-month-old's waterfall of drools quite well.Though these bibs are exactly as described, I have not given them five stars since they have a very scratchy hook-and-loop (generic Velcro) closure that irritates my baby's neck.I would much prefer snaps, or at least a side closure.If only more mothers developed products... :)First we play with the ones with holes and sprinkle the water like a little waterfall.Then as she got older, she's 8 months now, she likes to hold them and bang them together.Very convenient, practical use.My 8-month old LOVES this toy!Some of them have holes so the water/sand trickle through.I didn't think too much of it until I saw how my child uses this toy - in the bathtub he is exploring the idea of volume and relative size.As a bath toy it can't be beat - doesn't retain water and stink like rubber duckies.They come in handy when rinsing him off too.I have added other toys to his bath repertoire, but he prefers the stacking buckets.He now knows how to stack them and continues to do so repeatedly.Never been using it as a stacking toy as he has so many other but I can see him making a stack with these.Cheap and good.One of the best toys that's educational/mind bending (at least for a 7 mos old), inexpensive and pvc free.My poor little guy has acid reflux that would really upset him as he tried to eat or sleep.He'd arch his back and belt out a yell causing mom and me no end of upset.The pediatrician prescribed Zantac but getting that liquid in his mouth was one hurdle.Until I learned about the Kidz Med Pacificer from KK Cool Tools.No leaks, no spills.Easy to clean.So much easier than a syringe or medicine dropper!!This stool is the perfect height for my three year old to use at the sink when brushing his teeth or washing his hands.Fortunately, we did not pay a lot for the actual Bjorn carrier as it was a hand me down.It's thinner than paper, and it constantly falls off - EVERY TIME you take the baby in/out.Really, I could have just lived with the fading.this product has got black bits of towel/terry falling off right out of its packaging.on the carrier and even on my baby too.I wonder if it only happens for black?Thin fabric.Pain in the neck to keep in place.Have to reposition or replace every time you take the carrier off.Better just to use a burp cloth.I guess alot of kids do and that's why baby bjorn made this bib and decided to charge $8 a piece for a terry cloth.Their marketing team must be pretty smart since they figured out there will be parents willing to spend that money to decorate their baby carrier...So it's a thin piece of terry cloth, just as thin as the cheapest burp cloths you can buy in bulk.We also bought the bibs since she sucks on the bjorn and we did try putting a burp rag between her and the bjorn, only to have it fall out.Well, I lost one of the bjorn bibs in a parking lot, it fell off when i removed the bjorn.Go figure.Any baby will spit up, or just drool, while you are out walking, so this will help save your carrier somewhat.Honestly though, any burp rag/towel would fit this purpose in a pinch.yourself and save the money.Convenient, but might not be worth the price.That being said, we use it, so I'm glad we have it.Great padding that was essential when baby arches her back thereby slamming her head on it.It has a textured bottom to prevent slipping.I know they probably have to put that strap on it for liability reasons, but I removed it permanently (I think it hindered the traction on the bottom and I'm not walking a way from my kid on the changing table anyway, and it would only get in the way of changing diapers/clothes!Nothing special, basic and durable.It is cheap and has lasted us so far 6 months without problems.I forsee no issues with it either.I was debating whether to spend more at a baby super store but there is really no need.I would recommend this one and buy it again if i had to do it over again.UPDATE Oct '10:  So far almost 14 months of use and no issues.My daughter jerks back a lot though, so I still always have one hand on her at all times.It's great for going for a walk, but not when you need both hands for something else like pushing a stroller or carrying groceries.I think this is a must have for an older baby for quick uses--where you just need 1 hand.I looked at the BundleMe, but then read that it's not recommended by car safety experts because it sits between baby and the car seat bottom, somehow compromising the seat's performance in a crash.I thought the head opening might bother my baby, having the fabric so close to her face, but it doesn't seem to.I recommend this to other mothers.This is a fabulous product!You can dress your child in LIGHT LAYERS, especially good while riding in the car.It traps child's heat remarkably well, so again don't overdress your baby when using this product.It works like a sleeping bag.And I love that it doesn't cover my daughter's head!!The other products on the market look like they could be a suffocation hazard!REALLY, I saw a mom at the store with the 'other brand' and when she pulled back the cover to reveal her little bundle I was shocked and mortified someone would actually close their newborn up in it.So, needless to say I think this is not only a wonderfully designed and functionally sound product, but it is fool-proof for some parents.The only downfall I have is I can't fold the top neck away from my child when not using it in the car.To me it kind of gets in the way.(Go Grandpa!)It's very efficient and has lights that are activated by the baby's cries - in case you're in a noisy environment - like the garage - and cannot hear well.I keep one of the receivers on my headboard and while I keep it on the lowest volume setting I do hear a bit of a buzz.So I turned it off during the night.I'd definitely buy this again.Quick back story.. baby was born a preemie and needed to be monitored really well for the first few weeks at home.It worked amazingly.I actually wish that I used this earlier.I could distinguish the difference between normal breathing and any funky noises.This monitor truly gave me peace of mind.This monitor always had a lot of static in the background.Sometimes it would not even work because of the amount of static.A piece of junk!Save your money and buy something useful.We have used two other monitors before (in the same location that we had these) and never had any problems with humming.You could even hear it when watching TV, so it wasn't a quiet hum or one that could be easily drowned out.We returned ours.My baby is now 10 months old and the monitor is kept on under her crib 24/7.Sometimes I wish it wasn't so crystal clear.:) We've had no issues.I really appreciate the lights that activate with her sounds.Excellent product and we've had no issues with our cordless phones, or other electronics (cell phones, wireless networks, etc).They have a lot of static, but you don't need the volume cranked up to hear the baby - I could hear him pretty clearly whether he was crying or quietly babbling to himself.I did pick up another monitor on one of the channels.Keep this in mind if you have neighbors with babies.Since the monitor has two channels, I just switched to the other one (and turned the monitor off after naptime so the neighbors couldn't hear my singing/TV/what have you).They still work after a year, and I haven't really even taken very good care of them - they've been loose in suitcases, they've been yanked off of shelves and fallen on hard floors.This is the first time I've reviewed a product on Amazon, which should emphasize how strongly I feel about this product.I will start by saying that it serves it's basic function.If my baby is crying, I can tell.But I would not trust it if I were sleeping in one room and she were down the hall in her bedroom (she is still in a bassinet).Unfortunately, I have found this monitor to be VERY noisy with a lot of static/feedback.Not only is this really annoying, but I can't hear small sounds my baby  makes.As a first-time mom, I want to hear EVERYTHING.It does have the light function to indicate sound, but there are always 2-3 of those lights lit at all times due to the static in the monitor itself, so again I can't tell when my baby is making noise.As a result of all this, I do not trust the monitor and am constantly running to check on my baby myself which defeats the purpose of a monitor.I currently have the Summer Infant Day & Night handheld video monitor (best selling video monitor on Amazon) on my wish list.Can't wait to get rid of this one!I couldn't find a store that carried both, so I picked up one of each.Here are my comparisons on certain features.Folded Size: Winner - tieThe Deluxe Fold & Go, when folded, is the same width, but about 2" shorter in length than the Munchkin Kit.However, because of this, it is also bulkier when folded.However, the Fold & Go Kit's pad is lightly padded throughout, while the Munchkin Kit only has padding for the baby's head; no padding anywhere else.The allows for more room to hold a small tube of cream or Vaseline.This makes the Fold & Go Kit's pockets less structural, which is really not an issue with something stiff like a wipes case, but is a pain with soft squishy things like diapers.Contents are very secure in the Munchkin Kit.This isn't a problem while the kit is closed, but when opening the kit, the wipes case very easily (and does) fall out of its mesh pocket.The Fold & Go Kit's openings are not elastic - which is ok since they aren't stiff at all, but is a really nice touch on the Munchkin Kit.Velcro closure: Winner - Deluxe Fold & Go KitThe Deluxe Fold & Go Kit wins this round because it has more Velcro.This allows you to stuff more into it, and keeps the overall kit closed better.But as a result, it isn't as attractive as the Munchkin Kit.One downer about it, though is that the interior is not moisture resistant; you can see the lining.I wouldn't put leaky pens in this pocket.Stroller strap/carrying strap: Winner - Munchkin Travel KitThe Munchkin Kit's stroller strap is longer and has more Velcro so the length can be varied.The Deluxe Fold & Go Kit's stroller strap has only a small patch of Velcro, so its length is fixed.The kit also has decorative accents sewn in.The Fold & Go Kit feels like alot of vinyl, very plasticky.Ok for inside a diaper bag, which is our intended use, but not very pretty to carry in public by itself.And if you're using this inside a diaper bag like I am, a lot of the features that make the Munchkin Kit more desirable aren't even necessary.Overall, we are keeping both of these bags, though we have no intention of using them as a diaper kit on their own.They will be used as changing pads with a little extra.They have no room for other things like pacifiers, change of clothes, or a cell phone.These aren't hands free, either, so I recommend only using these if you have a stroller to put these in, or they will be a pain to carry around.If you need something this small, you might want to look into a smaller diaper bag instead.UPDATE 8/22/11:This diaper kit has held up very well over the past year.We somehow misplaced the wipes case (I'm sure it will reappear) so now when it is rolled up, it looks more like a big burrito.Not too bad, but then becomes bulky in the diaper bag.The Munchkin diaper kit stays slim even when the wipes case is missing.Just another factor to consider....I bought this product after much consideration.I kinda thought it would just be another toy they would never use.The product did arrive with no instructions, but I read the reviews on amazon and found several people who wrote very detailed instructions -- I had no problem reading the customer reviews and filling it up.I have twin boys --age 5 months-- and put them on the mat immediately!So I decided to put my other little guy on the mat and see what he would do -- within 5 minutes he also rolled over for the first time!I've only used this one time as it only arrived yesterday, but I plan on using more often during time!My 5 yo DD received this toy for her first birthday.She loved putting the toys in and out of the cake, and eventually zipping it shut.All the pieces of this set are still in great shape, even though I've had to wash a few due to drool.My daughter still plays with the set, though now her stuffed animals are having the birthday and she is masterminding the party.The only downside is that the little toys are like chihuahua-bait.I have had to retrieve them from the dog bed many times!...debatable about a toy too.My 6 mo old doesn't seem into it and the mirror is absolutely pointless... (sigh)  I so wanted a fun toxin free toy for the car  - maybe he'll like it when he's older and I'll update then.I gave it 3 stars because of quality and PVC free.It is still very handy for water bottles, water bottle spouts, etc.), it is very durable.Pros:  Only brush we have used that doesn't spray when in use (like crazy), tiny nipple brush has many uses for water bottle spouts, etc, suction cup keeps it standing up automatically, attractiveCons:  noneI have read a lot of the negative reviews and just don't agree with them.But the negative part is that it is very stiff and so stiff that I have to push it inside the smaller bottles.And when  I take it out, it sprays water all over me!I won't buy it again.Buy Dr Brown's instead.I actually purchased this from a local retailer after I had worn out a different brand of bottle brush.The bristles are stiff and difficult to fit into the neck of my standard size Dr. Browns bottles.When I pull the brush out of the bottle, soap suds spray everywhere (sometimes forcing me to re-rinse items that I have washed and layed out to dry).This new mom does not appreciate the extra work.I gave it 2 stars.Or maybe for a Magarita party?It works very well at scrubbing kids plates though.It is used exclusively for cleaning baby bottles/nipples and milk pump accessories (horns/valves, etc).It is a decent brush, but does not seem to hold up, and we'll need to replace it soon.Having the suction cup bottom is handy, as it allows us to leave it standing next to the sink without worried about it getting contaminated.It seems to work well on the bottles we use (Nuk & Medela 5 oz and straight wall 80cc).The bristles tend to fill the bottles well, and clean them thoroughly.Annoying, but probably going to happen with any bristle-type brush.The smaller brush is handy for getting the inside of the Nuk/Medela nipples, which are too small to fit my fingers into for cleaning.The major downside is that the bristles are already compacting on the larger brush, so it is getting more difficult to use in cleaning the pump horns, and doesn't get the corners of the normal bottles as well as it used to.We'll have to replace it soon, and don't expect the next to last much longer than this one.NOTE: We still have a Munchkin brush similar to this style from about 4 years ago that is still in decent shape (just not something we'd consider clean enough to use for baby), and the bristles are still solid on it, so they may have changed materials at some point between the two purchases.That one has been used for a while to clean all sorts of things, and seems to have a bit of life left in it.It really gets the whole bottle clean, easily.The suction cup on the bottom is nice to let  it drain and sits great on the sink.I would buy this again.I love the fact that it has a suction.And really, people?Giving it a bad review because you got pink and your baby is a boy???Come on, that has nothing to do with the product and I don't think your baby will be "wearing" it!Anyway, yes I recommend it.It has it's flaws but for me, it's the best I've found.This bottle brush has extremely rough bristles!It scratches up the insides of every plastic bottle I tried it on (including Born Free, Dr.Brown's and Avent).The bristles are so stiff that when you pull the brush out of the bottle neck, it sprays water in a mist everywhere, even with the wide neck bottles.Because the bristles don't hold soap like typical sponge material, I have to reapply soap often.If you use glass bottles, it won't scratch obviously, so this is an okay choice if you don't mind the spray.There really needs to be more bristles though.The large side does a great job at cleaning a bottle part, while the smaller brush cleans nipples and the grooves where it screws on and off.Now that my kids are both too big to use bottles, I still keep it out and use it for cleaning glasses and other products in the kitchen.It doesn't shout "BABY!!!!"I don't even have to worry if it's a duplicate gift because having two wouldn't be a problem!My first bottle brush was "The First Years Bottle Nipple Brush" but that broke after a few months and it was time to get a new brush anyway so I decided to get this one since it got better overall reviews.Well... it must be hard to make a good bottle brush... it's not terrible but because the brush is round with stiff bristles, it doesn't clean the bottom of the bottle well so now the insides of my bottles have a ring along the bottom edge that can't get cleaned.The only issue I have is that the top bristles are starting to flatten and that's probably because I am jamming it in the cup to scrub some things that are stuck to the bottom.I bought a few of these after reading stories about moms using them to layer between sheets on the crib for quick changes at night.Initially I put one underneath my own bedsheet while pregnant in case my water broke in bed.Since we have not really had any night time leaks or "blowouts" yet, I am less concerned at this point.Overall, it's a good product and the best price is the two-pack on Amazon.Rain cover perhaps?Or the car seat adaptor?I can't believe how much these high end strollers cost and then they nickle and dime you for accessories.And I am not in the slightest convinced that the BOB stroller is so high quality you are paying for the quality and adding in any extras would just inflate the price.They should easily be able to include accessories and still make a TON of profit.Grrrrr.Anyway - this little item is mediocre at best.Yes, it's an old camera, and kind of chunky, but...  Dualie stroller console should have TWO pouches, or one bigger one.They work for that.I got this cheap on craigslist - I am glad I didn't pay full price.For the price you could probably get two nice hard cup holders (liquid holster type) and ghetto rig up some sort of little pouch to stash other stuff.I am picturing some sort of plastic hoop with a fabric bag attached, so it holds a lot and is easy to reach in and out of.Just received our Walking Wings and it is a really good idea.This is a a must have to save your low back from bending over and you babies arms from being pulled on.it pulls baby's underarms kind of weird and it seems extremely uncomfortable for the baby; I never used it and I don't think I would ever do so I do not recommend this product to anybody.My baby is 9 months old.He can't walk, but thinks he can and refuses to do anything else.This product is amazing.The product holds him really well, even when he stumbles and falls, I can lift him up using the handles of the wings.I honestly don't understand why would some reviewers say that it's a waste of money.We even used it to go to the mall, kids parties, etc., and it was a really nice buy.You have to be carefull when use it, but overall it was a good investment.Some good features are its durability, big size to fit even the britax marathon...does its purpose in protecting the car seat I think.I had a hard time putting the carseat into the bag because wasn't sure exactly which way fits the best.There's no like arrow or something pointing to which way the carseat should face in there.Also lugging it around the airport was quite tiring.Maybe we should have gotten the one with 2 straps like a backpack instead of just 1 that it has.I received the product 2 days earlier than expected which was great!Our other car seat bag is the Eddie Bauer one.Getting a full sized carseat into the Sunshine Kids bag is as much of a wrestling match as it is with the Eddie Bauer bag; however, the Eddie Bauer bag is made of far better materials.We thought we'd take a chance with this since the Eddie Bauer bag is now tough to find and more $$$ + this Sunshine Kids bag got decent reviews.The EB one has held up to many trips where the people in baggage have dragged it across the pavement...The Sunshine Kids bag however did not.The bag was very worn, but not ripped after our first flight.When we attempted to put in the carseat for our return flight, the bag riped in the biggest wear spot.In fact, just the stress of trying to get the seat in the bag caused a rip nearly the full length of the bag.The airline had to put it all into a plastic bag b/c it was such a useless mess.So, all these people who left glowing reviews are just lucky...that's all.This product is a total piece of junk!!!!!!!I feel weird saying that it's only three-stars for education, because at four-months, isn't everything educational to a baby?Anyway, this toy is very cute, but it is small, so check the dimensions before you order if you're expecting something bigger.It's a little expensive, but worth it to me.My daughter enjoys chewing on wood, and I enjoy knowing that she's chewing on something made to EU standards, so it isn't nearly as likely to be toxic as her plastic toys from China.Once you start pumping milk and storing it, you quickly realize bottles and bags take over your freezer.This little rack is very handy for keeping the 'next to use' bottles ready for dispensing, which is great.However, you're limited to bottles for it's organizational benefits.I ordered extra bottle to be on the safe side, but I ran out and started using bags,  which are now in the middle of the 'first in first out' rotation, so I have bottles simply standing about in the freezer.The bottles fit perfectly with my Medela Pump-in-Style pump parts.Cons:~If the back of the rack isn't against a flat surface, it's not too difficult for a bottle to roll off in the back when you're trying to shift things around.~If you mistakenly remove the front bottle and then decide you don't want to defrost, forget about easily putting it back.I had a fiasco which resulted in a cracked bottle of frozen milk.Overall, decent product for storage purposes, but probably better used for organizing refrigerated-only milk.I work full-time and pump for about 1 year with my kids (on number 3 now).This helps a busy household because everyone can tell which milk to use next for baby.I stopped labeling dates and times on the milk because of this system.I like that it is BPA free.The little round thing you put in the bottle before you put the lid on is difficult to fit in at times, but I think it prevents spills when the milk lays sideways in the rack.However, 4 oz in these bottles is not the same as 4 oz.in my Dr. Brown bottles or even in my Ameda pumping bottles.I don't know if the marks on the bottles are just estimated numbers or what, but it gets frustrating when I think I have enough milk in the mother's milkmate bottle to make full eating bottle for my baby and then have to go and use some of the freshly pumped milk.FYI - they do fit perfectly on my Ameda Purely Yours pump.We've been using all of these a lot and I'm glad that I have these extras.It's useful when I haven't had time to sterilize the used ones.I ended up buying a second gate for another spot in my house.Buy this -- you won't be disappointed.It's quite strong as it's shipping weight of 20 pounds would imply (that 5 pounds more than the shipping weight of the regular Dreambaby security gate).This is super-easy to install on "some" areas because it's pressure mounting style is intuitive and doesn't require many parts.I am currently using  one and three of the regular Dreambaby gates (and two other different types as well).2 Words of Caution:1) This is probably not the best gate to install at top of stairs simply because you'd have to use screws and there aren't enough screw holes (just one for top and one for bottom on each side, and you'd really need twice that).2) The pressure mount is not designed for most situations where there is molding.But decorative molding may make this gate too difficult to install without getting creative with well-cut pieces of wood or some other creative method.The included extentions:Dreambaby sells this product on Amazon with the extensions included, one for each side (you're not supposed to use two on one side although some people have done so with success).Whereas you're paying for the extension (nothing is free), it is a convenience especially when you see what all the gate marketers charge for an extension separately.I used one extension on two of them and two on one of them.I cannot imagine what a pain it would have been to order the extensions separately.It's better than my other gates.The door closes shut automatically when you open it even halfway and let go.Very convenient.That's because a baby can push on it and go down the stairs with it if it fails, God forbid.But installing it was more difficult and time-consuming that it would be to install many pressure mounted gates.It has two screws for each of the 4 contact points.Guess what?- You really have to throw away those screws because they're too short and insufficient.So you have to get your own appropriate screws.Moreover, this one doesn't close and "lock" automatically like the Dreambaby gate.Please see my review on it for tips regarding installing it (or other reviews that have good tips).Conclusion:The pressure mounted Dreambaby gate is near perfect for non-top of stairs uses providing that there is not decorative molding to interfere with installation.Inclusion of the extensions was a good idea even if it drove up the cost a little.The gate is easy to open one handed, and I love that it opens in either direction.Our plus-sized friends can fit through the gate with no problem.This product seems excellent so far; we have only had them for about a month, now.We decided to get the extra tall based on user reviews of the regular height that said the children began to climb the gates as they got older.We have large dogs, thus the tall one.We put it up with the sticky tape but decided to skip the screws and it has not been knocked down once, by dogs or children.I've had this gate for 8 months and the locking mechanism is still going strong.2 months ago we received three children and they go in and out of the room 1,000 times a day.This is one of the best investments that we have made!We have two that keep half the house "off limits."It's also tall enough to discourage our two golden retrievers from jumping up on it or trying to get through.Our son (now 16 months) hangs onto them and shakes them with all his body, like a prisoner trying to escape and it's hopeless- he will not get through no matter how much he may try.The only reason to not give this gate 5 stars is that the installation process, however easy it may be, is very sensitive.You have to make sure that the bottom of the gate is exactly level, otherwise the swing-closed mechanism may not work smoothly.We had to re-install one cup that holds the pressure mount in order for the gate to swing closed on its own like it's designed.Also- the installation requires you to drill screws into the door frame (or wall or wherever you install it) and this will leave holes once we eventually take the gates out.If you're looking to use this gate with the extensions, good luck!I have a 65" opening that needs a gate and I went to the manufacturers website plus amazon to make sure I had the correct measurements and extensions I needed.The gate metal was warped and the door would not latch at all, unless we had the hulk handy to completely bend the gate!We returned this gate and have since gotten the Summer Infant Sure and Secure extension gate.Dad-to-be loves the style and function of this bag even though baby isn't due for 10 more weeks.He likes the cell phone pocket on the strap, the many pockets, etc.Good idea but never used it.I tried once but it didn't really hold a lot.It's okay but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.That's the ONLY complaint I have about this product; it's a very narrow pocket and a phone the size of an iPhone will not fit there.It would be a very convenient place for the phone too.So I keep lip balm in there instead.My husband and I take this everywhere we go and if I'm carrying it, it acts as my purse also.I bought this as mine and my husbands diaper bag.I wanted to get something that he would be ok with carrying around... but as it turned out he rarely carried it since we mostly went places while he was working.Since I realized that it was mine, instead of ours, I ended up going with a more stylish Coach diaper bag that could later serve as a giant purse.If we ever have another baby the Diaper Dude will be a spare bag that will stay in my husbands car.This is by far my favorite diaper bag - even over my $$$$ ju ju be bag.First off the bag itself is light so when you pack it full it's not like you are lugging around a heavy bag (as was the case with my ju ju be bag).And I LOVE that they zip so when I drop the bag or it tips over I don't have to worry about my stuff getting dirty or falling out - the main compartment is also zippered.Granted the changing pad isn't ultra cushy but it serves it's purpose.Inside the bag you can fit lots.One of my favorite features are the built in stroller clips.Thank you diaper dude for including that, so nice and convenient!The only negative is the cell phone pouch - it is tiny.I can't fit my phone in it.But it is removable to I just took it off.Overall I LOVE this diaper bag.And my husband doesn't mind carrying it also as it doesn't scream diaper bag.I would definitely recommend this to friends!I wanted to purchase a diaper bag that didn't look like one.But I do wish I had searched around more.The Diaper Dude is bulky.It's hard to find what you are looking for in the larger storage area and it's always in the way.A backpack-style bag would have been a better option.Sterilizes your bottles in minutes and keeps it sterilized up to 24 hours.When she started to walk, she kicked the ball around.It's a good concept.I wish they made one for like little babies, I don't know something like 6-9 months or 6-12 months.This is a little too big and has a horrible way to tighten it up in the back.I think it needs a velcro or something.But I love how easy is to clean it and that 80% of the clothes remain clean.Sorry for shouting.So in love with it that I immediately had to get online and review it.My daughter is the messiest, drags her arms through the food, smears it into the tray, rubs it in her hair, on the walls.She has a fit when she I put a bib on her.She just doesn't like bibs for some reason.I usually give in and then I have to work on her clothes to get stains out.It had gotten so bad that I have been feeding her in nothing but her diaper and wiping her down from head to toe after.I got this bib today and I gave it the ultimate test, lasagna.Nothing on her clothes thanks to this bib.It washed up easily.I am very happy with this product and will probably order another.Also look at the Sugar Booger Splat Mat on Amazon.My little guy loves to feed himself...and I was doing laundry after every meal.Regular bibs just don't cut it.it's truly a cover ALL and big enough that it will fit for a long time.now that my 18 mo old is becoming more independent and wanting to feed herself, the highchair and her clothes would be a total mess after a meal.it has saved me so much time and laundry!plus the fact that its a tie back vs velcro means that it stays on for good!She decided to let them self-feed from the beginning, so meals are pretty messy.My daughter likes that they are thin and fold up well to carry in the diaper bag.It also means they dry quickly when washed.With the weather so much warmer, long sleeves were sometimes too hot.We were disappointed to find these bibs have Velcro closures instead of the tie closures mentioned in the product description.I hope they haven't made this a permanent change.While this is a great pillow, it is shaped like an animal for their enjoyment it is comfy, but my son just didn't like it, that's on him though and not the product.We have used this pillow a few times for our 18 month old.So far we are glad that we have purchased it.It fits her well and seems to hold her head in place well when sleeping in the car.Potty training has been a breeze so far!The side compartments are great for storing extra underwear and clothes!Which I do often since I take the potty to the sitters house!Thank you Boon for making potty training a little smoother!The price was right on for this product but that's about where my satisfaction ends.The carseat also slides around on the hard plastic top of the saver.Wish this product was larger overall and had the no-slip grip on both sides.I have not tried it with my carseat forward facing so I cannot review for that function.This is a must expecially if you allow your kids to snack in their car seats.I purchased this toy while I was pregnant with my son.I started using it while he was only a few weeks old.Once he started rolling over and sitting on his own this toy became one of his favorites.Once he started sitting it was the stripped handle that kept his attention as he would flip it back and forth, and occasionally he would accidently turn the music on, soon he learned to turn it on on purpose.It wasn't until around 9 months that I put it in his room at night for the light show.He loved it immedietly, and although he preferrred to roll on his tummy to sleep he started falling asleep on his back watching his light show.Soon I found a way to attach it to his crib with some cable ties, and since then he happily turns this toy on whenever he needs it!Sometimes I hear it him turn it on in the middle of the night on the baby monitor.Before bed, before naps, and fist thing in the morning!It is still attached to his crib and he happily turns the music on and switches between the sounds, I have it set to play for 5 minutes, and I haven't replaced the batteries yet!I have the fish aquarium also attached to his crib and it runs out of battery power weekly with less use, and now even after I put new batteries in the fish he just assumes it doesn't work and doesn't even bother trying anymore.Pros:*By far the best crib toy we've had.*Soothes him to sleep (boring to us, not to him)he loves the music and and light show, but not over stimulating*Comforting, and easy to take along on trips or the sitters house (we used it on a 16 hour flight)*Excellent battery life!Used daily for the last 18 months, set to play for 5 minutes and have yet to replace the batteries!*My child still prefers the simpliest of shapes designed for the youngest child.Cons: *No crib attachment, (however we attached securely with cable ties, however cable ties will need to be cut and replaced to change batteries)*Wall images won't be very vibrante in a bright room (my son never seemed to care) we could always see them although sometimes faint*Images may seem somewhat blurry on a high ceiling, or if not on a flat surfuce.But he learned quickly.I like that it has both letters and shapes.As for the letters being hard to sort, we had no trouble at all.My daughter got this when she was 6 months old, so she was a little young to truly appreciate it for what you're supposed to actually do with it.Now that she's older, she really enjoys the clock, chickens and spinning thing on the sides.She's not so crazy about the letters-they are difficult to get into the holes unless you line them up just right AND push them in-she doesn't really have the patience for that.She does still enjoy the animals, although most of the time she pulls them off, opens the barn door and plays farm.As a sorting toy, it's lacking, but if you have a child who is creative, like most kids, they will surprise you and end up using it for something other than what it was intended-in this case, playing farm, not learning shapes.So that gives me a break from all the songs, voices, and funny instructions that many of her other toys have.the baskets are good in size, but the linning is poorly made.It came with the loops falling apart and the ribbons are much darker than shown.Easy and fast to put on shopping cart.Great product![...]I did the big shopping cart cover but my baby was happy to lean forward to bite on the bars or lean to the side.I also felt a little conspicuous putting the big kind on a shopping cart and dealing with the baby at the same time.I keep it in my big purse.I walk in the store and place the baby in the cart.I can then quickly remove from my purse and have my baby strapped in before the next person comes for a cart.I seem so much smoother as a mom now.It also helps keep my little girl sitting straight up and not leaning forward or the side.She does not mind it at all.At the end when dealing with the groceries and the baby I simply pull it off and slip it into my purse.People stop me while shopping to comment on it.Yes my baby can put her hands on the germy areas of the cart but at least now she can't put her mouth on anything.I bought this pillow to make the transition to sleeping only on my side easier when I became pregnant.I wake up with a sore shoulder, which stinks because I love the rest of the pillow!I'm going to see if it's returnable, and I'm going to try the one shaped like a "6", and use my own pillow for my head.I have been using this pillow since I was about 14 weeks pregnant to "practice" and get used to sleeping on my side.Now that I am 20 weeks pregnant, I have been using it every night and it has been so helpful and my back pain is gone, and I can sleep on my side all night, and easily switch from side to side.This is soooo much better and I don't know how anyone can get through pregnancy without this.I was a stomach sleeper before!This is the most awful, pregnant unfriendly pillow.DO NOT buy it.It is too thick and too firm.When I'm on my side, I can hardly get my arm around the pillow because of the thickness and then the firmness prevents you from squeezing it enough so your arm fits around it.I've tested it out for three days and have not slept very much at all....it's been more of a nap than sleep.I slept better with just a regular pillow.Every day I wake up in so much pain---pain in my neck, arms and hips.Then the thing is so big you cannot roll over it.Umm...I'm pregnant and I have to be able to roll out of bed, but it's quite difficult with this large pillow in the way.I would recommend that you look at these at the store where you can touch it and see the thickness before buying.And then make sure you buy another brand because even if this one seems nice and acceptable...it is not!keep that in mind.Overall, this is a great pillow and I highly recommend it.Gives support from head to toe (I'm 5'5" and sleep with knees slightly bent; my top foot stays elevated with this pillow) -- most others on the market are too short to do that.Provides back support, and prevents me from rolling on my back when I sleep (which was a big concern).It's a little firm - but you're sleeping on your side, so you want your neck supported.The c-shape also makes it easier to get in/out of bed than if it didn't have the opening in the middle (ie, I don't have to climb over it).It's not even as big as I'd expected - in fact, my hubby and dogs still fit comfortably with me in our king-sized bed, with room to spare.Two minor drawbacks were already mentioned in other reviews - both have to do with the cover.I'll probably just end up making myself a new slipcover with softer fabric, and adjusting the seams to allow a little more give/room.JJ Cole makes a better, smaller one.Love this diaper bag.I throw it in my hiking back and take my little one hiking with me, good for a half day trip.Throw it in the truck anytime she is around.Its black, discrete, and extremely functional.I like the idea of this small diaper bag that can be stuck in a purse or just carried.The wipes case holds plenty of wipes.Cons: I wish the outside zipper pocket held more, my wallet is a little large and barely fits.Rather than having a desginated diaper bag, we just throw this into whatever is appropriate for the outing, a tote bag, the stroller basket, my shoulder bag, along with toys, nursing cover and burp cloth and we are ready to go.Only drawback is that it might not hold a full days supply of diapers when she is bigger and the diapers are bigger!This review is for the Skip-Hop Pronto and is from daddy's perspective.This was my bag of choice when taking my baby daughter to day trips to the museum, beach, friends, Grandma's, etc.I really liked the bag and used it for over a year as my daughter was still just wee.It held a travel-size package of wipes, a few infant diapers (or a couple of bigger ones), and a couple of tubes of hand sanitizer, bottom balm, etc.I always kept a larger, fully stocked diaper bag in the mother-ship (car) where room and space weren't as much an issue.Most importantly, it had nice padding that kept my daughter comfy while I went about the diaper business.The padding wasn't very thick, but it seemed to be effective against hard surfaces.The case had plenty of areas for storage for its size.*  Quality - Mine held up very well with frequent use over time.I saw other reviews that indicated quality problems and that's too bad.I bought mine in Fall of 2007, so perhaps the company changed manufacturers or materials that led to some shoddiness.Cons*  Price - I chose this over other, similar on-the-go diaper bags because I thought it had better styling and I thought the set-up was a little more functional.That being said, it was pricier than most others - sometimes significantly.It could probably be cheaper.I never had a problem with it and never considered it a problem.Some have noted that you can fit fewer larger diapers vs. infant-sized diapers.Just like you get fewer #4 diapers vs. newborn diapers in a package of the same size.I don't see this as a negative, as by the time my daughter was wearing #4 size diapers she was also going less frequently and more predictably than when she was in the infant size.One of the things I liked about this changing bag was that it was small; if I wanted something that would carry the same number of large-size diapers, I would just have lugged around my backpack-style diaper bag.Also, getting rid of the hard plastic case saves space and adds flexibility to the bag, in my opinion.Others may feel differently, but I didn't think the plastic case added any value.In the end, I used this bag more than any other and really liked it, and can recommend it based on that experience.I would rate the product five stars based on style, functionality, and size, but feel compelled to knock off a star for price.Saving ten bucks here or there can buy a lot of wipes, you know?This cover fits Sam's club carts more or less,It does not fit Wegmans or Target carts-the seat is too  deep, the handle is too far to be covered.However, I like it.It has nice pillows on the sides, so the baby can't reach the sides of the cart.I like that it is cushioned, folds down easily and comes with a very handy carrying bag.It is just a bit smaller than I thought it would be.And it doesn't fit elongated toilets the best which is what most public restrooms consists of.It has to sit at the back of an elongated toilet, so as a result, my daughter's legs (she is 3) are kind of lying on top of the icky toilet seat itself.But it certainly beats having to hold her over the toilet or her refusing to use it.It has not collapsed on us as a few others noted happened to them, but I can see how if you jump onto it, it might not be stable any more.Pretty gross in the men's restroom.Folds up really well, but it is rather large.This seat worked a total of two times before collapsing & dumping my son in the toilet.Worst travel toilet seat, ever.I followed the directions, making sure it sat well back on the toilet when in use, but it still sagged every time he used it, and then it just folded inward while he was sitting on it one day.Now he's scared to go on the "big potty" and begs me not to drop him in the potty whenever he goes.Don't waste your money on this product.This comes in its own carry case, is light and fits in a diaper bag.I used it for my daughter and then gave it to my sister to use which her boys.You're out shopping and your kid has to go, you don't have the potty chair with you so what do you do?You whip out this bad boy and show the other moms what you're made of.I have had my 16 month old daughter in a Marathon since she was 10 months.I am very passionate about rear-facing to the max weight.I ordered the roundabout for a trip because I thought it would be a little easier to lug around the airport than my daughters Marathon.Also we are pregnant and I figured we could use this for baby #2.Here's the problem...my daughter is 16 months now and weighs only 22 pounds.This carseat sits rear-facing up to 35 pounds.They can only sit rear-facing when there is 1 inch or more from the top of the seat to the top of their head.Sure, she can use it now, but obviously she would never make it to 35 pounds rear-facing.So basically this is a great seat, however, if you are concerned about having your child rear-facing as long as possible (which you should..type in rear-facing vs. forward facing on youtube and see the crash test results...if that doesnt convince you I dont know what will) this is not the seat for you.Go with the Marathon.My daughter has at least 4-5 inches left in her Marathon for rear-facing.Plus the marathon goes to 65 pounds forward-facing where the roundabout goes to 40.The roundabout is great for smaller cars so you have to do what you have to do.Just thought maybe this would help someone.I will lug her marathon on the trip and be ordering another marathon for baby #2.Good luck with your carseat choice.Whatever you get just make sure its installed properly.Take the time to take it to a certified station where they can check your carseat installation.Also the chest clip goes at the armpits..not lower.I swear..I have yet to see any of my friends put their kids in the seat right.When shopping for a convertible car seat for my son, I decided that it was much more important to me to buy a seat that had very good review and high safety ratings.I love the handy velcro on the seat belt which holds it out of the way when you put your child in.My mom bought a more inexpensive car seat for when she is watching my son, and while hers seems to work alright, I am always frustrated with the seat belt, which is VERY hard to tighten and loosen.The cheaper models I have seen are also a LOT more flimsy than the Britax.When shopping for a car seat, safety is most important!They're both essentially the same product- one is just wider.I also didn't like that the safety first sat ON the mattress instead of under.I wouldn't recommend this product for a twin size bed - would seem like there's too much of a gap on either sides (lengthwise) for a child to fall off.I would recommend this for a toddler bed - there is just the right amount of coverage to keep a child inside (lengthwise).Suggestions - I wish that this was taller (in height).Not that we're trying to keep him in - he thinks it's a toy/climbing wall.So he'll try to climb form the outside into his bed, or vice versa.It's sturdy that I'm not worried about him knocking it over or rolling out (our mattress is a standard size - I would suggest putting in the safety bar - which sits at the same heigh as the mattress.And it's about the same height (from the mattress as Safety First).Great shopping cart cover!Its cushy, supports my baby well, the print is cute, I love the pockets and it is very well made.I can't say enough good things about this product!!!I've had it for 10 months and don't go anywhere without it.Although it's more expensive than other brands, it's WELL worth the money.I take my baby shopping at least 2-3 times a week and people always ask me where I got it.It's the "Cadillac" of shopping cart covers.Here are the highlights:1) High quality material - The fabric is nice and heavy and very durable.I have machine washed this item many times and it still looks new.The bag comes with a pillow which is great to prop up a baby who's not quite sitting up on his/her own.2) Doubles as a diaper bag - I don't take a diaper bag or purse when I'm out shopping with baby.I just throw the Buggybagg over my shoulder and we're off!And there's an additional smaller pocket that I use for my wallet, keys, cell phone, and shopping list.3) Easy to fold and carry - This bag folds up and zips in a cinch.And has shoulder straps for carrying.It fastens on to a shopping cart with ease.In fact, I can hold baby in one arm and fasten the BuggyBagg with the other hand, no problem.4) Fun for baby!My baby is fascinated by that alone.There's also little loops on the insides for sippy cups.Only one tiny negative - I think the BuggyBagg is a little thick to use as a high chair cover.My son has huge thighs and has a hard time getting into a high chair with this cover.However, we have an Inglesina travel chair that we use at restaurants so it's no big deal that we can't use the BuggyBagg.If you're contemplating buying a cheaper product, don't do it!You will not regret buying the BuggyBagg.This walker was easy to set up (required no tools) which is very important to me.The stilts holding the seat up are trustworthy in my opinion, and they support very well while still being able to collapse for storage.The music is a little too loud for my liking, but there's an "on" and "off" switch that makes it a non-issue.If your baby isn't happy with how busy the front activity toys are, you can detach it and it becomes a tray (big plus for me).My baby really enjoys this, though her feet don't touch the ground.She's a small girl, though, so I imagine it's only a problem for people who have had preemies.I would strongly suggest you wait until after your baby turns five months before introducing this because their legs might not be long enough.my baby was 7mo when we got it she was 28in we've had it almost 2mo now.We bought this dresser as well as the tall chest of drawers and the crib back in 2006.My husband assembled all 3 pieces, but didn't seem to have any assembly issues until he got to the crib.In fact, the piece is ideal for anyone who doesn't want a changing table sitting around after the child is too old/big for it.I knocked off 1 star b/c the door is now broken.We had a makeshift fix for it that worked for about 6 mos, but 2 mos ago I just gave up and converted it into shelving/book case.It looked really good once we got it put together.It did take awhile, however, for my husband to get it together.This dresser is not good quality.We have had numerous problems with this dresser.Two of the drawers are constantly coming off the tracks.I don't like the fact that the changing table does not have a front lip/edge; it's a hazard in terms of my daughter falling off.I would not buy this dresser again.It is not worth the money at allThe drawers open/close smoothly, but I would have preferred the drawer bottoms to be made of wood rather than heavy cardboard / particle board material.This shade is basically like a piece of spandex with piping in the front to give it the curved shape - it fit my Graco Metrolite stroller with no problem and can see how this would/should fit any stroller.If the sun is pointed right at us, I can easily just pull the shade so it goes lower and then just pull it back when the sun is not in our face so my baby can see more!I would recommend this to anyone who thinks they need to get their baby sunglasses for taking walks.I would highly reccomend this product to anyone that uses their stroller outdoors often.This means it can be left attached when folding up the stroller, and doesn't get in the way when carrying or storing a closed stroller.However it is very poorly designed.The cupholders are also very narrow so only small drinks (maybe a can of soda) would work - we have had no luck with grande-sized cold drinks or bottled drinks.I am glad I have this organizer since my Maclaren Volo is bare bones, but I often find I mainly use it to hang things off of (hang a sippy off the edge of the top, throw a sweatshirt over it), rather than items inside it.He smiles, laughs, and flails his arms and legs in excitement any time we get near it, and would probably stare at it laughing and cooing for hours if I let him hang out on the changing table that long.Its been a real godsend for distracting him from his hunger screeching at 6am while I'm trying to get his diaper changed first!This is our favorite toy.There are a lot of toys and very nice sound effects, even the songs are okay.My little guy just discovered to zebra's tail on the mat.It has been fun for me to watch him grow from watching, to reaching, to grasping.I really like how large of a floor space it covers because it means more clean play space.The cat likes it too, and hides under the mat when the baby isn't using it.You can also choose the mode so you can have it play for 20 minutes straight for younger babies or the playing one where the baby has to touch the toys and it will play music.My daughter gets to play and have great fun while mommy gets to get things doneThe crinkly "leaf" encouraged our daughter to kick it.For several months, this was probably the best purchase we made, after a swing.Eventually--around the time she could sit up--she started getting bored with it, but we passed it on to our 4-mo-younger niece who is now loving it just as much.It's great that there are so many different things to look at.Shortly after we began placing her on the mat she began babbling for the first time... Perhaps thats all in the timing of her development, however, she doesnt babble anywhere else but on the mat.The music isn't that annoying especially since it's broken up with soothing nature sounds.The mat can easily be taken off & washed.Only other thing I can think of as a negative is the butterflies do not rotate on their own, for them to move you must do it yourself; otherwise great product!Would definitely consider purchasing our own.We really liked this and it kept the baby busy from about 2 months until about 6 months when he just wanted to get out of there and do things more exciting.I like all of the different textures and sounds from the mat and toys- the leaf on the bottom makes crinkly sounds, there are beads in a roller, and the mat itself has silky ribbon bows and other textures.But mostly she just likes looking at them right now, so it isn't a problem.It was easy to put together, and we've used it for a few minutes a day for a few weeks and the batteries are still going strong.This mat is very nice and easy to assemble.The batteries are installed on the big orange giraffe, and it is hard to get to them, which is exactly what you want for the safety of your baby.The mat has many "attractions" for your baby, from monkeys hanging from the tail to toucans to zebras.It is very well made.It has quite a few toys and empty hooks to put your own.The music is very nice and not annoying.My guy has reflux so I usually put him on the boppy looking up.If he's been awake (and digesting) long enough we do tummy time here too.This playmat has kept our daughter's interest from when she was only 1 month old.The are also quite a few toys that come with it that keep her interested.My daughter loves this and stays very entertained.Now if we see something in the store that we like, we check Amazon to see if there's a better price, and there always is!She will spend up to 20 mintutes or so lying on her back or rolling from side to side looking at the various toys and lights.I espcially like all the toy loops and their placement and have added additonal toys and moved things around to suit her position.I am sure as she gets older she will get more involved with the playmat's options.I paid about $70 for mine, at the time, that was a good deal.It was still a little more than I wanted to spend.However, I am glad I bought it, my son loved it and from the time he was a couple of weeks old until last week (he is now 7 months old and getting ready to crawl)  he used that mat several times every day!I never had to replace the batteries.SO why the four stars?Well, the price is a little steep, even a drop to $55 would be more appropriate.Also, one of the poles would come out.Now, I do have a 2 year old, and he also liked  to  "play" with the mat, so it is possible that our mat got a little rougher play than most, but it was still something we had to keep an eye on.Our daughter definitely has her favorites.The elephant that rattles is also something she'll grab at and watch.I know another reviewer said the way the mirror is positioned your baby can't look at themselves.We found this to be true also, but we were able to move the mirror from the place it comes in when shipped to a different position and the problem was solved.Now our daughter can stare at herself without me having to angle the mirror towards her!There are also extra rungs so you can purchase and attach more toys of your choice.We've added a bug that vibrates when pulled and a butterfly that chimes.Also there are attachments on the mat itself so when our DD is on her stomach she can play not only with the ribbons and tiger tail but whatever toy you would like to attach to the sides.- MUSIC: The music is great.It plays "row, row, row your boat," "friar Jack(sorry I don't know how to spell it in french)," and some other tunes I don't know.The music will also turn off after 20minutes to save battery life, which after daily use for 2 months we haven't had to change yet.Cons:- The mat is really thin.I probably never would have noticed but we have all hardwoods in our house and there is not enough padding for me to be comfortable having our little girl on it.We put it on a rug to give her extra padding especially when she was just learning to lift up her head.When she got tired she would just bang her head down and the mat is not padded enough for this!- I thought the mobile with the butterflies would spin but it doesn't.Maybe it's supposed to, but it's too tight.It doesn't bother me but it was something that I probably would have wanted to know just so I knew more about what I was purchasing.All that being said, I really would buy this mat again.This is a good buy for the babiesMy daughter adored her gym until she was about 6 months old and she started sitting.My daughter LOVED the giraffe - she would stare at it and grin and jabber to it non stop.It was so neat watching her go from just lying there to reaching up and batting her toys around.The monkey falls down after awhile but you can knot his tale to keep him up there.My daughter like to pull him down though.Once you set it up, it's really easiest to just leave it up until you're ready to pack it up for the next baby or yard sale.It's not difficult to take down and put back up - just not convenient if you need to do it often, which we didn't.He loved this mat way better than the Boppy mat I had for him.The blinking lights totally fascinated him and the lights are soft, though, and not annoying.My baby would smile at the giraffe which was cute.I think I finally put this mat away when he was 8 or 9 months old.That's a long time for such a baby toy.I took it out a week ago to let a friend borrow it and for fun set it up again.My 16 mo old sat in my lap for about 15 minutes watching this thing.He only kicked the toys until he was ten weeks and then started using his hands.He now at fourteen weeks has both hands and both feet hitting something at the same time.It is entertaining to watch and good exercise for him.We did add a few toys since all of the loops weren't used, which was a nice option.We also felt that the music and lights were too much for him until he was ten weeks old.He can stay here for at least 45 min.( THIS IS a bless for me SINCE HE WOULD NOT STAY IN ANY OTHER PLACE THAN MY ARMS.. ohh and now in this mat...=))LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!My baby has loved this from the time she was about 6 six weeks and would lie underneath it and look at the toys and lights and listen to the music, to now when she is 6 months and likes to roll around under it, sit on the side and play with the giraffe and lie on her stomach and study the patterns.However, shop around.The price for this toy varies a lot!This gym is the best!Also comes with melodies and sounds of nature.What caused the rainbow to shoot out of the giraffe's head?Is it indicative of a super power?2.I can identify the monkey, the birds and the fish on the mat, but what are the other two animals?That seems ridiculous...this is the jungle, people.The other one might be a cheetah, but it has hooves.Why must I violate the giraffe, who already seems to be in some distress due to the rainbow situation, every time I need to replace the batteries?On the bright side, I think this mat will come in very handy during lessons on tolerance and the ethics of scientific experimentation on animals.Great quality product by Fisher-Price, who else!My only gripe with this gym is that the butterfly mobile is not automatic- it doesn't move unless you move it.I was really bummed about that.The hanging toys are actually pretty hard- so sliding baby onto mat takes some real concentration- my poor guy has been bumped in the head a few times.The lights and music are great and actually keep my 4-months old attention for about 10 minutes.Overall I think it's definitely worth the price.But again- if your child needs more stimulation than try to find a gym with an automated mobile.I am very unhappy with this stroller.So many irritations, sigh, where do I begin?First, I'm only 5'3" but my feet hit the wheels as I walk with it, so my 6'3" husband has to baby-step it when he strolls it.Second, the shoulder straps barely adjust far enough to fit my son (who's 22 months, 75th percentile).The poor kid is squeezed in there, but even with the straps super tight he still manages to slip his arms right out, (yikes!).Third, the basket on the back is too small and difficult to get things in and out of.And lastly, and this is the kicker, it maneuvers horribly.Horribly!!I can't emphasize this last point enough.It's really obnoxious trying to stroll this thing around.Yes, I hate it.We bought this sucker as a light weight, running-errands-in-the-car option.But if I could do it over again, I'd either get one of those $20 jobs at Babies R Us, or I'd throw down the extra $30-$60 and get the low end Maclaren, (everyone I know who owns one raves about it).Either way, I would steer clear of this poorly designed, over-priced thing.its great, has decent storage for an umbrella stroller and paired with a sunshine kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy, is great for drinks and snacks.the only complaint is that its kinda hard to use the latch to lock the stroller, you really have to press down hard on it.the  cover is a great idea, but honestly, in the year that we have had the stroller, we've never used it, as when we travel, we use it in the airport and check it in at the gate.i wish they came in more colors - like purple!This is our second stroller.It is hard to lock when folded up, because it does not clip closed easily.We also kick wheels while walking.Our baby seems to like it, but sometimes slumps over do to the way the support straps are positioned and the stoller's seat flat back.One additional nice feature is that the there is a piece of fabric that folds over the latch that snaps the straps together.Recommended.My 8 month old is able to hold them herself and drink without spill.The sippy cups were great for my breast fed baby to learn to drink from; the only con is that the cups don't have a lid but I just use the lids from the snack bowls when we are out.Both the large and small bowls are great for serving cereal, purees and snacks.I fill up the larger bowls with Cheerios and toss it into the diaper bag without worrying about spills or snacks drying out.It has a little bit of everything I use all the time.It was so much cheaper than buying individually!!I haven't used the utensils and probably won't - I prefer the Munchkin spoons instead because they're soft.my lil one screams at the site of it but it works!Pigeon sells excellent baby grooming products!One of my favorites is an awesome infant nail scissors, which I can't find in amazon (I did however find a similar product -Simba Baby Safety Nail Cutter- Manicure Accessory- Safety Scissors-Easy To Control than Fingernail Clipper).She says that she needs a holster for them since she uses them so much.I use this almost every other day to clean my baby's nose.I think I paid too much for a nail clipper that doesn't seem to be anything special.I have invested in 3 different baby nail clippers and finally this is the one!I could have saved money to buy this to start with!It's sharp enough to cut baby's thin and soft nails while I feel safe enough not to cut his finger.Seems pricey but definitely worth the money.I've been using this since my baby was a week old.My only complain is it's too expensive!I left the original ice pack in a hotel freezer.: (The replacement seemed just like the original!I have the original pump in style and this is not the same icepack that it originally came with.It still fits in the cooler, but not as well as the original one, but you can still close the bag and everything.Otherwise keeps milk cold and works as expected.Our daughter loves it so much I ordered this as a back up.She is able to hang on to it, spin it, and use it as a teether.My baby gets a little over-stimulated with this one, but it's really cute and fun-looking!Definitely worth the incredibly low price!My daughter has a lot of fun playing with this.I got it for her when she was 6mos old, she still plays with it now at 9mos.The one we got is a different color than the one pictured (not that it bothered us; but just wanted to note that colors may vary).My daughter likes shaking and biting this, but also has fun spinning and watching the beads.My 7 month old loves to shake and bang this rattle.The medicine syringe leaks, making it useless.Also, once the insert that holds all of these items in place for display is removed, you have a messy and transparent case.What worked about this kit: The case itself is pretty sturdy.The medicine spoon is functional, and has a nice flat bottom so you can stand it up.The thermometer works, but mine takes forever to get a reading.The pharmacy will provide you with a medicine spoon or syringe if you need liquid medication.Given the quality of the items provided in this kit, and the general availability of those items, there are better options.You're not likely to put together the usable components for much less than the sum of $15 so if you want it all and a carrying case, I'd recommend this.At the middle of the night, my 3m-old baby had a fever.. thermometer never worked, I had to use the family's one.After confirming fever and a quick call to the nurse, had to give him some medicine... but using the syringe was a NIGHTMARE and a big mess with medicine leaking all over the baby and all over my hands!!WE ended up using a spoon (not the one in the kit, which shows ml by halves like 1 1/2, 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and so on.. and didn't want to guess where the 2ml mark was) I had to buy health care items separately.It was a little more expensive than the kit, but now I'm sure everything in the health care box works!I agree with the other reviewer that my baby starting at 7 mos started to bunch up this bib when she's trying to lift her hands to her mouth.I do recommend this but I am going try the Bjorn bibs to see if the bunching up stops there.My daughter is small for her age, so we have to use a smaller, cloth bib under this one to catch the mess between the bib and her neck.it's cheap and comfy; my baby doesn't like any bib, but this one is the only he accepts; the other expensive ones became toys or trash .... never used them.I do recommend it 100%I got this one bib for my daughter, when she was 1 1/2 yo (about a year ago), and was feeding herself.I had a little doubt when I purchased it, because some times a lower price indicates a lower quality, but this is definitely not the case!I tried the cheap Target brand knockoffs with a similar waterproof pocket design and they were flimsy and didn't hold up well at all.The waterproof coating began peeling off almost immediately.I also tried the Baby Bjorn Soft Bib which was more of a rigid plastic.Easy to clean and durable.No problems so far and is a must.I recommend this product.I ordered these for our nursery to put on the changing table shelves.I plan to dye the liner & paint the basket to go with the decor of the room.When they arrived, they were in great condition (a worry of mine since they are wicker which tends to break easily).I just got this bed, put it together.The metal frame was a bit confusing, the metal hinges are not to be extended parallel to the frame but are angled upwards, then it all makes sense.I used a lever to make it all level.And that's WITH the help of a goo-removing solvent!Do not underestimate how irritating this can be.If I had more time, I'd write the manufacturer because that's two hours I'll never get back.We put the toddler rail in the closet for later, and the naturepedic mattress fit snugly inside.I like that the highest crib placement is very high and makes it very easy to put a sleeping child to bed in without waking her.I would definately recommend this crib.(needing a screw driver, which was not included.)The only flaw I have to mention is that it gets scratches easily.Be cautious when you are around the crip!However, my wife and I strongly recommend this item.I had the DaVinci Kalani Convertible Crib in Espresso all picked out for my baby back when I was still expecting, but couldn't order it cause our place was too small.My baby is now 9 months old and we were finally able to order it.The directions for assembly were a little confusing but my husband was still able to put it together in an hour.It was delivered with a couple small nicks but nothing too noticable.I was expecting it to scratch and dent really easily from some of the other reviews but so far so good!It doesn't come with screw-hole covers.I can see my baby using it for a good long time.Well worth the price, especially with free shipping from Amazon!The box was pretty darn heavy so mama's don't attempt to move it like I did.It took us about 2 hours to put it together.It seems to be pretty stable and well-constructed, although we aren't due until May and obviously haven't used it yet.The one complaint I do have are the stickers on the wood...I read tons of reviews on several different websites and of several different cribs.Ultimately we chose this crib and could not be happier.We ordered the crib in cherry hoping, like other reviewers had mentioned, that the color would be a little darker than what was pictured.This is what I had wanted so we were happy with it but that would be something to consider if ordering the cherry color and you are expecting the lighter color pictured.The crib has 4 height settings that will be easy to adjust as our baby gets older.Also the toddler rail came with the crib and that will save us in the long run if not with money but also with having to try and match the wood color.I haven't had a problem yet with the wood scratching.I read that in a lot of reviews so I have been very aware of that possibility but my ring and belt have caught the wood several times without leaving a mark.It wasn't enough to send it back and with the crib being sent overseas I thought it was amazing it made it with very minimal damage.crib bumpers, mirrors, aquariums etc.We had no problem putting the crib together.It took only an hour between my husband and I.We originally got a drop-side crib from a friend when they no longer needed it.That was fine for us as we weren't looking to spend a lot of money on a crib.Then, the recent crib recall made us a little nervous (our crib wasn't recalled though) and we had an incident where the drop side got stuck in the down position and then fell on my foot.We decided to replace our crib with a static side one.We decided on this one in the cherry finish to match our existing changing table.I had read about the wood being soft - that is definitely true.The box had a couple of dings in it, but everything inside was pretty well protected and nothing was missing.It's not so heavy that you can't move it if you need to.It was a more reasonably priced crib that I found.It wasn't too bad to put together either, might have taken an hour.A light finish may be less obvious to any blemishes.I would recommend this product!This is NOT difficult to put together, much easier than the dresser/changing tower I did last week.I put this together solo and I'm preggo!I love that it is all wood, no particle board, no plastic parts, and nothing movable either.The cherry is a true cherry and matches a cherry dresser we bought from a different maker perfectly.The shipping took a bit, but no big deal, it was free shipping.Best purchase!my husband was able to put it together pretty quickly.i will try to remember to update this review after baby.We chose espresso color and were not disappointed.Two things of note, my bumper doesn't seem to fit as snugly and not sure if it is my crib or bumper.Also, the rails do not come with crib (as many don't) but for some reason rails were hard to find when I tried to order separately.I finally found them on another website and ordered them.I looked at other websites who wanted a ridiculous amount for shipping.Amazon was free and that was fantastic, saved over $100 on shipping alone.Jan 2012 update - I am still using this crib and it has held up very well.Bought this over 2 years ago , so I cant' comment on the pricing now.The only thing it didnt' last was sub-standard movers.Paint job took some serious blows before it started to chip.I use a softtowel as a cover.It has some scratches but still is beautiful..I don't wear cloths with a belt or jewels because of the baby.bottom line: I'm happy with the buy and really think you will too.Update:My girl is now almost 7 months old...she's about 65cm tall, weights 8.3 kg.I can't imagine not having this dresser...It's well worth the money.The soft wood has been a little irritating, especially when my son wanted to try using the crib as a teething toy.But the crib is now showing any signs of wear.The crib is fairly easy to install, although you might probably need the help of a second person.I contacted the Company and they sent a replacement that took WAY TOO LONG (like 3 weeks), only to ALSO arrived scratched!!It is a very good investment because you have a crib, a toddler bed and a full size bed in one.WRONG!A few weeks after my son started to sleep in it, I noticed a 1.25" gap on the left/right side of the crib between the mattress and the crib slats.Their solution?They sent me ANOTHER Emily crib.it still had a 1.25" gap!!I emailed the company again and got a phone call from one of their product managers.He looked up the measurements of the crib and told me that there's a certain allowable gap between the mattress and crib and the Emily crib is on the higher end of the allowable gap size.He apologized that there was a gap and offered me their Kalani bed instead for free, which does not have a gap according to the crib measurements.However, with one crib upstairs and another disassembled downstairs, I wasn't about to have them send me a third crib!So I declined.Bottom line: know that this crib will have a gap with the Emily mattress.I stuffed three rolled up receiving blankets in the gap, just in case.Although I love the crib--the design, the sturdiness--I am disappointed to find out about this gap.I was always under the impression that the mattress should fit snugly on all sides in the crib.Buyer beware.I bought this crib in cherry for 245$, after reading every review about this and many other cribs and safety reports.My babygril is now 4 months old.she sleeps well in it.the cherry collor is just as you see it in the picture.I still have it on the highest mattress level, because my girl cannot situp on her own yet... but sometimes I wished it had a dropside because it gets harder lifting her out of her crib all the time, she's 7 kg now.. but then a dropside is dangerous.I would have given this product five stars, except it took almost a month to sort out a delivery snafu before we could actually get the crib together.This is the first time I've had a problem with an Amazon purchase and they weren't able to resolve it quickly (or technically, at all).The product itself seems great and it was top-rated on Consumer Reports (my main reason for ordering it).Assembly instructions were easy to follow, and didn't take long to put together.However, it was difficult and time-consuming to sort out problems with customer service, so I'm not 100% thrilled with the purchase.Initially, they only sent two legs (instead of four).When contacted, Amazon customer service told us we could either repack/return the entire crib (time-consuming & cumbersome) or request the missing parts from the manufacturer (Million Dollar Baby, "MDB") directly.Unfortunately, Amazon had no contact details for MDB, so we had to track it down ourselves via the MDB website.Even then, the only available contact method was via email (no phone).Does not require any special tools, and as long as you follow the directions it is very easy.It seems very easy to convert to a toddler bed.We didn't buy the rails for the full size bed because it seems a long time from now, however, I'm thinking that you don't have to buy the 100$ rails from DaVinci to get this working.:)Will try go get an update when the baby is here.Added Feb 2011:  We've had the crib for 4 months now.I'm sure this won't be a problem soon when he can sit up on his own.I was really just going according to Consumer Reports with this one.One note for people with small spaces: this crib curves out in the back and the front, so if you need it to fit a really small space, other cribs will fit the bill better.It is made of pine - a soft wood - so if  you're looking for a family heirloom, this may not be it.It took a little effort to put it together, but we have been using it for 5+ months with no issues.I never had to re-tighten the nuts and bolts.If you can get someone to help you put together I think it will be lot easier and quicker.Great purchase if you are looking to buy a crib!Hubby was a little frustrated putting together but it didn't take too long and turned out to be very beautiful and very sturdy.We also haven't had issues with fitting a mattress, the standard 28" X 52" mattress I received free from a coworker fit perfect (very snugly but after we put the fitted sheet on it actually slid in pretty easily).Our mobile mounted easily, no problem.This is also a nice looking table.However, I am only giving it a 3 star rating because of the danger the open slots pose for the baby's limbs.As such his legs and arms are constantly getting stuck within the gaps!I find it very aggravating to have to remove his arms and legs from within these gaps each and every time I change his diaper."However, I have to mention two problems.First, it takes over 30 minutes, even longer than the time needed to assembly the crib!!I wanted anything that'd help.This mat is nice & not expensive but we didn't use it much.I recently purchased the White Door Guardian Patio Door Lock and while it does it's job there are a few issue I have with it.1)  It's not white.Its an off white and no where near the normal disigner white that a patio door is.2)  The Product Description states, "There is no drilling required , just run 2 screws into a keeper plate provided and then into the upper track."I can tell you right now you will be doing soem drilling.In fact it comes with a cutout to help with the drill locations.I figuired based off the decsiption that the keeper plate would need to be mounted in the upper track using screws but you also have to screw the lock system into the door itself.It comes with 4 screws that need to be predrilled to mount itself to the door.3)  Shipping cost was too much for such a small product.Only reason I went with it dispite the cost was the fact that I was mislead to believe there was no drilling required.In the end if you want a sliding door lock this will work but in my shoes I feel a little cheated.It's garbage now - never to be purchased again.My daughter has been wearing "wearable blankets" since she was a newborn (she liked to be swaddled.Now she's 21 months old but is still wearing these.Pros:-stays on the child throughout the night-warm-safer than blankets (I once gave her a blanket and found it wrapped around her head; she was trying to make a 'hat' for herself)-easy to put on and off-water resistant (she gets some water sometimes before bed and the beads just roll off)-zipper is "upside down" so she can't unzip it herself-cozy-sleeveless design helps her arms stay free and mobileCons:kind of pricey ($20) plus $7 s/h!but totally worth it!Can't find these in the store (BRU and Target only carry the smaller sizes)* NO VELCRO - The velcro on the Swaddle Me kept waking our daughter up and sticking to everything in its path.It has a "pocket" where the baby's feet go in, and two little "wings" that you wrap around each arm.Then there's a very long piece that you can wind around your baby.My recommendations are:Hudson Baby Organic Receiving Blanket, a 40"x40" blanket.Whether it was colic or his temperament, we'll never know.But it was a tough time for us.Finally, a combination of the Miracle Blanket, theGraco Lovin' Hug Swing, Barcelona Bluegrass, and a close reading ofThe Happiest Baby on the Block: The New Way to Calm Crying and Help Your Newborn Baby Sleep Longerallowed us to get a little sleep.We never really swaddled his legs -- just his arms.He now sleeps like a champ.The blanket is definitely showing some wear, but it is in no way compromised by all the hard use.One big help to us was tucking my son's hands in the foot pouch.It didn't change his position at all, but definitely made it harder for him to get his hands out as he got older.on top.This helped him stay in the Miracle Blanket a bit longer each night, but mainly served the purpose of preventing the Miracle Blanket from sliding up to his shoulders and neck when he got out.He sleeps independently and unswaddled, with little fanfare when we finally stopped.Even then, we didn't want to use it during all sleep time.His night sleeping improved when we started using it at bedtime, and his daytime naps got longer and more consolidated when we started using it for naps.You can tuck the animal in the Miracle Blanket to hold the pacifier within reach.We did this for months.I can't recommend it enough for infants.I can not say enough about this product.My little one liked to be swaddled.It gave my husband and I (any my little one too) the gift of many hours of extra sleep.Without M.B-->she would sleep 4 hours max.MORE THAN 6+ hours extra in a row!)It was a sad day when she outgrew it.She is verrrrrrrry long and grew out of it at ~4 mo.which is about when they should be transitioned to free-style sleeping (as I have been told anyway.)I buy this for all my expecting friends.P.S.Ignoring the 'straight-jacket' comments will be easy with all the extra rest you will be getting!This was great the first two months but my daughter outgrew it after that and could get her arms free easily.It is very handy the first two months, but it is kind of pricey for the short time period.The material is thin which is nice for summer, but the thin material easily rips and mine is 3 months old and already has a hole.I would recommend just purchasing a large thin blanket to swaddle.If you really have a hard time making a swaddle, this is handy.we have been swaddling our baby up in it since the day we brought her home from the hospital.She is now going on 4 months, and it is still used every single night.I have to lift the back to put the arm restraint on for each arm.Then at least 2-3 more times to wrap the left flap around the baby.This product is truly a miracle product.We also have a woombie and swaddleme and our baby hates both.my baby was 7lb,11oz and 20in at birth.he fit into this until he was 6 weeks old and then was too long.that's why i gave it 4 stars.it seemed like we didn't get as much use out of it for the price.i used it day and night.In particular, my wife and I have been much happier with theKiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Flannel, Small, Sage Gingham.The only area the Miracle Blanket wins out is in its softer material.This may make swaddling easier the first time compared to the kiddopotamus.Yet, after a few swaddles, you'll become fast and profficient enough to deal with flailing limbs.These flaps end up just being a hassle.The miracle blanket is so big that the bottom of the blanket is easily kicked off and my baby's feet shortly flail about, defeating the purpose of the swaddle.At least this allows or easier diaper changes.The kiddopotamus never comes undone, thanks to the velcro.Also the flannel kiddopotamus is the most constraining I hear.My son was somehow still able to wiggle his arm free, although I had followed all the directions and was using it properly.Maybe he is too big for it.I purchased the beige one.I guess I was expecting the fabric to be stretchier than it was.The colors are great, and the fabric is soft, thin, stretchy, and durable.If you use it twice a day with a fussy, fed, clean baby (ie, a baby who is probably overstimulated and doesn't have another more obvious complaint), you can literally change the quality of your life and that of your baby.Would use it in combination with the "Happiest Baby on the Block" video.Don't just buy 1.Buy at least 2 or 3.Along with a fun bottle drying rack, they're probably my favorite, not-entirely-necessary baby product.I had a friend tell me that I HAD to get this for my baby, so I did.Maybe if you have trouble swaddling, I can see how this would make it easier, but trust me - with a newborn, you do it enough to get the hang of it pretty quick.Couldn't live without this thing!Some babies NEED to be swaddled.Often, the baby that most needs to be swaddled is also very good at escaping from a regular blanket swaddle and waking himself up.This was our baby.We tried the Kiddopotamus swaddler, (which I think is a good product for most babies) without success.He was able to sneak his hands up and out of the neck hole.At 12 weeks we are still using it every night and for some naps.It always keeps him snug.It has even been great for the past few weeks that he has been in a Pavlik harness for hip dysplasia which doesn't allow for swaddling of the legs.We just wrap his arms and leave his legs out of the pocket and we never find it up around his face like we would with a regular blanket.Great product for a baby with busy arms!Darn!My little guy has never liked to have his arms swaddled so I should have known better than to buy it.I think if I had gotten it earlier like when he was a newborn it may have worked which is why I am still giving it 3 stars, but he was 2 months old when I got it and maybe already set on his sleeping preferences?He didn't like being wrapped in it, but allowed me to do it anyway and he did fall asleep.I checked on him 1/2 hour later and he had both legs out.Checked on him an hour later and he had both arms out!How I will never know, this thing is like a strait jacket!So unfortunately he didn't sleep any longer than normal...4 hours on the dot like always.One last thing, I think $19.99 is more reasonable than $29.99...it is only fabric!Up until 3-months it worked great.I didn't start using it until she was at least a month old and it made a huge difference in her sleep right away.Yes it is better and larger then Kiddopotamus Swaddling Blanket, yes it is well made quality, yes my baby hands stayed inside, yes it decrease his crying like 80% of the time, but I didn't give it 5 stars because it is so expensive for a simple blanket.I think 15$ will be fair price.We bought a second one so we will always have a clean one on hand.The only negative is that we have a very tall baby and at 2 1/2 months she is already too long for her legs to fit in the leg pocket.It was too many steps to swaddle the baby, and almost impossible to swaddle a cranky baby.My daughter did like it once she was swaddled, but in the morning when she was crying & kicking, the longer side of the wrap was wrapped around her neck, and her legs were already out.Dangerous!!We love this swaddle and now buy it for everyone we know having a baby!I was so excited about this product.Great design, instructions and texture.But after 2 days of being swaddled in the hospital my baby wanted NOTHING to do with this blanket or being swaddled.We even had the nurses try it out, just to make sure we were doing it right... and it was a 'no go'.So, I would wait and see if your child enjoys being swaddled.. then purchase this product.It think it would be very affective but because it is expensive I would hold off on the initial shopping spree until baby arrives.Side note- my baby also would not sleep on her back.She is 6 months old and has slept on her tummy/side and is perfectly healthy.But due to SIDS, please remember to try different approaches for back sleeping first before going with tummy sleeping.Wanted to mention this because swaddling requires them to sleep on their backs and this ended up not working for us.Best of Luck!When he's crying and fussy we can get him swaddled correctly, but he won't calm down.When he's super fussy, he will work his arms partially out and get caught.Then, we have to try and reswaddle him over and over and over!When our baby is already tired and calm, we can get him in this super fast and without fuss and he'll sleep swaddled and will sleep for an extra hour longer.Just be careful when swaddling with this to make sure the top of the cloth hits the shoulder directly, otherwise it will wiggle up towards his face when the baby moves.This product works for us about half the time.I purchased this product for my 5-week old very active baby.He is an active kicker at night and, despite being normal height/weight (11 lbs, 23") has quickly outgrown his newborn Halo & Kiddopotomous/Summer Infant swaddlers.I purchased this based on the great recommendations and have been fairly disappointed...especially with the lofty price tag.Pros:1) It does keep your baby snuggly swaddled with very little chance of their arms breaking free.Highly resembles a straight-jacket but I know my baby isn't crazy!Therefore, my 5-week old is already able to kick his legs and work his legs out the bottom.Within a few short weeks I doubt if he'll be able to put his legs straight!!This could cause problems as he gets stronger bc he could work the material up over his face.2) The wrap mechanism (although a pro bc of the lack of velcro & using their weight to keep secure) can be tedious at first, especially for a newborn.You have to tuck the arms & wrap the material around the baby, so you're either tipping the baby up on its neck to tuck & wrap or lifting it up & balancing on one hand3) Lack of upper-body movement.Because you have the arms so tightly bound but the legs can wiggle free, I feel like it might be confusing for the baby.Well...my problem continues!I am going to try to Woombie big-baby design & see if that is better for my little man.They beat the pants off of any other swaddler on the market today.The fabric is not heavy so there is no worry of over heating, but its still soft.These work as advertised and are a GOD send for making the baby feel safe and allowing them to fall asleep faster and sounder.When washing, dry on low or air dry.This is the most expensive swaddling aid we've bought and yet we failed to see the guaranteed miracle results.#1 - it's very big on our 1 month old and no matter how tightly we wrapped, there was always loose pockets somewhere#2 - although not rocket-science-complicated, it is not exactly the easiest thing either to put on your baby, especially with the last band that goes around & around#3 - it's made of a cheap jersey fabric (not worth the price of $25 we paid for the product)#4 - did not keep our fussy baby from startling herself awake any better than the other velco swaddling aides out thereMy baby is 6 months old and we are still using it just to swaddle her bottom part.(Her arms stay out because she is so long) My baby has always been in the 90th percentile for her weight and off the charts on her heighth and the blanket still worked great for her.I will mention that I've recently noticed a little hole where the wraps are, but it's nothing we can't fix by sewing.My daughter is only 4 months old and can bust out of it like the Hulk in a styrofoam building.At any rate, it does do it's job, but it's frustrating that she keeps getting out, lol!Chews on the knotted hands and feet, the ears are great for gnawing.Such a soft and cozy lovie -- we "love" it, especially since it's made from organic cotton.I throw it in the washer and dryer and it comes out great.Was desperately looking for a replacement to my 1-year old's current lovey - named Lenny, naturally.This one (now named Kenny) is really quite nice and has lots of "legs" to chew, but whilst the little one does chew them, Kenny isn't competitive with Lenny.The toy is well made.My only comment is that the head is completely stuffed with padding so if you are anti-dryer or try to avoid wasting power then this lovey will not be for you (or you will need 2 so you can leave one to dry for days to ensure the head isn't wet).It seems to be the only toy my 4 month old doesn't throw down.He likes to chew on the feet and ears and I don't have to worry about him getting tangled or choking on anything.Very happy it's machine washable and organic too!We might have to buy another one to keep on hand for overnight trips or if this one gets lost!Washing not so bad but its really hard to get it completely dry, a moldy toy mama does not likeBut nope.Nada.It's still cute though!My daughter is just starting to teeth at 9 months and we've had this since she was 4 months- it's boring...nothing about it makes her want to go near it lol.If it had a rattle she might be sold.I thought it was really cute I bought a bunch of them only to find out she could care less.She likes the Sophie the Giraffe- that's the best.Also it washes really well in the washing machine.Not every baby loves every toy, but if you get it cheap enough it is nice to try.It is an eco friendly product that I do not have to worry about my son chewing on it.This grape toy is so cute, and well-made.If they had spaced the leaves just a little bit to the left, it would have either a space or just a little leaf that wouldn't cover the face should it curl up.Have had it for baby from 5 months to 1 year old...I suppose it will be useful as a pretend toy when baby is older.It's a shame he has not enjoyed as the collection of fruits and veggies is adorable.I guess I'm glad I didn't break down and buy the whole lot.We wanted something that didnt have to be closed but could be extended to close off a very large doorway, but then could be closed if we needed it to be.I opened it up and, without reading the directions, realized how to tighten and loosen it.But it is flimsy.As I sat it up, my mother-in-law and I shook our heads and lamented that it probably wouldnt work.But in came my monkeys and, once the realized the gate was there, they used it to stand up on, but that was it.All in all, I'd give it a 7-8 out of 10.Afterwards, I tried closing it and it is SMALL!So, instead of ordering the extension, I'm just ordering a second one.In size, it gets a 4 out of 10, but in flexibility with sizing, a 9 out of 10.Finally, we selected this one because it can be staked to the ground outside and can function as an indoor/outdoor playyard.After a while the tighteners started falling off and worse yet, dropping itty bitty screws randomly without warning.As you all know a 1 year old WILL put shiny little things in their mouths.Three times now I have found screws on the floor from the gates.It's something I will contact consumer services about since I think these screws are a complete danger/choking hazard to toddlers, and pets for that matter.I purchased 2 of these sets and trying to contact the company is a JOKE.They want the gates back, they want ME to ship them back and then wait for weeks for a possible replacement, if THEY find them to be defective, YEAH OK!!I love that the water is more or less fresh - as baby started to grow the flow was a little more obstructed so that meant that the 'old' water was stuck on the side of her that didn't have the drain - but that's ok.I love that the thermometer told me when the water was getting too hot, which happens occasionally as toilets are flushed or other baths are run in the house.I also loved the water reservoir that allowed me to dip the cup into it for fresh water to rinse her hair.It did leak out of each of the drainage holes, which wasn't a huge deal because the water was constantly running, and we used it over the double sink.My only wish is that it fit babies for a longer period of time.Her head sticks out too much, so when I wash her hair the water goes outside the tub instead of staying inside, and she got so large that the volume of water around her was quite small.The tub comes with two levels - you can plug the bottom hole to make the water level higher, but because of how it fit on my sink, I couldn't use the higher level because every time my daughter splashed (which was, well, all the time), the water would come out the side and soak me or the countertop.Overall, I'd buy it again and wish I had it with my older child!Leighton looks comfy and gets clean - easy peasy.Still, the tub did what it was supposed to do in our standard-sized/shaped kitchen sink and accomodated Leighton until she could sit up in a regular tub.The tub fits nicely into my double sink (you can use this in a single sink as well).It also comes with an adaptor if there are different sink heights.Some reviews stated they leaked.. mine have not (yet) but even if they did, I'd still love this tub to use in the sink.She doesn't play to much yet, but I felt the water level was just right.A bath is a bath... but this is a comfy one for mom and baby.My daughter slants a bit in the tub, but still quite safe and nothing one of those space mats can't fix (for a newborn I'd definately recommend one of those mats as they can really slip in) This tub is a step up because of the extra features that make it easier on mom or dad.I've tried 4 other tubs.. and this one tops them all.The first 3 I returned immediately after trying and retrying.I love it for the fact that I know my daughter isn't sitting in dirty bath water when I'm bathing her.I haven't experience any problems like other people have stated such as the temp not working or it leaking.It will leak if you close the drain valve on the side so that the water is high in the part where the baby sits.When my daughter starts to splash around the water will come out the hole but that's expected I think.I love that she doesn't have to sit in dirty water and that I don't have to guess the water temperature.A padded insert would be very helpful.I put a towel inside (avoiding the drainage holes), and that seems to help quite a bit.There is a reservoir in front to catch the water coming out of the faucet and then that spills over into the shallow tub area for your baby.It comes with a cup for washing your baby and the bath has two holders for the cup, which is very convenient.The major problem I had with this tub is the thermometer.The fact that this tub had the thermometer was the reason we purchased it, but the thermometer broke after three months.One day it just started flashing and making a buzzing noise, and replacing the batteries had no effect.So we had to go out and purchase a tub thermometer anyway, which is what we were trying to avoid in the first place.I was disappointed that the thermometer wasn't made to last longer.If I had known that it was not going to hold up, I probably would have purchased a less expensive bathtub with a separate water thermometer.Ugh.They really need to put instructions on the thing.The slightest touch would topple it.Pull on the metal clasp and pull the bars apart.Then put the gate in the doorway, put the metal bit that sits in the grooves into the groove you want, and push down the top bar like a big lever, snapping it to the lower bar.Finally, it is secure in the door!!It is thick and "luxurious".I liked the first one so much, i bougt the second one for another room.They're probably both equally secure, but this one makes ME feel safer because the four sides make it harder for my baby to wiggle out.This vinyl pad doesn't require a cover, but I use one anyway.The length would serve us well when my son grows.We have hard water and it had to many small spots to get yucky.Threw out pretty quick.Was kind of hard to so it would rally help if they got to close.The opening where the knob goes was not long enough so my shower pull knob doesnt fit in the allotted slot, and the whole thing just falls right into the water.this cover deters him from the tub and faucet!she loves the waterfall effect it has.easy clean up too.just soak in in bleach a little but when i clean up her other bath toys and it's good as new.I don't have issues with nasty mildew with mine as other's have reported in their reviews.My newborn actualy doesnt need this yet, BUt when the time comes we will have it.its great for when taking a bath and rinsing your hair out so we dont bop out head on the faucet and the water projects & fans outward for a nice waterfull effect when filling up the bathtub when winding down for the evening.Im sure my newborn will appreciate this much as me when he gets to use it too!UPDATE: 1 year later... broke the thing wore out and it falls off the faucet and my little 9 month old just pulls it right off the faucet.What a nifty little bunch of toys.It also comes with two shower poofs which kids like too.Ball!Ball!Ball!FYI: I read a previous review that said the balls smelled of PVC, but I don't think they are.I think they're some other material (not a material identification by smell expert) like rubber.I contacted Boon directly through their website and this is what they responded back with:"To answer your question about the Boon Bath Goods, the shapes and the scrubbies in the Bath Goods are BpA-Free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free.The following details the materials that our Bath Goods are made of:~ The Bath Goods shapes are made of EVA foam.~ The scrubbies are made of polyethylene.~ The original Bath Goods bath balls are BpA-free and Phthalate-free.Because of consumer concerns about PVC in general, we are now including a different type of bath ball in our new Bath Goods sets.The new ball is BpA-free, Phthalate-free, and PVC-free.Again, the original bath ball does not contain any phthalates that have been identified as being harmful...The older version has a matte finish and the new balls are shiny."Also, if you have purchased the older version with matte balls and are concerned, I would suggest contacting Boon directly as they are likely to ship you the newer PVC-free balls to replace your old balls.Great product & Great company!She loves to take them into the tub, the pool, and just play with them.She is four now and hasn't tired of them at all!!Cute product, and shipped fast.As for the specifics that you are all probablly wondering about: quality, safty, etc...I can not comment as this was given as a gift.I have gotten pictures with the kids (all under 1) playing and enoying this toy.The body support is great, however our daughter's head never stayed properly in place even with both this support & the car seat's head support cushion.We ended up getting a completely different head support that actually worked.Bought for my baby when he turned 10 months and started feeding himself and making a royal mess everywhere.He hated his old standard plastic high chair (graco, typical type) from day 1.Before buying the Boon Flair I did briefly consider the Stokke because I liked the idea of pulling my kid straight up to the table-- however Stokke is WAY more $ and online videos of kids tipping themselves over freaked me and that was the end of that.I also love the ease of washing, drip drying, and storing the much smaller tray and tray liners.Some people don't like the small size, I totally love it vs. the monstrous plastic graco tray we had before.One note on the sleek modern design, too, because I was nervous about this element because I am not a real "modern design" person at all, and we have kind of a "country kitchen" with copper and gold tones and a bunch of plants and a 1980s style cheesy wooden dining set...but I feel this modern style high chair is just a nice clean look, in general, it blends in fine and it looks WAY better then the classic plastic monstrosity we had before.Here are my few minor annoyances, every product has some and I find it helpful to read other people's reviews that list the bad along with the good so I can sort out what the dealbreakers for me would be.None of these, for me, are a big deal obviously since I gave this product 5 stars, but in an ideal world, these elements would be better:  1) the lap belt clip closure sort of jams up right where the tray/t-bar all come together with baby's belly, so I feel like I have to manuever it around to get it comfie for my guy, plus its so snugged up at that particular point it's nearly impossible to unsnap the tray liner off the base tray while baby is in the chair too.3) the tray removal mechanism is a little bit of a "thing" to get the hang of, and I still have to think about what I'm doing to get it to latch/unlatch 4) the base tray (which is NOT dishwasher safe, although I personally don't care about that) has some open spaces related to the latch mechanism -- this just means that after washing it you need to fully turn it on end and drain it so you don't accidentally dump dishwater all over your baby when you put the tray over him next time.There are a few baby products that I have felt have been worth every penny -- My Ergo, babyjogger city elite stroller, fuzzibunz perfect size diapers, and this high chair!5 stars :)After owning 6 Peg Peregos and one Stokke, (Don't ask, I have a bit of a high chair and stroller fetish).I wanted to find something easier to clean.Our last Peg ended up with bugs.My daughter has the kitchen domain and she diligently wiped the high chair after every meal but I was having a difficult pregnancy and failed to mention that food gets in the crevices and you have to take the seat off and clean under it.So, out that high chair went.I researched several high chairs and read every review on this one.That said, I Love the no barka lounger for eating and this is what makes no crevices.Straps are very flimsy and my 16 month old just pulls them down and slides out of them.Our first meal in this chair was spaghetti, I immediately wiped it down but it was stained.For the most part, this is an ordinary album with a few stickers to personalize it.I'll be ordering more of these as a  new mom taking WAY too many pictures of my little girl!Doesn't look cheap and well made.I haven't had any problems of it being cheap or the plastic pages ripping.I love the fact you can put your own baby's foot/hand print on the cover (there is also a page for more feet or hand prints!)I made my own envelope page for the 1st haircut, and then just taped things in the book.I taped the hosptial bracelets on the inside cover and greeting cards throughout the book.It's just so pretty and presentable.I didn't care for this book.I have 3 kids and work full-time and I just don't have that kind of time.I wanted to return it - the company gave me the run around for a week and then told me it was too late to return it ( had been 29 days and they allow only 30 - including shipping time).Would NOT buy from this seller again!Unfortunately I felt this baby book gave half an effort on both sides.There are plenty of pages to put your pictures in as every left page is blank for this purpose.The topic pages were just lacking.Sure there was info about mom, dad, a family tree page, first Christmas etc.and included pages for 1-6 birthdays, which I thought was a little excessive seeing as it was a "baby book," but when it came down to other information you may want to record it was severely lacking.I wish I had written down the pages before I sent it back to give you more an idea of what they left out but I can say I did not send it back because it didn't have cutesy pictures or because I thought the blank picture pages were just too much.This baby book would appeal to those with a more modern or minimalist taste.It does not contain cutesy pictures, rather allows you to place your own cute baby pictures in it.The left page is for the pictures, which are self-applied with the provided photo corners.Therefore, you can put virtually any size pictures.The page on the right cover a different topic.Some of these include one for mom, where you can put your name birthdate, places you've lived, schools you attended, hobbbies.There is one for daddy.There is a page for how mommy and daddy met.One page is about how you found out you were pregnant.Overall I'm completely satisfied with the book and it suits my needs.I purchased this Hat to use it with the Bundleme also by JJ Cole since they are made from the same material.When I opened the box and took it out, it looked HUGE!Since my baby is only 2 months old, I thought this will not fit until he is like 5 months old!How wrong I was!It looks big on the outside, but the opening for the head is actually on the small side.I had difficulty using this hat with my baby who is only 2 months old because he kept complaining and almost crying when having this on his head as iif it was too tight.I had to use brute strength to stretch it out a bit and then he was a bit happier, but not much.This hat is super cute!I was hoping this would fit my newborn, as she was born in cold december in Maine, but it is WAY to big for my newborn's head.I washed and dried it, and it doesn't appear that it shrunk the hat at all.but extremely tight!I will be trying that so my baby can hopefully get some use from this.If you want a soft-hanging organizer, this is the best you'll get.It does tip forward a bit, as any hanging fabric organizer will, but it has compensated for that with pocketed shelves (as opposed to open shelves like on theDex Products Ultimate Baby Organizerwhere everything slides right off).It fits everything I need in the organizer, whereas with theDex OrganizerI had to use an extra TV table tray to handle the overflow.It actually holds the diapers in!If you want something sturdier, you'll have to go with hard plastic, because you won't find a better fabric organizer.This thing needs LOTS of improvement and I don't understand why they haven't been made after all of the complaints.There is NO WAY I would pay full price for this thing.Love the idea but I guess this was just not one of those things that I really needed.), crackers and similar but are not so good for Goldfish, Cheerios or raisin-sized snacks if your little one is like mine - mine would hold it upside down and shake, or carry it by the lid with his hand partially inside.Once I figured this out, it became a lot easier.I can loop a bottle-catcher through the handles and attach to a sling or bag, which means I have a hands-free snack catcher while we're out and about.The snack catcher isn't fool-proof, but it does help keep the snacks in the cup.It is also nice because my son drops (or throws) his cups down a lot, and the snack catcher keeps everything inside when he does that, too.We run into trouble when my son holds the plastic slots open and turns it upside down, which leads to the cereal falling out.I'm not holding that against the snack catcher in my rating; I'm just noting that kids can find a way to spill if they want to.It takes only turning them upside down or shaking them a little for the snacks to totally fly out and all over the place.Our 18 month old has a small bowl of cheerios in the morning that he is allowed to eat in his reading chair.Well, his new favorite game has been shaking the bowl and we end up with cheerios all of the floor.He can still eat his cereal like a "big boy" and we don't have to deal with the "little boy" mess.We do still end up with some cheerios on the floor, but that is mostly from him wanting to get as big of a handful as he can.I can't attest to how well these work in the car or "on the go" as we don't allow snacks in the car.As other people have noted about kids making a mess, by grabbing a handful...they do it 1) If they are not hungry anymore 2) Playing "fill and dump" (as most toddlers at this age do.I'd give it a higher rating if it had a SEALED LID!Clever idea in the picture posted...using an 8oz sour cream lid.My only complaint is the lack of a lid so I can store in in my diaper bag already to go.Very glad I bought these!We use them a lot in the car.My backseat used to be covered in snacks and crumbs, but not with these.We also use them in the house for goldfish, crackers... all sorts of snacks.It took my son a while to get the hang of this snack cup.Once we put a suitably enticing snack in, though, he got over his qualms and now has no trouble getting his hand in or snacks out.The manufacturer's claim that it's spill-proof is just plain silly, though.Yes, you can invert it and nothing falls out (except maybe a few cheerios, since they're small and can slip sideways through the flaps).Anything cereal-like tends to have this problem.The biggest problem we have with this snack cup is that now when my son sees it and knows he's getting snacks, he sometimes gets so excited that he loses his balance and falls over.I have a 1 year old and she makes a mess with these cups!She takes handfuls of whatever is in the cup, pulls it out and dumps it on the floor!I haven't seen anything better at helping contain cereal and other snacks.When turning it upside-down and shaking, some of the cereal comes out, but not much.The food also lasts longer in a Snack Catcher (fewer refills), since more food stays inside instead of getting thrown overboard.Of course, a determined child can still throw all of the contents out and make a mess.This isn't going to keep your toddler from making a mess, but it can be better than a regular cup or bowl.My son was hesitant about putting his hand in the top at first, but he doesn't have a problem with it anymore.I like it for when we're at a store, because he will generally only drop a piece or two by accident.If he tips it over or shakes it, the cereal stays inside.But, when he walks around with it at home I will find cereal scattered in small amounts all over the house.So it probably wouldn't be a good thing to let him have it at a friend's house, unless they have a dog who likes cheerios.I got these about a month ago and so far they have been really great!It's also great when I take him shopping - after awhile he gets stir-crazy in the shopping cart, which is when I pull out this secret weapon :)Condensation has developed inside both the mirror turtle and the rattle turtle in our set.In fact, the rattle doesn't make noise because the beads are stuck to the side.The entire set also tends to flip upside down when in the water.We still have these next to the tub, and they do provide a little visual interest from time to time, but I would not buy these again or recommend them unless the company makes some design changes.If you are unfortunate enough to have plunked down the money like I did, remember to store the spinning turtles upside down so that the water can drip out between uses.I bought this product despite several reviews that said it did not work well.I thought this product would be a great addition to several other crib toys I have for them.I choose toys that I think both boys will enjoy as buying two of everything can get expensive.I had this product added to my wish list for a long time in the hopes of one day purchasing it.When I finally got around to ordering the product, I could not wait to receive it and see if my twins enjoyed it.Once it arrived my husband and I put brand new batteries in the product and to our suprise it did not work at all!!!We tried other batteries thinking it just may be the batteries and it still did not work.We even went as far as having family members trying to get it to worth thinking maybe we were simply overly tired parents.I wish I could say better things about this product as the description was exactly what I was looking for in a crib toy.Not only didn't it work well, but in our case it didn't work at all!!!I will be returning the product in the hopes of having my money refunded.SOUNDS AND LIGHTS ARE LOVELY... but  when its in the voice mode it doesn't turn on quick, it takes about 50 sec of real LOUD crying before it turns on (it is inside the crib).By the time it turns on, the baby is really upset and sounds and lights are not enough anymore, so I'd rather get up and turn it on manually before the baby gets upset.*A good thing is that it doesn't turn on when you are talking, I tested it by speaking loud and very close to it and it didn't turn on... it turns on, only with crying sounds*  I WISH IT COULD BE  MORE  SENSITIVE TO CRYING LIKE SOUNDS... those sounds that baby makes before it starts the real loud crying.I would recommend it because it really sooths a baby!It does save space and allow you to better organize the baby food, but because the shelves slide to lock, spinning the contraption from any shelf other than the base results in the shelves dropping onto the one below.Just something to consider before you buy.I was excited to get this, but when I got it, it was not that great.Also its very flimsy to me.I wouldnt get it again.I do however like how you can put spoons in the middle.We opted to get the one without the hammock and we have not needed it.When bathing our newborn, I just had to keep one hand on his head to keep him from leaning too far onto one side.Now, at 4 months old, he's almost ready to use the sitting up side of the tub.I do wish they made a version that folds up for easier storage, but a friend of mine owns one that folds up and it leaks all over the place.We started with the Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Fold Away Baby Bath to try to save space; which it really didn't save all that much space.It has a little compartment to hold your shampoo and soap, so you don't have to reach or turn your head away from the baby.I place this tub in our standard tub while washing him and just turn it over to dry it out when we are finished with it.But, from the looks of the product now that it has arrived, I think it will be great!Even though my preschooler is 4 years old, I still use this when we go out to public restrooms.great for covering the seat for little ones who are not able to squat or understand the dangers of the public potty!The sticky tabs are key.So far, these are the only training pants that I have tried that have worked for me to last through an accident and not leak all over the place.For the reusable potty training pants out there, these are absorbant enough so it doesn't leak through, soft on the outside so it doesn't resemble a plastic bag on his bum, and allows for him to feel the wetness to realize that he's had an accident.I read all the reviews before purchasing these training pants for my daughter and knew well in advance that they are training pants, not diaper substitutes.The crotch has four layers of extra material, one of which is a 'waterproof' layer of polyurethane laminated polyester.The elastic is fully encased in jersey cloth, and the leg holes are jersey as well.The pants, ultimately are thicker than Gerber training pants, for example, but not bulky.The do a moderately better job of containing small accidents, as one would expect.The prints are cute and appealing to kids, though the Jungle/Zoo print's material is not as soft as the Farm animals material.It's also bleached white, where the farm animal material is (perhaps unbleached?)off-white.However, I did not primarily buy these as heavy-duty trainers.I bought them, because after my daughter broke out in a horrific rash after wearing Old Navy pants last year that were made in China of God-only-knows what kinds of materials, dyes and chemicals, I made the switch to Oeko-Tex 100 certified clothing for my children, with a preference to organically grown materials.These training pants are both organic and Oeko-Tex 100 certified; meaning they've been tested for over 100 dangerous or suspect chemicals in environments that mimic wearing conditions (ie.they go through sweat tests and things of that sort).The highest standards and chemical limits are applied to baby and children's clothes which are worn directly against the skin.And that's what I shelled out a whopping $15 per pair for.My daughter has worn these training pants on a handful of occasions thus far, each time coming away with a widespread pinpoint rash.Does the material contain sweat that causes a rash?Despite the certification, is there are chemical compoenent that is bothering her skin?I don't have the answer to any of those questions.And I'm really, really disappointed.These things were expensive, and the one quality I'd hoped to attain was a training pant that didn't induce rashiness.If you feel sure that this isn't a situation that would duplicate itself on your child and are set on buying these anyway, I would also note as well that these pants run small in the waist.They fit everywhere but the waist, which is too tight and absurdly small considering the proportions of kids this age.I'd recommend ordering up a size if your child is sort of in between sizes.Imse Vimse products are all made in Sweden.These work great but they are a little costly for underwear.But the more I looked at them, I realized that it wasn't actually bad at all - it was actually excellent!Check out the wiki page on this to get a better feel for how good this sugar alcohol is.My kids are not old enough to realize that they can't swallow the toothpaste and I still need to keep their teeth clean ...As a side note, they use Xylitol in chewing gum.In fact it is in many of the more expensive chewing gum brands that promote healthy teeth.This is the only beginner toothpaste we use in our house.Check out the wiki page on Xylitol  and I can say pretty confidently that you will use this as your only toothpaste with kids that may swallow their toothpaste.Other than the Xylitol, the rest of the ingredients are pretty innocuous and are claimed to be all natural.This product duo has been a breath of fresh air!My baby likes the taste of the past and prefers the finger brush so much more than the other styles.I am so glad to have found a solution, she had 2 teeth by 5 months and is currently popping out her 8th tooth on her 10 month birthday.This little gal is in need of brushing :)Funny I never gave it much thought about cleaning the babies gums with toothpaste, until I saw this product.Then when the first teeth start coming in using the little finger brush (included), which is very soft, to get baby used to the idea of oral care.They're never to young to learn, so why not start out as early as you can.The toothpaste tastes ok, too!!!Leave it to Nuk & Gerber to come up with this great product.I would recommend it to all my friends with new babies.No matter how often I tell her "no", it is hard for her to get the concept that when I put something in her mouth, she is not to chomp down on it with all her might.Plus, she has now bitten off a couple of the silicone bristles and they are no where to be seen.So, overall I understand the concept of this toothbrush and it may be great for younger babies, perhaps with no teeth.But I'm definitely looking for something in between this and a regular hard-bristled toddler toothbrush.Inside this package they give you spacers to fit the product to the toilet.Three spacers is too loose on the rim and four spacers is too tight.(The clamp won't fit over the top of the rim without snapping in half.The spacers fall off anyway.)It says in the directions that it'll work when slightly loose.Well, when it's slightly loose, it slightly POPS OFF the toilet.Isn't very useful when it won't even attach to the toilet.I refuse to spend extra money and time fitting adhesive or rubber onto the inside of this gadget.It's going back.I'll just close the bathroom door.It's free and guaranteed to work!Our toilet is a brand new American Standard--nothing out of the ordinary.Don't waste your time or money with this thing.I got this lock when my daughter flushed a shampoo cap and we had to buy a new toilet!!She would slide it from side to side.I think your better off just keeping the door shut when you are not with the child... We ended up removing it after about two weeks of being annoyed by it sliding and twisting arnd.It took a while to figure out how it worked, but once i didn, it works fine.It's a bit in the way when you sit.I hated this toilet latch!It did not fit tight enough on our toilet.Would not reccomend.We have a brand new toilet, so I figured it would work, not so.This system is horrible, we received it as a gift and without a gift receipt otherwise I would have return this product.How they expect you to push through the spring loaded gate with a filled spoiled diaper is beyond me.This product should be discontinued and the design engineer fired.Skip this and get the Elite.It makes so much more sense with hands free step on to open the gate(just like most of the kitchen trash can.)It receives one star because it does trap the diapers well and there is no smell coming from it.(I disagree with other reviewers giving low stars cause you pay a premium for their proprietary trash bags, you know this buying into the product, it should be no surprise.In addition, this is how most company milk you for money, its an old business tactics modeled after the razor blade cartridges)Locks in some odors I imagine but not odor free by any means.We keep a box of baking soda in the bottom of it to help and still have to change the bag every two days.I don't know how I ever made it without a Diaper Genie!It is super easy to use--highly recommend that if you use disposable diapers to buy this product.I liked the product but it doesn't completely keep the odor sealed.I think when the bag get so tight with lots of diaper inside, it prevents the flap from closing completely.I wonder if odor is able to penetrates thru the plastic bag.The refill cartridge are also expensive and I go thru so many.Didn't learn until much later that I should have thrown peepee diapers in trash and keep only poopy diapers in the diaper genie.I have a love/hate relationship with this product.We are on our either our second or third in a 1 year span...I have lost track.This is what has caused the returns in the past.EXPENSIVE refills that are needed probably each month.Awkward removal of waste bag.Love:Contains the smell mostly.I don't have to touch anything gross.Sleek exterior design is unobtrusive and blends in with nursery.In all, I have just come to terms with the fact that I will probably be buying a diaper waste system yearly to keep it from getting stinky or gross and because I don't think that they are designed to hold up over time.I may try a different option next time that works with trash bags, and not specific refills.bought a lot of these to toddler proof my kitchen.Not to hard to install but not "easy" at all as it takes time and drill skills :) Anyway the reason why I am writing this review is because these have been in my house now for a year and used daily, they are hard to open even by an adult, after a year the catch plastic is bending and missing so some drawers open or close on fingers, ouch, 2 have broken the catch as this is the weak point.Good idea how it catches and doesn't let slam on toddler fingers but after a year of toddler abuse and adult abuse @ 5am they are bending,breaking and just missing or not working.We got these for our kitchen drawers so the toddler would stay out of them.They were a pain in the butt to install in the drawers but every drawer lock is a pain.They do what we wanted them to do but if the drawer just gets pulled out some of the way, it stays that way.I know that's so fingers don't get smashed but it's just irritating for an adult.Overall, it does what it's meant to do.I'll just be glad when we don't need them anymore!I have mixed feelings about this fridge lock.It seems to work pretty well as designed, and i had no problems with the adhesive as so many other people did.It's also easy enough for kindergarten-age kids to figure out; my 5-year old can get into the fridge with no problem.I can do it, but I have very large hands.I don't think my wife can.Also, to do it I have to use the non-intuitive hand: i.e.the fridge opens on the left side but I have to use my right hand to get the lock open one-handed.I've gotten so used to this, though, that I barely even think about it anymore.2) It's not the most durable lock.A determined 2-year old can break the long plastic pieces with enough determination by bending them backwards (assuming the fridge door is already open).My middle child, who turned 3 last month, broke the top "tine" about 6 months ago, which was easily fixed with some duct tape; but this weekend he broke the bottom "tine" and now the lock has reduced function (even with more duct tape applied to both tines).I'm going to have to replace it.Seems like I should get more than a year's use out of this product.All in all I can't say I dislike the product; it's been very effective keeping our kids out of the fridge.But I also feel like it didn't last long enough to get a 4- or 5-star rating.It works, but like everything else these days it's not high-quality and has a limited life.It was QUITE annoying to put together, it took me over an hour as there is nothing to hold the bottom slats in place.However, now that its all together, it does look quite cute.I'm a little concerned that the bed rails are a little too short in height and length, but time will tell.It is a nice, sturdy rocking horse.I was expecting a rather large rocking horse that my daughter would be able to use for the next few years.When assembled, it looks like she may outgrow it as early as three.Just keep the smaller stature in mind.With this one we just swing it open and swing it close with no problem.Since our dog weighs only 10lb this gate is durable and sufficient from her knocking it down somehow.I am not sure how well it will hold up with a bigger dog or a toddler.Overall, I really like it since it was really cheap compared to petco and it seems well made too.Comes with screws too.Just make sure to use a plastic anchor if you are installing this on hollow drywall.I did this after a week or so of opening and closing the gate was loose.It's made almost entirely of plastic, but it's plenty sturdy to keep a toddler from breaking through it.You should be aware that this is designed to attach to a *flat* wood or drywall surface on both sides.I managed to attach it to our metal stair railing by securing a 1x3 to a post with U-bolts and screwing the brackets into the 1x3.It is not the easiest to latch or unlatch, so I would not necessarily recommend it for a high-traffic area.Daughter sleeps well on it, although the mattress is a little loud.I suppose that's good because it means it's waterproof.I was a little worried about purchasing this mattress after reading some of the other reviews, but after it was delivered we were pleasantly surprised.It fits snuggly in our DaVinci Kalani Crib, there is no space between the mattress and the crib bars.It feels like an adult mattress which our son loves.Another review mentioned that it makes a loud crinkly noise when you lay the baby on it but we haven't had that problem.So far so good.My 16 month old has slept on the mattress for about a month now and one side of it is flat.We have her crib converted to a toddler bed and the mattress is  now lower than the toddler railing is.I'm not sure if that's where she sleeps for the most part, or what, but I'm getting a new mattress here soon.It is also very loud when I lay her down, it sounds like she's laying on plastic bags.I've never had a mattress sound like that, not even the super cheap one from Walmart that we had for my oldest.If you're going to get a mattress, get a Sealy.My middle daughter has one that was one of my friends' who's daughter is almost 6 and the thing is almost brand new.It's the Sealy Baby Ultra Rest one.I purchased this product to match the DaVinci Emily Crib we bought 5 months ago.I was a little concerned about the quality of the material used for this product based on other reviews, but the product is as good as any other particle board product can be.The packaging was good, the wood finish is good (and matches with the crib) and more importantly it was quite easy to put together.I would strongly recommend this product along with the crib (see my separate review for the crib).were there, all the holes were well-drilled and centered, and everything fit together just as it should.I did nearly all of it by myself, in about three hours.The finished dresser is beautiful and has plenty of storage for all of my daughter's clothes.Would work better maybe for older children who are less likely to slam little fingers.Our daughter now uses it during her nap in pre-school.These have turned out to be her two favorite colors!I put it in my baby's crib to sleep on.Other than that, it's a great product, a must have for winter babies.This thing is great!It's more like an apron than a bib, really.It's machine washable, and easily wipeable between meals if you don't want to throw it in the machine.Great product!Fits well...only thing I can think to improve this bib would be to have longer sleeves but it does provide a little coverage on the arms.I've always loved Bumkins bibs but as my daughter got older, the bibs got smaller and her messes got bigger.This Bumkins bib saved many clothes from being stained and covered in food.Even my daughter loves this bib.We hang all our bibs up and she goes straight for this Supersized bib whenever she's hungry and hands it to us to place around her neck.Even she doesn't like spilling her mess on her shirt and pants.Details:The single food pocket on this bib is slightly larger than theBumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Unisex, 3-PackThe bottom half is generously wide and can cover a lot and works great in restaurant high chairs.The only difficulty you might experience is if you're still using a high chair with a snap-on tray.However with a little tug here and a pull there it will still work.This bib has saved me soooo much time cleaning up after soup spills and spaghetti spills.I purchesed these bibs because the reviews were great.I totally agree.At first I thought these bibs were thin and were not going to catch anything.Everyone comments on them.They are gender neutral and very cute.The bibs can be wiped clean in between uses and hung to dry.By the next time you want to use them, they are ready to go!I do throw them in the washing machine from time to time and hang dry, to clean off the food that doesn't completely come off by handwashing.The are expensive but worth the price and hold up well, and you don't end up scrubbing baby food out of clothes!Both have their purpose, but really they are the best bibs!I bought the jr. size bibs for my little one thinking it was a gimmick to have to buy bibs in different sizes.I think these particular bibs would've suited my guy in the beginning and that they are great up to a point.They are quite small when compared with the jr. bib but they do fit around the neck to ensure less crumbs and mess hit the t-shirt.The jr bib failed to do this b/c my guy was too small so I used to put a second infant bib underneath which avoided that issue.These bibs can fit 6 mos-2 yrs but I think they are becoming a little too small for my 16 month old in that he makes bigger messes with all the food he tries (my guy is not that big either, 24 lbs).I just rinse them after the meal and I set them aside to air dry, then reuse.They really are odor resistant (to a point) and the pockets work ok at preventing crumby messes.all in all, a great product!The only downside that I observed is that it can get moldy quickly if stored in a wet space (like in a plastic bag after placing it there- such as after dining out in a restaurant and forgetting to remove it that night)- but can be placed in a washing machine with some bleach quick enough.I love the way they look as much as I appreciate their functionality.Sometimes my little guy grabs the edge of the bib and holds it to his cheek while eating...why?I don't know, but he seems to like these bibs too.They are also wipeable, although I just throw them in the washing machine.I sometimes forget and throw them in the dryer as well, and they are great, they dont "melt" or anything like that.These are great, I would definitely recommend, and I will buy more of these!I am a mother with 3 young children and I wanted to know which bibs worked the best.I have compared the Bumkins Superbib, the Babybjorn bib, the Bibbity bib, and the Bumkins Sleeved bib.With my first child, I quickly realized that using cloth bibs and putting them in the laundry after each meal was a terrible idea.They would get moldy and I had to own a dozen bibs.Then I switched to Bumkins Superbibs.I just wash them in the sink after meals and hang them on my bib drying rack.The bibs are dry and ready to use again by the next meal.Bumkins Superbibs are lightweight and my babies never mind wearing them.Since the pockets are soft, they don't work well if the bib has been kept flat in a drawer.I always kept my Superbibs hanging upside down by the pocket on the bib drying rack.Now my third child is 8 months old and is eating mushy baby food.Even with the Bumkins Superbibs, there are still always some oatmeal spills on his clothes.I rarely have to change his entire outfit after a meal, but I wondered if there was a better bib available.Here are my results.Both the BabyBjorn and the Bibbity bibs are SMALLER than the Bumkins Superbibs.The Babybjorn bib is made of hard plastic (like a cup).It says "soft" in the description but that is just nonsense.The Bibbity bib is softer, like rubber.The Babybjorn bib is difficult to put on the baby because it is so hard.Even the neck strap is made of stiff plastic.I had great difficulty adjusting the neck hole because it kept hurting my son's neck.I never could get the hole small enough to keep food from escaping onto the clothes below his chin.Plan on baby crying the entire time you are fiddling with his bib.My son sits on a chair that clips onto the countertop.He really hated wearing this bib.The BabyBjorn bib is super easy to wash in the sink.It is easy to dry with a towel so you don't need a bib drying rack with this bib.The Bibbity bib is much better than the BabyBjorn bib.It is softer and feels like rubber.It was awkward to put on at first and my son was mad.I was able to get the neck hole small enough to keep most of the oatmeal out without hurting my son's neck.The Bibbity bib is about 1 inch shorter than the Bjorn bib and is 2.5 inches shorter than the Bumkins Superbib.The Bibbity bib is very easy to wash in the sink and dry with a towel.However, my 3 year old daughter refused to wear the Bibbity bib, and said it hurt her neck.She loves to wear her Bumkins Superbibs.UPDATE.My son is now 13 months old and refuses to wear the Bibbity bib.He still doesn't mind wearing the Bumkins SuperBibs.Unfortunately, all 3 of these bibs left way too much food spilled on my 8 month old's clothes.If you have a baby who eats mushy baby food and grabs the spoon, a regular bib just doesn't give adequate protection.It covered everything, even his lap!He could feed himself oatmeal and his clothes were very clean afterward!The sleeved bib is very easy to clean too.I just wash it off in the kitchen sink and hang it on my bib drying rack (which sits next to my kitchen sink).The sleeved bib went from dripping wet to completely dry in 2 hours.Since, the bib dries fast, I use the same sleeved bib at each meal.I don't recommend the Babybjorn bib.Sorry, Babybjorn.I LOVE to wear my baby in your carrier:)UPDATE: My son is now 13 months old.He refuses to wear the Bibbity bib at all.He also pull off the Bumkins Superbibs, throws them on the floor, and laughs.We now use the Bumkins sleeved bib at most meals which does the best job of protecting his clothes anyway.I wash it after each meal, hang it on the bib drying rack, and it is dry in 2 hours.I do still use the regular Bumkins Superbibs but I have to put them on with a big safety pin so he doesn't pull them off.I hang dry mine to ensure they last longer, and they dry very quickly, but I'm sure you can still throw them in the dryer.My son likes to pull his bibs off, so we thought we had to stick with the fabric snap-on ones, but for some reason, he can't easily pull these off.The designs are fun, the bibs are lightweight and easy to wear, and very simple to rinse in the sink.It's nice to have 3 so you always have a dry one handy.Maybe these are great for older babies who don't drool or spit their water or juice back out?Whenever my baby spits her drink back out, it dribbles underneath her chin and falls onto the top of the bib which then slides right down the back of the bib because these are not water-absorbant.I like the green sprouts water-absorbant bibs 100 times better than these ones!She always ends up wet after I use the bumkin bibs.But over time, they started to get a little.... gross...  We'd always have them hanging over the water faucet spout to dry out (which is kindof a pain b/c they're always in the way) but even doing that they still got mildew spots on them!Overall here's my analysis of using these bibs long-term:POSITIVE: They do have a pouch to catch food, and it is even water-proof!NEGATIVE: The pouch is not self-supported to stay propped out, so the food may just slide by if the pouch isn't magically held out at all timesPOSITIVE: You can wash them w/ your other laundryNEGATIVE: I'd always forget to grab them when I was doing the right loadPOSITIVE: They are better than most bibs out thereNEGATIVE: After continued use, even if you regularly wash and air them out, they will smell STINKY!!And they'll have mildew spots on them.My recommendation: Buy Baby Bjorn!!!!!!!!!!!!!BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Soft Bib - YellowHere's why:Unlike Bumkins, Baby Bjorn will NOT STINK over time, will NOT MILDEW, and is even EASIER to keep clean!A simple rinse in the sink is usually fine, but you can also throw them in the dish washer- you can't get much easier than that.Coming from a mom of a messy toddler, that makes a big difference!Now ditch the Bumpkins and buy a Baby Bjorn, ya hear???They clean up easy, air dry quickly, and protect his clothes against food and drinks.They take up about as much room in the diaper bag as a kleenex, have generous velcro fastener that allows for some of the thinest and chunkiest necks, and after nearly three years of constant use, I've yet to have any wear or tear on them.They may be a little pricier than some cheap drooler bibs at the store, but they are WELL worth the investment.I was hesitant to buy this due to the price, but loved how they looked so thought I would take a chance - glad I decided to buy.These are some of the best links I've found and we use them all of the time to link things together or to link toys to his stroller/car seat.This product has been perfect for my six month old.He has his bottom two teeth and loves to chew on things.He chews on it for awhile and I can make the rest of the family dinner!I love this item...when my husband first brought this home i didnt think i would use it..but when i did i loved it..i mainly put mangoes, watermelon and papaya in this thing and both my boys enjoy sucking the juices from it..they do make a mess but this way they are able to feed themselves...highly recommend this product!we got this as an introduction to fruits for our 18 month old but he doesen't like it hes weird out about it and rather eat the fruits alone then use this ....it was pointless to buy it because hes never wanted to use it totally afraid of it.He simply just wanted to eat the banana.LOL  This concept is great, but if you have a picky eater than this will not work.Go ahead and try this product because your baby might like it!My rating is based on the concept not usage.The handle is much easier for my 6 month old to hold and manipulate than the other feeders I bought.The only problem is that the mesh part does not come out of the plastic part to be washed.The nuk feeders are easier to clean, but much messier because my baby can't seem to hold on to it for very long.Baby cannot unsnap the lid so there's no accidental openings; the bags are slick therefore easier to clean; the round handle is perfect size for baby's grasp.Cute as well, can't miss!We slip a sippy cup holder through the handle and anchor it to baby's stroller, bouncer or highchair, etc, so it doesn't get tossed to the floor or ground!The first time I used it I put fresh peaches in it, he went nuts!He was a hot mess afterwards, as was his seat, but he was so happy munching on this.What a great idea!I liked this product although I did find it somewhat of a pain to clean after putting someting like avocado or banana in it.This is by far the worst feeder bag on the market.It is impossible to clean, unlike the brands where the bag can be removed.Try the Kid Co. Baby Steps.The bags can be removed for thorough cleaning which means you can buy new ones if they start to look worn.She gets very upset if you take it away from her too!I love this product and wouldn't want to be without it!Has been a sinch to clean.To me it sounds like banana is a bad idea so just stay away from that, wash it right away, and you should be fine!Great idea for a teething baby.takes some time to disinfect due to mesh bag but over all i would recommend to others.We have both the Munchkin version of this product and another version that's teal and white colored, made by Sassy(?).It makes loading and cleaning easier, and I also like that the other ones have removable and replacable mesh bags.Less plastic waste.Where were these with my other 4 kids?I love this product and so does my 7 month old (purchased them when she was 6 months).Apples are her favorite, but we have also done melon, bananas and carrots.I freeze my bananas first and then put them in the mesh.Before they turn to mushy is when I take them away from her.The only things we tried it with were avacado, strawberries and banana.It was impossible to get clean.I mean impossible.I loved the idea of being able to give him fresh fruits and veggies but honestly I found that mashing things up and feeding them to him with a spoon to be much easier.my daughter hates these and wanted nothing to do with them!they are not easy to clean either and your options are pretty limited as to what you can put in them.bananas are pretty much the only thing that makes sense to put in these feeders.i don't blame her.It gets pretty messy but I expect it being he's feeding himself.I would reccomend cleaning right after it's used.They are also hard to open.My daughter even starts looking around when she hears us getting ice from the fridge.:) I wouldn't use them for actual food though - kind of icky.I love the idea of this.The holes are small (by design obviously) but very little food actually gets out without really working at it.I'm going to try these again with our next baby to see if maybe my son just didn't like this because I really like the concept.But I've also tried breast milk, pears, cantaloupe.These are a brilliant concept but a poor execution.I bought these for my teething 5 month old, and threw in some banana pieces.Bad idea.These things are impossible to clean, food gets stuck everywhere.Another brand recommended cleaning with warm water, vinegar, and alka seltzer, so I'll be trying that- but in the meantime, will NOT be putting fresh fruit in these.That being said, I do make and freeze my own baby food, and a cube of that is messy but provides neater cleanup of the product, so it's not a total loss.Will I buy these for my next baby?God no.I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old isn't thrilled about using this.The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold.My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her.I don't like the little snap clip that you have to squeeze in order to open this thing -- it's very difficult to open.I like the design of that one better but this one is more durable and easier to clean if you manage to wash this right away.This thing rocks!!My little man wouldn't stay in the bob for too long before, now he looooves it!I would buy it again if needed.She uses it after every meal in her high chair and its so cute to watch her try to imitate me when I brush my teeth.My 14 month old daughter has been using this toothbrush for a few months now.This is the one toothbrush that she actually enjoys brushing with.I purchased five different infant toothbrushes and this is my favorite.It's just wide enough that baby can't put the whole thing in his/her mouth so they can't try to swallow it or gag on it.This gets all the top and bottom teeth.You may want to buy a few because they are easy to loose but trust me, It's the best!So, if you just buy this you'll save all the money I spent buying every toothbrush that was inferior.I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger.The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all.Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway.It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket.We weren't that impressed.Yes, the sheep is cute and it appears to be well made.However, the sound effects were lacking.It creeped me out.Now we just play a rain sound track on the ipod we put in his room.Plus, no batteries are required for the ipod.And I don't know why we would ever get the smaller travel version.Very cute, soft & cuddly2.They actually include the batteries!The first baby toy I've purchased that wasn't too cheap to make you buy your own batteries.My daughter is four months old at the time of this review and she definitely has wide eyes for this soother, she still sleeps in our bedroom and I think the sound feature will not only help lull her to sleep but also keep her from being disturbed when we go to bed after her.This is such a sweet little lamb that makes soothing sounds to comfort infants.My wife and I got this as a gift for our second child.We really like this a lot, especially if you believe in white noise helping a baby sleep.We live in a noisy environment (daytime hours), so this is helpful in putting the baby down for a nap.Besides the softness and cute design of a sheep, it is designed well because it is easy to 'install' on a crib or play-yard.Our daughter loves this toy and we do too.The music plays over 30 minutes and you can adjust the volume and select from different sounds like waves and jungle sounds.We regret buying an expensive and useless mobile because the music plays for only a few minutes to keep your baby happy, then as soon as it stops she is upset and you have to either listen to her cry or go back in and turn it on again.Whereas we could put this toy next to her crib and she could listen to it while she fell asleep.Now that she is over 2, she sleeps with it in her big girl bed.They are still developing their vision and are too young to play with toys.Now that she is three months old our use of it has tapered off a bit, but I bet when she gets big enough to hold dolls it will definitely be put back in heavy rotation.The fleece is soft, the ivory color is pretty and neutral, and I found the velcro especially helpful.We had a very sparse and bare crib for safety, and velcroing the sleep sheep out of reach on the top of the bars, but still in view of baby, softened up an otherwise barren crib without any of the dangers associated with SIDS.The volume is easily controllable and the batteries last forever.Because it was one of her earliest toys, we have such fond memories of sleep sheep.I'm buying the third one the newest addition to the family.I'm a strong believer in environmental sounds as a aid to restful sleep and even purchased the Ecotones Duet Sleep Sound machine for considerably more than this toy.The Sleep Sheep is a great product, except for a huge design flaw.The buttons to turn the music on and off are on the back, which makes it difficult to reach them because the animal is meant to be strapped to a surface such as a crib or swing.If you are interested in this product, I highly recommend you buy the on-the-go version to save yourself a great deal of frustration.It still helps my 8 month old daughter get to sleep at night.She definitely falls asleep and stays asleep much better with it on.It helps her go right back to sleep without a problem when I lay her back down in her crib.We have been using the Sleep Sheep since my daughter was born and came home from the hospital as a preemie.I highly recommend this product to new parents.White noise is wonderful thing when you have a fussy baby who doesn't sleep well.However, it only plays for 45 mins (SO ANNOYING).Also, you're not supposed to put anything plush in baby's crib for the first year, technically, so really this is just a white noise machine that hangs on the exterior of our crib.I wish I had taken the 20 bucks and spent it on a nice white noise machine that would play all night and block out family noise for my son.From birth to year one, you probably DON'T need a physical object making noise for your baby since you aren't supposed to put anything in the crib.That said, I hang sleep sheep from the side of the co-sleeper, set it to 45 mins and hit the 'rain' option.I don't mind at all the timing out of the sound.I like the idea that it helps baby fall asleep without creating an unneeded, night-long dependency.Some babies 100% absolutely need the constant sound (get an MP3 player and docking station, download MP3 white noise of your choice and hit 'loop'), but if your baby does not then the timing out options are great.I was also given a white noise bear by Carter's, but I simply pulled the sound box from it and 'attached' it the car seat so we have 'rain' for the road...ironic since I live in Seattle.Overall, white noise of any kind I recommend, but if you like the cuteness of Sleep Sheep it's worth the buy.Would be nice if FUTURE versions were MP3 compatible OR if they offered MP3 compatible inserts.That'd be handy as baby grows and you want OTHER types of night time music in a secure and cuddly location.The sleep sheep is sooo soft and cute.It's not a miracle but it puts my back to sleep in the middle of the night when she wakes up and I like having it as part of our nap/nightly routine.There is a travel version but I'm not sure I need that since it's really just the size of a stuffed animal which I take with me when my baby has to go to sleep somewhere else.I noticed a lot of people don't like that it doesn't stay on continuously but that isn't a concern for me as she doesn't wake up when it times out.Horribly crappy product!I don't know what all the hype is about cloudb products and I'm disappointed I bought into it!I expected a quality gund-like stuffed animal.Nope!Such a CHEAP stuffed animal.The soundmaker is supposed to fit in a hole in its back - but it doesn't fit at all!It's not meant for cribs, so where or why would you use it???Absolute waste of money, I will be returning it!It has different sounds to choose.It plays for 45 min which is so much better than the 5 min "prince lionheart bear" we bought.We had a dinner party last night and the sleep sheep really helped baby to tune out the noisy grownups.I find it pretty soothing too... and it was the first toy that he batted at at 3 months of age!It puts him to sleep almost instantly.He slept the same with or without it.We used it at every nap, and many bedtimes.However, after 4 months of solid use, the sound device kicked out.Wouldn't make any sound but static.It was very annoying.However, when I emailed the company who makes the Sheep, they agreed to send me a new noisemaker without any hassles.So, overall, 4 stars for concept, 3 stars for execution, but 5 stars for customer service.Sure, slow would be soothing, but this is abnormally slow.-The "whale songs" are creepy.They sound nothing like what I would think whale songs would sound like.It just sounds like muffled moans.Weird.Wishes:-I wish it had more time options.Both times seems too long.They help the baby get to sleep, then continue into their sleep cycle before abruptly turning off.-I wish they made a sleep sheep that plugged into the wall that could sit on a nightstand or something that could play white noise continuously.I'd like a few things different, but it works in helping my son go to sleep.We use it on the "waves" setting and it is very soothing.The Sleep Sheep makes soothing sounds, although surprisingly does not offer the generic White Noise sound which a lot of infants seem to like.I emailed CloudB about it, and literally within TWO MINUTES, I got a response that said they were sending me a new sound box immediately.Customer Service doesn't get any better than that!We started using the sleep sheep when our daughter was in her bassinet in our room.From the very beginning it was even soothing for us to go to sleep.Fabulous sleep aide!We have used this sleep sheep during nap time and bed time for almost a year now for our baby.The background noise is really soothing for him.The sound is a bit garbled but it is still a great solution.There's a velcro strap on the back so it can hang on the side of the crib.I put this by the bassinet when I put my baby down for naps or for the night and it's awesome.I woudl recommend this to anyone with an infant.It's a real lifesaver.I bring it in the car, I put it near his baby chair, it goes in the bed... its everywhere!Nursing is hard enough without having to do it blind.The fabric is beautiful and light enough that baby and I aren't sweltering under it, and I have used it as a makeshift blanket or sun shade to cover him and it has worked very well.There are two terrycloth pockets on the inside bottom corners, and these have come in handy for wiping milk or drool off of baby and myself.I'm currently pregnant, but I bought this for a coworker who is also pregnant.Now I'm jealous and want one too.It has full coverage, and we both love the burp-cloth type material on the corners.It allows for privacy while also allowing the mother to still see the breast feeding baby.I love this cover!We can see eachother and he doesn't get too hot!One of my favorite baby products!This cover is breathable, pretty design, and covers well.I got several compliments on this cover.This cover makes nursing in public discreet.I also put my cover over the peek-a-boo window of my combo stroller when my infant was sleeping to keep the light out.Unfortunately, my 100 pound dog decided to get my nursing cover off my table and chewed up the neck strap making it impossible to use.I will be buying this same cover & design in the near future for our next baby on the way.Very nice product & worth the money!I LOVE this cover!Very high quality fabric that is heavy and big enough to keep squirming baby covered, yet light enough to not make us both hot.Great product, works great, my wife loves it.The only reason I gave it a 3 star out of 5 is because of the price.Your paying for the name I guess.It is however the best of its kind in the market.My mom said she could of made one herself, which I believe she could of done.Anyways, great product, horrible value.I also like how the corners are weighted slightly so that the baby doesn't just flip the side open (thus defeating the purpose of a cover).It is also large enough to fully cover everything eliminating any need to feel self conscious etc as with other smaller covers.I would recommend this cover to any nursing mothers or for anyone who soon will be one!I really like having this to cover up while feeding my daughter.I attend a church with more nursing moms than I have ever seen under one roof so we all compair our products and I have to admit, Baby Au Lait make the most impressive nursing cover I have yet to see.The hoop at the top allows me to see my baby to make sure that she isn't having a difficult time latching on.If I knew how to sew, this would be a great project for new moms as they are pretty simple and very handy.I have received three nursing covers.The Bebe Au Lait is of higher quality and easier to use.However, I still have difficulty with it.I believe the trouble stems from having a larger chest (F/G cup size), which means that when my little boy nurses, he is fairly low -- unless he is supported by a pillow and my breast by a towel or burp clothes or my hand.The material creases and folds inwards between the stiff rim and my son's head; therefore, I can no longer see him.When using it in more public locations, I have had to latch him on with the cover tossed to the side (along with modesty), then covering up.Based on the pictures, it seems that I have to hold my son lower than the women modeling the cover hold their baby.I will continue practicing with the cover; I think eventually I will find the right way to position myself, the baby and the cover so that I can remain covered and comfortable... and if not, it still is my preferred option for nursing in public.My daughter, currently 2.5 months old, flat out refuses to latch if she cannot see my face.This has made privacy difficult, as the nursing cover I used with her brother doesn't allow her to see me easily without exposing more than I'd like, or having to use one hand to hold the necklime out so she can see me.I found a Bebe au Lait cover (different pattern) at my local lactation consultant's office, and I LOVE it.The wire or plastic or whatever it is in the neckline allows the neck to bow out from my chest, so that I can see her (and make sure she's latching well) and she can look up at any time to see Mommy, so she nurses happily, even when covered.The neck still sticks out after repeatedly folding the cover up and toting it around in the diaper bag.I love it, and will never buy another brand of cover!I will start out by saying that I usually HATE using nursing covers but I do use this one when I nurse in very public places.My best friend gave me the BeBe Au Lait nursing cover after my son was born and I had already started breastfeeding him.I had such a hard time getting him to latch in the beginning and he was very squirmy.With the Bebe Au Lait, it straps around your neck so that it won't fall down in front but you can still peek through the opening that the plastic boning provides to view latching and see how well your baby is eating.The fabric is also much wider than I expected, so when the baby kicks or bats an arm, it doesn't totally expose you either.I love this thing!!!I am a PROUD breastfeeder but didn't want to expose myself and this gave me the confidence to get out of the car and fitting rooms I had been hiding in before.Never with anything else would I have had the nerve to nurse my son in public, let alone even sitting at the table in a busy restaurant (which I did, more than once) with such CONFIDENCE!Makes a great cover for pumping too!When I returned to work, I ended up pumping in a storage closet without a lock on the door.(Yay.)I brought my Bebe Au Lait with me and used it to cover in case anyone walked in, which actually happened once.It was great to have something to cover me and to be able to see how much milk I was pumping but that I could still look down and make sure I was attaching/removing the flanges properly.I also used the cover a few times over the infant car seat for sun shade or protection from the rain.I happen to have two of these now because I found one at a consignment store.Now I am expecting baby # 2 and I am so happy that I have my Bebe Au Lait from the start!This thing will be ESPECIALLY nice to have in the hospital when friends, family, and nurses pop in without any announcement!*update** 7/19/12** I love both of my BeBe Au Lait nursing covers.You can't see a thing.Even in hot Florida sun at Disneyworld it is lightweight and doesn't make me or baby sweat too badly.Until then, the extent of my nursing in "public" consisted of either the ladies' lounge at Nordstrom, the car in random parking lots, or (twice, in a pinch), a handicapped stall in a bathroom.I'm a VERY private person, but I made my husband check out whether this was full coverage, and he promised it was totally covering everything that I didn't want out on display (including my tummy/back where I pulled up my shirt).It's much better than just using a blanket, since it can't be pulled or fall off your shoulder.Also, the boning really does work--you can see your baby easily, and you can see to put your clothes back together when you are finished.As an added bonus, it was fantastic to get my baby to sleep on the plane, it blocked out all the lights and stimulation so she could get a nap.I have overall been very happy with this product until lately.I have used it many times as a lightweight "sun cover" for his carseat as well and a burp cloth if I don't have anything else around since it has a small, thick terry cloth patch (with a pocket I've never used).Because it doesn't cover all the way around, just the front area, it is sometimes difficult for me to stay covered when my son is less sleepy and more active.The amount of use I've gotten out of this cover justifies the money spent and I'll continue to use this even with our squirmy guy.I would buy this again.I'm glad I purchased this nursing cover.I've used it several times in public, and it works very well.It covers me, and that's what it's supposed to do.That's my only problem, and it could just be me.I do wish it were a little bigger.I ordered the Mint Chocolate design, and it looks great.it performed well and covered her appropriately in style during feeds.restaurants.Although if you're at a restaurant and the waiter is standing over you they can also see your baby along with other things.It looses a star for me because the material is not very breathable and baby and I both get hot using it at times in Cali weather.I put this product on baby registry because the ability to see my baby while nursing seemed very attractive.This was one of the most expensive privacy blankets on the market.I am disappointed that it is not very easy to use, especially with a baby who does not latch on too well and is fussy.If your baby goes to the breast easily, this may not be a problem, but so far, I have been unable to use it.It is so fashionable that people usually think it's a shawl and I'm just cold when I'm really pumping.I've washed them about 80 times already and they feel like new.The bibs are soft and absorbent.Good value and wash well, but, because there is no lining, they soak through easily and clothes can be soiled.These bibs are fantastic because the Velcro closure stays flat so it won't irritate my baby's neck.They are a bit thin but still absorbs well.2nd favorite bibs only second to Frenchie.Not for newborns at 2 months she can wear them well.We purchased these for our 3 month old.It's a great utilitarian purchase because we find we need a new bib after every feeding.However, our baby's spit up quickly gets absorbed through to reach his clothing and allow it to get wet as well.This to us is an issue; it would be better if it had a liner.Very well made and easy to navigate - runs well on carpets w/o thick padding, too!Nice rounded handlebar instead of "two sticks" so baby is unlikely to hurt itself.Well made and very cute.The boy is taller than the girl, so his feet almost reach the floor, but he hasn't figured out how to make it go when he is riding on it.They both enjoy sitting on them, but they have the most fun pushing them around.Bumper cars, anyone?The girl had fun recently putting a stuffed animal on one and then pushing it around.It will be interesting to see what they use them for in the coming months, as well as watching them learn to make them go while riding on them.These are so cute.ETA:  My biggest concern when purchasing this was which size to buy.I went with the larger and am glad I did.As mentioned above, at 14 months, their feet didn't reach the floor enough for them to propel themselves, but they still enjoyed them.Their 3 1/2 year old cousin was on them recently and he didn't look too big for them.The only problem with them is when the twins use them as a step stool, but that isn't a flaw in the product!My husband is the oldest child and the oldest cousin, so we end up doing a lot of housesitting/babysitting and visiting family.I searched and found this.I was a little nervous about the mixed reviews on here, but overall I figured you get what you pay for.We had no problems transporting this or setting it up (slip it out of the bag, pull it open.")However, I made the mistake of not putting this away when my little boy wasn't sleeping on it.So one side is now taller than the other, but still off the ground.It looks a little funny, but still functions.I would just suggest putting it away and only using it for sleeping.I do think the idea of a crib mattress pad and crib sheet is a good one.It does seem to get pretty cold, especially when you are sleeping on a real bed and the poor little kid is sleeping on a fabric one.Plus then you don't have to worry about any nighttime accidents, since the sheet it comes with (and the cot cover) are spot clean only.The reason for 4 out of 5 stars.Overall happy customer that would recommend to friends.While trying to decide what kind of portable bed to get my almost 3 year old daughter, I was looking at a few different things.The toddler air mattresses with raised sides, the pea pod plus, and cots like this one.I was concerned about the weight of the air mattress when deflated.And then I found this cot.At 1/4 of the price of the others and how quick and easy it is to set up (2 seconds, not joking), I gave it a try and I'm SO glad I did!Like I said, it's super easy to set up.Ready for sleep!It comes with a sheet which is nice, but I only used it once.My daughter does tend to get colder while sleeping on this.I put on a crib mattress pad and a flanel crib sheet and this seems to have taken are of that problem.Bonus - even with the crib mattress pad and crib sheet, it will fold up and fit in its carry bag no problem!!The support strap in the middle underneath hasn't given my daughter any problems yet and even if it does later, then I guess it will be time for a different type of travel bed.!My daughter calls it her "blue bed" and constantly asks to sleep on it even while at home.My nieces have all loved sitting on it to watch tv or play and their ages are 2, 4, and 7.As someone who frequently travels with my daughter by myself, it is so much easier with this cot!!!The pack n play was just too heavy and took up too much room.This will actually fit in a large suitcase!Also, on the box, the weight says up to 75 pounds.This has the look and feel as the more expensive security blanket brand My Blankee.My baby loves to snuggle with it.Be advised though, that one sided is full satin.I got these because I didn't like the idea of choosing between whether my son would chew on plastic or wood and finish.This play yard is really better than I expected for the price.Only problem we had with it was closing it back up after opening it.There is a hidden hinge that we could not find to get it to fold flat.I got this playpen in the multi, because at the time it was the cheapest, and I really didn't care.taller and 3 in.longer than my Graco pack and play.The solid ends allow me to sit in the same room, but out of sight, which lets my daughter play by herself longer.I gave it 5 stars, because I have yet to find any flaws with it.Granted, it isn't as elegant?So far, it is sturdy, sets up quickly and easily, and I like that it comes with a storage bag, which as yet I haven't tried, but since that is what it came in, I know that it fits.The pocket on one end is a good place to store the bag.I have been very satisfied with this purchase, and I would buy it again.Oh, and the picture shows it having the ends taller and curved, but they aren't, all 4 sides are the same height.Update:I have used the storage bag twice, and it is very easy to get in the bag, and the handles make it easy to carry-I'm liking it better than my Pack and Play!Ball can roll, but only if an adult does it a certain way.My 7 mo old likes the toy, it catches his eye due to the mirrors while rolling and he teeths on it for a bit.I thought it would give you ideas of how to paint or what to paint but it is just the paint itself and a sponge, which is a little overpriced for what it is.Great concept and it turned out really well, just wonder if i could have bought some non toxic paint at the local store for 10% of the cost.We got them a week ago and they are cool.My girl is  6 months and likes them.They have many thinks to grab them by and are colorful.First I was a little skeptic because of the price but you end up having 4 separate toys that stay around in different places at $6 each, not bad:) They are great to attach to stroller or playmat or crib, they come with two chain linksthey are HUGE - almost 4 inchesthey are machine washable and you can humble them dry.This toy is cute.Definitely worth the price, especially as it helps soothes the little one to sleep for car rides.Another good Taggie product.My baby loves this toy.This is a very cute and interesting toy.This toy offers many many many places for little fingers to grab onto and it makes a melodic jingle when shaken like a rattle.Not that Valco's are cheap; they're pricey too.That being said, I saw this in Buy Buy Baby (Bed, Bath & Beyond's answer to Babies R Us).It was a couple dollars cheaper, and with my 20% off coupon, it was even less.The best thing is this is a universal mount.She hates to have her face covered, and if she cannot look up and see my face, she just won't nurse.I had no idea what to do, but I was given a beautiful cover from another brand as a gift and suddenly my problem was solved, and now I can nurse in public without any problems (and with both hands free).I would keep looking - there are better covers out there.The only downside is the quality.When I received it, I washed the bristles in luke warm water and mild soap and dried it, bristle side down, overnight.The next day, I found the wood warped and cracked in two places.I had to return it and didn't bother to exchange it because I figured they would all do that.If I don't find another brand that I like just as much as this one, I'll buy another and try again.I love the look and feel of this product.Enjoy!He loves to spin the beads and the abcs.A type of toy that is very versatile with age.I also love that I bought mine on super clearance at Target for $[...].My six month old grandson loves his Busy Zoo Activity Center, but I am very disappointed in the finishing techniques used during the manufacturing process.I would have expected a toy that was this expensive to have been made more carefully.Wood can cut as seriously as a knife blade, so it seems that the manufacturer should have rounded the edges or smoothed them more carefully.The beads which are on the top of the Center are finished inconsistently; some are very shiney, and others have a matte finish and uneven color.The differing finishes are mixed on the three wires atop the Center, so it does not appear this was a conscious decision on the manufacturer's part.Further, most of the beads are nicely rounded, but there are several that are shaped more like olives - again, I do not believe this was a conscious decision.The animal decals on the mixed-up and match the parts side are already bubbling off; the tops and bottoms of these wood pieces are somewhat rough.However, as they are end-grain wood, it may not be possible to smooth them as well as one can do with the straight-grain side.One of the more serious problems I saw with this Center was on the side which had three serpentine pathes for different circles to descend.The manufacturer used plywood on this side and it is splintering off on two of the serpentine paths.Further, the paint on these paths is chipping away where the plywood has splintered off.My last observation has to do with the spinning alphabet side of the Center.Each letter has a picture with the name of the object under it.Many are unusual animals, not frequently associated with teaching the alphabet to a child.ukulele, in place of the mythical one.While this could be a wonderful toy for a toddler, I would definitely recommend being very picky about the finish before accepting final delivery on this expensive product.We had to send the first one back because it had been damaged and someone did a lousy job of repainting the damaged area.The second one has lots of little flaws - poorly painted in areas, painted over tape, crooked parts.Overall, I do like it, but I wish it was better made.First, let me say that there are a LOT of reviewers bashing this toy for things that have occurred to their infants while playing with it.Those are through no fault of the toy, that is the fault of the parent for introducing it too early.This toy is rated for 12+, not 9 months, not 10 months, but 12+ months.There is a reason why toys have age ratings, for the safety and development of your child.She pulled it over and it fell on her.Once she was 12 mo she was better able to use it without having to use it for full support.I think that this the difference.I won't repeat myself.Thirdly, there are a lot of reviewers stating that the toy is poorly made.We have this toy and it is NOTHING like described by those reviewers.My advice to them is to contact the company and have it replaced.When I was looking for a retractable gate, this was the first one I found.I looked around for a while and have come to find that all retractable gates have generally the same problems!They are difficult to retract for some, others have springs that break, most are difficult to install, etcI opted to go with the Kiddy Guard because of a video review that I found on Amazon.We installed it about a month ago.Things I've read that made me question whether to buy this gate:*Is it one hand operation?Yes and no - if you need to operate it one handed, there is a loud clicking noise.The manufacture says this is to warn adults if an older child is opening the gate (right).*Is it loud?When opening the gate one handed, the clicking noise it makes while retracting is quite loud.Other reviews claimed this noise scares their children.After a moment of thought, I realized that if she is going to be scared of something - the area around the stairs is probably a good place to fear!However, as with most things, after about the 5th time, she doesn't mind it any more.Some reviews claim the noise is loud enough to wake a baby - usually if my baby is sleeping, I have two hands to operate the gate.*Is installation difficult?I would imagine any retractable gate would have similar difficulties.Installation does require two people (I should say, two adults).One of the biggest issues my husband and I faced was timing - we couldn't install it while our daughter was roaming, so it had to wait until night, when we were both tired (and a little cranky).I bought 2 wall mount kits (one for each side) but we only needed one, since we have baseboard (the wall mount kit contains 2 brackets).The other issue - the wall kit includes toggle bolts which require a 1/2" hole to be drilled.We started to install, then had to go buy a drill bit big enough to accommodate.*Is the lock difficult to operate?That being said - I'm often lazy, and at 5'9", I am tall enough to step over the gate without any trouble.*Is it hard to latch both top and bottom hooks?Some times.It can be frustrating when you catch one hook but not the other, then you have to re-set the locking mechanism and try again.I don't feel like it's that big of a deal.I love that It is out of the way when my baby is sleeping & I love that there are no little holes or braces for her to pull up or climb on.Is it perfect?Not by any means.Would I recommend it?If you've had to give a baby a bath you know how hard it is on your knees.This product makes that task way easier on you.And as a benefit it has pockets for things that might come handy during bath time.It folds up and hangs on the side of the tub for convenient storage.This is a must for baby bath time.Not sure about over time as I have read feedback stating that it smells after months of use, but right now it's a back and knee saver!Comfy but doesn't stay in place.It stains and smells sour after seven months and washing it doesn't solve the problem.I let it air dry after every use but the odor is permanent.I never had any otehr thermometer, so I'm still questioning spending $15 on such a stupid small thing :))) But it works great.Very convenient.It's beeping when the water gets too cold or too hot.It beeps every time the temp changes.It's cute, it's a good size, and the baby likes it.I used to use a thermometer that measures steam milk temp to measure baby's bath water.Got too irritating so I found this little gadget.The battery is installed out of the box, you simply put it in water and it starts showing you the temp of the water.I try to keep it at 95-97 range since it's the middle ground.I guess that was the intention of it for being a toy thermometer.This little tool is a must have when preparing for your little one's bath.It is easy to use - just put it in the water and you will get a real time read on the temperature both in Celsius and Fahrenheit.It will beep when it is out of range of an acceptable temperature.Highly recommend - it self drains and is a great tool to have when bathing your little one!It's very difficult to sometimes judge bath water temperature.If your hands are cold, the water will feel too hot: likewise, if you've just come from a hot shower, you may think the bath water too cold.Having an objective reading staring at you from this floating turtle is great insurance, and reassurance, that you will not scold or chill your baby- esp.As a second benefit, kids love playing with water toys, so it serves two useful purposes.One small problem is that that electrodes can get corroded over time, esp.if hard water is used.This may take a whole year or more to happen, but the electodes can be cleaned with sand paper or vinegar, or easier yet, by the time a year has passed, you likely don't need the help of a thermometer any longer.Also can be used as a toy when they are older in the tub.Being a new mom I wasn't sure about bath temprature for my baby.It will also beep if the water is too cold.The only annoying this about Trever is that when you take it out of the water when done bathing it will beep and beep until all of the water is out of it's shell.The way to fix the annoying beeping is to shake the water out of it.We use Trever everytime it's bath time at my house.As a first time mom I obsessed over everything, including bath safety for baby.The only downside is that it would drive me a little crazy when the water would get a bit too hot because it would take forever to shut up while I added cold water (of course, baby was not in the bathtub while I adjusted the water temperature).I'd assume this would be the ONLY thing that the manufacturer should have figured out - how to use a bath thermometer in the bathtub without destroying it.Anyway, instead of gadgets, save your money and just stick your elbow in the bathtub.We've had this about 6 months, and for that 6 months, it worked great!!It may be that the battery needs replacing, but I feel it should have a longer life initially.The product itself works great and I love that I can check the temperature for my son's bath.Also, the piece that the head snaps onto is not good for my son to be putting in his mouth as it's small as well and could break off.We have only used this in the bath and he rarely even plays with this, so it should have lasted longer than this.I'm very disappointed with this as otherwise it works great.When I see it drop below a desired temperature, I immediately know to add more warm water.It either thinks it's too cold or too hot.Then when I take it out of the water, it won't stop beeping.I shake it off repeatedly and then it turns off.Then turns on when it feels like it and beeps again!Eventually I just got so frustrated with it, I threw it out.Waste of money.I bought this as a first time mom because I was worried about everything.I'm really glad I bought this.It's cute and easy to use.After all, it just floats around, displays the temperature, and beeps if it gets too hot or too cold.You will definitely hear the beeping too.It's not insanely loud or anything, but it won't be missed.My daughter is a toddler now and still likes to play with her turtle so it is a good toy as well.What a great idea!I was using my son's thermometer to test the water but I like this better.The temp beeps if it's too hot.My son loves to play with it, and if he sees it sitting along the side of the tub he gets real excited until we give it to him.I will definitely be using this for a long time.Previously I had one of those infant tubs with a built in thermometer.When the thermometer in the infant tub got wet, it broke (useful, huh?).Pros:Waterproof (Up to 1 Meter)Easy to use (Simply put into the water -- turns on itself)Alarms (Beeps if water is too hot or cold)AttractiveNo sharp edges or small partsBattery is easy to replace (Make sure the unit is dry first!It doesn't bother me, but it may bother some people.Both units are specified on the LCD.Highly suggested!Now, I don't have to worry about the water being too cold or hot for my baby.It tracks the water temperature the entire time and she plays with it too.It turns off by itself after a few shakes to get the water off it.I got this product when my son was just born.I absoultely loved knowing what the bath temp was and if it was too hot or cold.The battery screw got stripped on my old one and I didn't think twice about going out and buying a new one.It also constantly monitors the temp and beeps when it gets too hot or cold.Love the product but broke within 7 months!Worked the first 6 months and made our life easy.I guess you only need the product to make sure the water's not too hot for your guy.Planned obselescence (sp?We know that the water temperature is good for him, know that it's the same as the last time he had bath.Recently he discovered this cute toy, so he is playing with it while bathing.The only problem I have with it is that often it wouldn't turn off automatically when I pull it out of water.It takes a fair amount of shaking and then waiting for a few minutes (as long as 10 once!)for it to turn off!If not for this complaint this thermometer turtle would've gotten 5 stars.UPDATE: about 7 months of regular use, now the thermometer stopped showing some of the digits, so it is pretty useless.It always collected quite a bt of water and had issues with turning itself off.Not sure if we got a lemon, or they are not good quality.We are getting a different product nowAs a first-time mom, I wasn't confident enough to make this judgment based on feeling the water with my hand.Also, I wanted my husband, who is the main bath-giver, to have a guideline, since he seems to be able to tolerate water at much higher temperatures than me.We went on vacation and I wanted to make sure she would be fine sleepng in a queen bed.This thing is a little awkward with its two tiers.You pretty much have to take off the top tier to reach whatever is in the bottom tier.You can set it up 2 different ways.One way drains the water so you can put it directly next to a sink and never worry about dealing with the drainage.I ended up returning it for something slightly smaller.I'm regretting that decision now.If you put bottles on this rack, they will eventually get dry... the key word here is "eventually".If you wash at night and need things to be dry in the morning, try something else.There just isn't enough air flow to get nipples, bottles, or breast pump accessories dry on the inside.We had no idea how bad it was until we tried another rack - the Boon Grass drying mat.It cut our evening washing time in half because we no longer needed to hand-dry everything we needed for the next morning.In general I Love this drying rack.I had bought 2 other drying racks before this.If you're using Dr Brown's bottles, you already know it is a 5 part bottle, 6 if you count the bottle cap, which I use on every bottle, to keep the nipple clean after I assemble them for use.Not to mention part # 7 the bottle cap which I also use!So you can imagine cleaning one bottle after use means I'm drying 7 parts!But I do wish there was a better organizational way of drying all the parts.Because it serves its purpose I rate it 4 stars... because it does not take into account all the parts I have to dry.I take one star away.This could have been a great product but it really is not.The bottom rack makes difficult to find anything.I don't see the purpose I put the bottles on the counter after sterilazion waste of money.Before I installed these covers, my little guy was constantly trying to get to the outlets, which were covered with those little clear plastic covers.He was obsessed with trying to get the covers off.But once I installed the Safety 1st covers, he stays away.He's not interested at all and just walks on by.The Safety 1st cover fits all of the outlets in my house, no problem.And I like the fact that it's kind-of difficult to remove the cover - makes me feel safer that my little guy could never get it off.I recently purchased this for my daughter's new nursing baby.We wanted to co-sleep with our baby, but knew would sometimes not want her in our bed.It is so easy to reach over to soothe her, talk to her, or pick her up and bring her into bed or vice versa.Love this mini-co sleeper!I spent days, hours looking for the "right" option for us for our first baby.We never did hook it up to my bed.And it's like 1/2 a step to get up and grab them from the mini sleeper to feed him.We have this set, as well as theNoJo Jungle Babies Wallpaper Borderand the hamper.When we are changing him, he is checking out the wallpaper border, and when he is in his crib, I see him looking and reaching out for the animals on the bumpers, or staring up at the mobile.I originally chose to buy this product based on the review where another reviewer wrote that her kid enjoyed looking at the animals.However, it makes a great tummy-time mat!The crib sheet isn't all that soft, but we use anBasic Comfort Ultimate Crib Sheetanyway.The mobile doesn't play for that long - it is more for looks than for function.Particularly because babies cannot see pastels until they are nearly past the age that you are supposed to have a mobile.There is no velcro strap that comes off - it is not furry either but just plain cotton.As LO got bigger, I felt that the support of the Boppy wasn't as good as it was sagging in the middle.I went ahead and bought the My Brest Friend Pillow and immediately like the many features - the pocket, the strap snap, the contours on the pillow to support the baby, and the back support which the Boppy pillow did not provide.The only negative I had was that the washing instructions were to only drip dry versus tumble dry on low.Overall, would highly recommend this product - makes breast feeding so much easier!Both my husband and I use this pillow for many things and I recommend this highly!Breast feeding: I find the support amazing and baby lays comfortably on there and he gets so relaxed he can nap on there and I can let him without my arms getting tired.Lets me move around while breastfeeding.Bottle-feeding:  As he gets heavier both my husband and I put this on to support him while we do so.It helps our arms not get so tired and baby has a stable place to sit down.Playing:  2 months old, he likes to lay down and just look at us and coo.He likes to lay there and just move around while he's on our lap.Napping:  Good place where I can let him take a nap on me while I'm doing something and don't want to put him down.Or I'm watching TV and he likes to sit there or lay there and nap.Love the back support.But I had to make more support underneath because it wasn't high enough for me.Of coarse, it depends on the hold you use with baby.I'm happy the cover can be washed.I like the one for baby's head, but not the one that sits under her butt.I tried using the boppy, but that pillow drops off near your body and the baby just falls into the crevasse.The brestfriend pillow is big, ugly, and has a stupid name, but it is a highly effective tool in supporting your baby while you nurse, and I am so glad that I have one!I like that it clips around you so that it doesn't shift around.I like that it offers back support.I like that it keeps your baby high and close to your body.It took the strain off of my neck, back, and wrist when I was learning to breast-feed.Honestly, nursing is awkward enough as it is when you're just getting started.After a couple weeks it got flatter and flatter as he got bigger.I started slouching to feed him and had horrible upper back pains and poor posture as a result.I decided to buy the Brest Friend and I am so glad I did!Yes, it's not cheap, but when it comes to your health $40 is not a lot to spend!!He would nurse for 1.5 hours at a time, every 3-4 hours.He basically lived on my boobs.Luckily, once he really got the hang of latching on (after the first week or two), I found that I could lay him on "My Brest Friend", wedge a small throw pillow under "My Brest Friend" to keep the baby at the right height (the strap holds the pillow roughly in the right place, but not quite well enough for 'freehanding' it), get the baby latched on, then use my hands to do all kind of things: Eat, use the computer, write thank-you cards, etc.If not for this pillow and the ability to multitask while marathon nursing, I can't imagine that I would have nursed him as long as I have.He's currently 7 months, and these days usually breastfeeds in only 10-15 minutes, but I still often place him on the pillow to nurse if I want to use those minutes to get a little work done on the computer or scarf down some food with two hands.Disadvantages:1. too short, needed another pillow in addition2.the back bar always hurt my back and you can't bf without it being buckled or it slips away.3.need two hands and I never had two hands when it was time to feed the baby!#1 and #2 meant that I rarely used it.Now I just got the boppy and it worked great!it's high enough, easy to put on and take off and I can do it with one hand!Wish I'd have gotten the boppy in the first place.This product seems great, but I recommend you buy it after your baby is born.My wife asked me to order this from Amazon during our third trimester in preparation for the delivery.However, if you end up with a c-section or other surgical intervention during your delivery, she has found this product is not easy to use because of the pressure it puts on your abdomen.The pain is there for about a month or sometimes slightly longer.By time she was able to use the product, our baby was much bigger and she found it uncomfotable to hold him on the pillow.However, many of our friends have used it with their babies for much longer, which is why I recommend you wait until after the baby comes to buy this product.I bought this before my daughter was born and was pretty disappointed right from the start.first of all it's a pain to put around and close it while having to hold a baby.My daughter never layed on it properly and I still had to use 2 extra pillows to put her in a good nursing position.Now my daughter is 3 months and doesn't fit on it anymore.I am not happy with this product and wouldn't buy it again if I had the choice...Bought one and tried and tried and cannot get any kind of consistent reading with it.We read all the directions and followed instructions and nothing seemed to improve accuracy.It doesn't seem to be better on the forehead or the ear.It just doesn't work reliably at all.I would never trust this to take my infant's temperature.Luckily, the return with amazon was hassle free.This thermometer is about as good as not having one at all.Each consecutive reading will have several degrees difference, so you have no idea what the true temperature is.i loved the idea, i still use it a little bit for a quick reading BUT i can do it 3 times in a row and get 3 differant reading on it!i really wish it worked, HONESTLY just get a regular thermometer and do it the old ways to get the best temp.and most of the time the hospital will give you one to take home with you anyways!The bobby is cute and soft, but did not provide the support needed for nursing my infant daughter.I don't like that my pillow, which I was given from a friend, is foam without a cover.The only downside to this pillow is that putting the cover back on is a bit cumbersome.However, it is much better than the Bobby.One idea I got from the lactation consultant is to put a blanket on top of the cover when nursing or burping baby, that way if baby burps up milk or has a diaper blowout, you can just throw the blanket in the hamper and get another clean one.It is also helpful to buy a spare cover so one is always clean.I have both Boppy and My Breast Friend, and I love both for different reasons.Boppy of course is great for tummy time and reclining the baby (she can't sit up yet, only 9 weeks old).I keep the Boppy in her room and I use it to feed her when I'm sitting in her rocking chair, because the arms of the chair hold the Boppy perfectly in place for me.My Breast Friend is great exclusively for feeding, but I have more freedom with it than with Boppy.MBF is large enough to hold baby in place even when I walk around the house (I still have to hold the bottom of the pillow of course to support her weight and for safety).So I can use it in living room, get up and walk to the bedroom, sit in front of computer, etc.Snapping it on can be a little cumbersome, you do need two hands.Usually if I'm holding the baby, my husband will hook it on for me, he laughs because he thinks it's funny-looking but agrees it is the MOST comfortable thing to wear while holding baby, because it practically holds her for you!I really dont like this pillow at all.Its to hard (not firm but hard) Its not comfortable to wear & I cant use this pillow for the football hold since the way the curve of the pillow is made.Im upset I wasted so much money on this pillowI was lucky enough to receive both the boppy and the brest friend pillow.Both have their uses so it depends on your needs.The brest friend pillow was wonderful for a new mom breastfeeding.I had difficultly in the hospital as I was a new mom and never breast feed before and my baby was sleepy and new at breast feeding also.I tried to use pillows on the hospital bed, but it was difficult.Once I came home and used the brest friend pillow, I had no problem.I tried the boppy, but found my daughter would sink into it and not be in a proper position for feeding.The boppy is great for other uses besides breast feeding.You can also use it to support the baby when the baby is ready to sit up by themselves.I was having a hard time getting my baby to latch on when he was born so he wasn't feeding well and therefore losing weight quickly.I have two Boppi's but at the time, they were too soft and low to be of much support.The Brest Friend offered great back support and was firm enough so that the baby didn't sink down.It held my baby right under breast level so he could reach the nipple easily and in relative comfort.I was able to monitor the latching on, rather than worry about how to keep my baby at the breast.I was aghast at the expense but with this pillow's help, I was able to finally get my baby to feed and he's gained weight steadily.Unfortunatley I've had to stop using the My Brest Friend cause he's too big and too heavy for it.The pillow is a bit cumbersome.It was a pain to have to unbuckle myself when I had a baby who'd passed out on milk in my arms and was trying to get him into the crib without waking him up.Also when my baby got too heavy, the pillow started to pull me down so the back strap is no longer supporting my back.Overall, I loved the My Brest Friend.It was a wonder to have when I was first breastfeeding.Even though I can't really use it for my baby now, I would totally recommend it for any first time mothers.Don't buy a boppy for breast feeding- it is crappy and has NO support!I have no idea where mine is- waste of money.Anyways being a first time mom this pillow is a life saver!It's soft and helped me out a lot- still does!It supports her firmly and helped me get her latched quickly.I highly recommend this pillow- make sure you buy the deluxe it's super soft and the pocket up front is great to hold a phone, clicker, water- whatever.Also it is FULLY adjustable!I have a giant bike and giant baby bike seat.Now I can carry a few things with me without having to wear backpack!We are doing a 30 mile Hospice ride so super releived.Old review - Got bag thinking it could be carried with a strap-due to a review on Amazon.This bag only can be 'carried' by attaching to a stroller.But seeing as I have a mcClaren and I need the storage, this will be very useful.Matches our kitchen decor...Functional, looks nice...our other bottle rack looked stupid and cheap...made things look cluttered.This one makes things look organized...However, it isn't quite as practical as I'd thought, given the amount of bottles, nipples, pacis, pump parts etc.The product is not really big enough to carry that many of these baby essentials, and when they are all piled up on it, the items don't seem to dry all that quickly and/or topple off when I am spinning it to get to the other side.Despite sitting at the bottom of lunch bag without anything disturbing it, it leaked during firs time use.I ended up returning it.I cannot for the life of me figure out why companies manufacture anything made of cloth that cannot be immersed in water for cleaning purposes for children.As cute as this teether is and as much as my daughter likes it, what good is it if it cannot be properly washed?The directions on the product say to "surface wipe".That is dumb.I like this but would have preferred that the company manufacture something that could be immersed in water and properly cleaned.Annoyed...The bear is actually not very cute to me but my 6 month old loves this so I do too!She can easily grab onto the rings or grab onto the blanket part of the bear's body and pass it from one hand to the other.Even though she's teething, she doesn't like the teethers as much as the rings.It is a very LOUD toy as another reviewer said because the body of this bear blanket makes that crinkly sound that babies love so much.A great toy for home, in the car or on the go!Overall this is a fun and educational toy for my little one.my 4mo old loves the mat and cover...yet doesn't love the spin feature.He's ok -not great- with tummy time and I was hoping this would help.Sometimes it works for a few minutes, other times not at all.It also seems to bother his tummy a bit- can be a plus if you just can't get that burp out...after he comes up from this there it is!But again, he loves staring at the mat while sitting on my lap...or even if i hold it up for him to play with he is excited...would love it more if he used the spinner...He likes the crinkling sound, the low bell sound, the mirror.Now if I look in the mirror when he's looking, he gets all excited by my deformed reflection.Lamaze makes a very high quality soft toy.Like the others my grandson has been given, the Clutch Cube Baby Toy is very well made.The seams are securely sewn.The hidden panel which opens to reveal a mirror provides the element of surprise to entertain baby.My only criticism is that this cube is rather large and is hard for younger infants to handle.I question whether older infants who are large enough to handle this toy will find it interesting.For a six month old who is very interested, this toy is just too large to handle and Grandma ends up manipulating it to entertain baby.But since he can't type, I'll do it for him.This is a great toy.I put this down near her and she will stop moving and stare at it, which really helps get the diaper changes over with quickly.The only complaint is that there is not much for her to grab onto other than the little string feet.But overall the quality is nice and I have washed it once with no harm done to the little guy.Our 3 month old loves playing with this toy.She loves the sounds, like the crinkling and the tune it plays.She seems to stay more entertained with this one than her other toys.It is very easy to hold as she starts to grab at things.When she was old enough to grab him by herself she delighted in the crinkling of his feathers.As she gets older and interested in flashier toys Jacques has taken a bit of a backseat but when it's wind down time or she wants a bit of comfort Jacques seems to do the trick.I got this for my baby when he was 2 months old.He wasn't that interested in toys yet, but he was quickly drawn to Jacques.I keep it clipped by his car seat.We have a Freddy the Firefly too, but I think my kid prefers Jacques, which kinda surprised me because Freddy looks a little more interesting to me.But Jacques is definitely a good buy.When he was around 2 months of age, he became fascinated with this toy.Any time he is starting to get fussy, Jacques comes to the rescue!My son's now 5 months old and is still enamored with this toy.When we're in the car and I hook it to the handle he can't stop staring at it and he's always trying to grab at it.I had some previous toys hanging from the handle prior to buying Jacques and he never ever seemed interested in those.Plus, when he's crying I just use Jacques to cheer him up and he'll automatically stop!:) Buy him if you haven't already!Then as your child gets older you can turn it to the front and they can play with everything.My daughter loves Jacque and looking at him as well as grasping the crinkly feathers.We were amazed to see how much our baby immediately liked looking at this toy.Within weeks we hung Jacques from our baby gym and our baby was hitting it and making it spin.It has been a great toy to travel with because it has so many different stimulating things.One of the feathers is a mirror, one is a squeak toy, one makes a crinkly sound.She can pick him up now and turn him around and attempt to eat his feathers.Overall, he's a lot of fun.And he conveniently hooks onto everything.He was fascinated enough to play with him for a few hours when I first have it to him but he doesn't really even want to play with him now.On an occasion I can get him to play with him for a few mins, but he's basically bored with him quickly!I put him on the floor as an option for him to play with.I rate this as an, " OK toy. "He is older now, but still likes Jacques.He was her favorite toy to bat at and inspect.It is a well made toy and I would recommend it to anyone.I purchased this after a good friend of mine told me it was it a hit with her neice.Its one of my favorite purchases.Its probabaly the first toy she actually showed interest in.We got both the Firefly and the Peacock Lamaze toys and my baby loves them both equally.I had read good reviews on these toys and the reviews were right!My baby is nearly six months old now and began playing with these about a month ago.These are some of her favorite toys overall.I think that although the Lamaze toys are a bit more expensive than others, that they are well worth the price.not bad....but not as good as the firefly and the vibrating bug.I think these are all a matter of babys taste.Love this toy and so does our baby.There is so much to look at, it still keeps him fascinated for long periods (20 minutes or so).She smiles at it, tries to "talk" to it, and loves to hold on to it.The hook is great, too, because we can take it with us and not loose it.Dogs LOVE this toy too!!!My toy poodle is well behaved and never tries to get it, but I see that she wants to.We swap them up so she doesn't get bored with them.Lamaze toys are great!It keeps him busy.This toy was one of the first that our baby liked as an infant.So much, in fact, that I kept it stored away because he helped us through many car rides and dinners out.He kept the baby's attention and she loved playing with his "crinkle" wings and sucking on his face.Other similar toys just didn't cut the muster compared to Jacques.I thought I'd try the other Lamaze toys, which are similar to Jacques...I think I had the Moose and something else, but she didn't care for them.This was one of the very first toys I introduced to our baby after we brought him home from the hospital.After a few weeks, he enjoyed hearing it crinkle when I put it by his feet to play.At three months, he still enjoyed watching me have it 'flap' its wings and fly by his head.He's 7 months now, and still gets excited when I bring it back into his toy rotation.The hook on top is handy to clip to the diaper bag, since the toy is a little big and bulky to put inside the diaper bag.My 4 month old loves this toy!She stares at the black and white patterns on the back, chews on all sides of him and loves to "toss" him from side to side.The toy itself is well made and durable.She chews and drools all over him and there is no wear.The squeaker is a little difficult to push, but she'll grow into that.I recommend this toy for any munchkin.I bought 4 Lamaze toys based on their 5 stars reviews, Buzz the Bug, Freddie the Firefly, Mortimer the Moose, and Jacques the Peacock.When she was born I show her the High contrast Black and White dots on jack's wings, and she was so mesmerized for several minutes..While I agree that all Lamaze baby products are good and worth buying, but I think 1 or 2 is enough.When he was a month old he was already interested in it - would look at it for long periods of time and try to swat at it.The back side of the peacock features black and white patterned fabrics that are very high contrast to allow very young infants to focus on them.I think that this is a great toy for little young ones.He rattles and squeeks.He also has a mirror patch so that the little one can see her beautiful reflection!It's bright, durable and has a variety of surfaces to feel and chew on.The only minus is the manufacturere's instruction to surface clean only.Mortimer the Moose is another quality baby toy from Lamaze.The various colors make Mortimer interesting to look at; the colors are vivid and eye-catching.Mortimer is a loveable moose with his coat is soft and his loveable, friendly expression.The hard antlers are perfect for baby to gnaw on when teething makes gums uncomfortable.Construction on this toy is very good.The seams are well finished and do not appear to be ones that will break quickly - regardless of the abuse Mortimer receives.The plastic ring and the antlers are textures, but have no rough edges to injure baby.I definitely recommend Lamaze toys for your child or grandchild.its ok. Not my babys favorite but will sometimes play with.I really like this toy, it is great for babies, it was a little bigger than I expected.My 4 months old is still figuring it out.He can't hang on to it very well yet, He will soon though and I think he will really like it!Our baby loves this toy.We hang it over her changing table, and it is a happy diversion.This is actually our second Mortimer.One of the dogs "ate" the first one.She plays well with her other toys, but Mortimer keeps her interested and contented the longest.This toy is great.I hang it over her pack-n-play and she like to bat at it.My daughter prefers Jaque the Peacock, but Mortimer serves it's purpose as a toy.We always take Mortimer with us on long road trips, it will occupy and entertain my son when he becomes fussy in his car seat.Buy Mortimer the Moose, your child will love it too!My daughter played with this toy since she could grab things.It has multiple things that attract a baby.Its so cute and big and it had little jingle bells in the feet.I even found myself staring at it!:) This is a toy ill keep in his chest forever for us to look back on one day.At first I was disappointed because I wanted something cuter looking and thought he was too big.He can also manage to grab the tail rings and even somehow works his arm into the clip ring.As he learns to bring things to his mouth, Mortimer's nose and feet offer some interesting textures.He can stare at it for quite awhile with all it's colors and contrast which makes it great for car rides.It has a lot of different textures and sounds from squeak to crackle.Good toy, good price.My daughter is just under 3 months and this is the first toy I've really seen her get excited about.I'm a little worried about the pointy antlers, but she hasnt done any damage yet :)Super cute.I ordered the peacock for her for easter and I hope she loves it as much.I have the Peacock, the Giraffe and the Firefly, and it seems with all the crinkling (from the Firefly & Peacock) my daughter would become over-stimulated and actually would get upset after playing with them for a while.The whole series is great though I can dangle them from her play mat, her car seat, her bouncy chair, and I can even get them to dangle from her jumperoo.My baby loves this toy.Her and I play with it together in a bed and I give it to her when she is in a bouncer and in a stroller.It is very bright and very functional, wich shakers and hoops.Although the bug is cute, my daughter really wasn't into it.She started out with the Eric Carle ladybug that is similar overall, but she preferred the ladybug to the bug.Baby boy really started to love this bug hanging from his car seat at almost 3 mo.The colors, crinkle paper, squeaks, and rings..This is a very cute toy and a great idea.My daughter loves to squeeze the different arms to hear the different notes.I also wish it wasn't as heavy, but it's still a decent toy.Don't be intimidated.The description says front and center that a young child won't be able to use this properly, but somehow I missed it and was a little disappointed that my almost 7 month old still can't manipulate the toy to squeak (which, in my mind, is the toy's main attribute).It is certainly cute as a stuffed animal and has some visual interest, but the musical features are thus far lost on her.Even as an adult, I will say it is not the easiest to get each leg to squeak correctly (as in enough to play a tune from the song book) -- sometimes the squeak fails and you have to reposition your hands.So far my child mainly seems to like to suck on and grab the crinkly handle on top, so she does get some use from it, but not as I intended!Maybe as she gets older, but as I mentioned, I still don't think it squeaks as reliably as it should.He stares at it and when we play music, he'll laugh and talk.When he's crying on his swing or in his carseat, we'll just plop it on his lap and he'll stop and stare and start talking.Its so cute.It is a great way to play with your baby.I don't mind the limited music library as I can make up my own tunes and the baby doesn't care if you're off key.The only thing that is bothersome is some of the legs are hard to squeeze to make sounds even for adults which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.He loves to squeeze the entire toy and I imagine that by 1 year he should have no problem squeezing the arms himself.I has a strong vanilla smell although I do worry how it has that smell (I assume some not so friendly chemicals but I do not know for sure)5) Large!Not some tiny toy that a kid can just throw aroundCons:1) A little difficult to squeeze the arms for a very young child.They are also very cute.My baby LOVES this toy.Her daddy has now named him "ocho", so cute.She loves playing with all of the toys on it.The best part is that it can sit on her legs when she is riding in the car.My son loves this toy, we put any toy through the holes and help him find them.Non conventional perhaps, but he is learning about object permanence for sure!The squeaker in this colorful toy never fails to produce a grin!Overall, my kiddo and I are pretty satisfied with Patty.Then you get paranoid that the little animals will fall off and land in your kids mouth.the socks do not stay on my daughter's chubbilicious feet.At four months she has just started grabbing her little tootsies and these feet-finders are super cute but 1, aren't shaped like a sock to accommodate the heel and consequently come off rather easily and 2, are a bit tight (but dont seem to have any elasticity to them) and are hard to keep pulling back on my baby's feet.my bb is 18 weeks and the velcro on the wrist band can just manage to meet at both ends on her wrist.Its not gonna be good for bigger babies.My 3 month old daughter doesn't really like to look at them but she love to eat the bee ... hahai put them on her play mat and she looks at them.the socks are way to small for her big feet but i am going to take the bugs off and put them on sock that fit her, hopefully that will work :)These rattles aren't very loud and she seemed annoyed having them on her ankles and wrists.They are very cute.First off - these are very cute.I love the design and the bugs' cute little faces.They fit on my daughter's feet when she's wearing a sleeper, and fit well around her wrists.My only gripe is that the "rattle" isn't very loud at all.It seems too quiet to get a baby excited, and in fact, I'm not sure that the rattling is loud enough to grab a baby's attention.(If you add in the noises of older siblings, a washing machine that is always running, etc - a baby wouldn't think much of the rattle.)great gift idea.she cooes and tries to grab them.keeps her entertained.These are a bunch of really fun toys for the little ones.We had a blast when our grandson discovered he has feet with the help of the foot finder.Adorable product.Cute concept.But my daughter didn't give a crap about them.If anything they only got in her way while she was trying to get her hands in her mouth.Unfortunately, she doesn't seem to take very much interest in the wrist rattles.I agree w/one reviewer who said that they don't rattle very much unless you really shake them hard, which it doesn't look like a baby would do?Also, another reviewer mentioned that the foot socks are not stretchable so it's rather difficult to slip the foot finders on & off my little girl's feet -- they seem to barely fit and she is at 50% weight for her age!So I slip them on her hands instead but all she does is stare at them...Only had this for a few days but baby, mom and dad are pleased with it so far.The colors/lights are more impressive at night or in a low light room.She is now 7 months old and is still in love with this toy.Now that she is older, she plays it on her own and is still just as much in love with it.Sadly the batteries have died and the screw is stuck.That's the only thing I do not like about this toy.The screw for the batteries is really REALLY deep into the plastic.So when we tried to unscrew it, it got halfway out and got stuck.This toy is great.Not only does my 6.5-month-old daughter love it, but it doesn't drive my husband and me crazy.It has 3 music settings so you don't hear the same 1 or 2 songs over and over, and the music is delicate and quiet (not digital and loud like most baby toys).This is a definite winner in our house.My 4 1/2 old is not impressed by much except an O-ball rattle and his own feet, but I introduced him to Freddie this week and he is in love!I highly recommend as a baby gift or for soon-to-be moms!Great toy!Plus it is great hanging it from her gym and she can grab the click clack rings to pull on and play with too.I can see her enjoying this toy for months to come.My son has had this toy since he was only a few weeks old and it has been his favorite since then!!There are so many things for him to do with Freddie!!The wings crinkle, which keeps him busy most of the time.He also loves the mirrors and the pull rings on the bottom.My baby (4 months) never seems to get bored with this toy.I even take it away from her sometimes so she won't get tired of playing with it, but she always cries when I do!A great buy.My baby loves playing with this toy after 4 months - there are so many parts of it that hold her attention.Prior to that, she didn't seem interested, so I tried to attach it to her crib to look at.The "clip" is really a single piece of hard plastic with a 1/8 inch gap to one side.In order to attach it, I had to twist the plastic and slide it onto the crib railing.It hurt my hand and scratched little dents onto the wooden railing because the plastic is thick and the clip hard to open up.The only place it can be hooked up to is the play mat or activity center with the arches.One other annoying thing is that the instructions say "surface wash only."Considering that this toy is probably meant to be chewed and slobbered on, I was disappointed that you're not supposed to wash the insides (which might be soaked with slobber).most of my children would have a short phase and get tired of it eventually.but this toy is fab.he's much better than Jacques the peacock because he's easier to grab and they practically the same except freddie has the 2 teething rings at the end of his tail.overall a great buy for a toy.We got both the Firefly and the Peacock Lamaze toys and my baby loves them both equally.I had read good reviews on these toys and the reviews were right!My baby is nearly six months old now and began playing with these about a month ago.These are some of her favorite toys overall.I think that although the Lamaze toys are a bit more expensive than others, that they are well worth the price.*** UPDATE APRIL 2011:  I have machined washed this several times (line dried) and it still looks brand new.Nothing has torn off or faded.My daughter did not really take to it until she was 3 months old, though -- don't think newborns are going to get much out of this.The only con (my opinion) is that this is a cloth toy that cannot be submerged in water.It can only be surface wiped which I don't like for sanitary reasons... She is in teething mode and constantly putting it in her mouth.That said, it is a very nice interactive toy with lots to look at, touch, shake, squeeze and pull.The wings even make a crinkling/crackling noise somewhat similar to a potato chip bag.Interesting little toy.Our baby is 9 weeks old and loves to look at both sides of this toy - the black and white side and the side with the face.It hangs perfectly in her jungle gym so when she lies down she can grab the rings on the bottom of the firefly.I got this toy for my daughter before she was even born.We use it every single day and do not go anywhere without "Buggy."You can hang it in the car or on the car seat.We look forward to seeing her discover all the goodies this has to offer her in the coming months.I think my daughter's favorite aspect of this toy is his loud, crinkly wings.She loves to bang on it.A second attraction are the three rings.Now that she is teething the white attachment ring is new favorite thing to chew on.She shows no interest in the small mirror or red teething apple, except to pull at it.The length of this toy makes it great for attaching high so she can reach for it and grab at it, which may have contributed to her great hand-eye coordination.The firefly also seems more entertaining to her than the Lamaze Moose, which she also likes.I highly recommend this toy.one of my 4mo olds favorites...we have all of these, and this one and the shutterbug (not sure if that is right...it's the one that has a bug and flower) are his favorites.Loves the crinkles, contrast on back of wings.It just facinates her.We have had many peaceful meals while she grabs, chews, tugs and crinkles this toy.Update - My LO is 18 months now and played with this toy until she was about 6-7 months old.We got many peaceful dinners out of it.Still love this toy.I'd previously wiggled it from time to time for him, but his eyes would wander after a minute or two.The day he 'looked' at it, I took it down and his eyes got so wide like he couldn't believe it was possible for this thing to come nearer.He shoved the face in his mouth.Now it's part of his regular rotation of slobber objects.He loves the face for mawing on and likes the thin wings for gumming.He's also totally into grabbing the red bug and the rings.I'm sure any one of the Lamaze toys could be just as loved, but this is the one we happen to have.My 5-month-old loves to play with this on the bar of his stroller.It makes trips to Target much less boring for my little guy!It makes a great gift.Lamaze has a good reputation and the product is well made - no recall worries.Works well for newborns and into the first toddler stages.My baby is 4 months old and has loved this toy since she was about 3 months old.She'd just stare and stare at it!Now that she can grab and grasp things, this toy is even more of a delight.I had to purchase "Marina the Mermaid" as well as Freddy!Now, at 4 months, it's his favorite toy.My son will play with this toy for a half hour, crinkling the wings and chewing on pretty much every part of Freddie.This is a great stroller/car seat toy, there are so many features to engage baby (crinkly wings, peekaboo mirror, strawberry teether, etc).The toy is easy to clean, just hand wash and air dry.The only thing I don't like about Freddie is the squeaker, it can be annoying loud.Overall, I highly recommend buying Freddie the Firefly or any other Lamaze products, they make great first toys for your baby!When we first had my son, we had Freddie the Firely and the Lamaze Bug toy, and they were two of the favorite things to have around.When he was just a few weeks old, he used to look at the back of the firefly (black and white patterned) and eventually grew into playing with the crackling wings and teething on the rings.I was hesitant to purchase such an expensive toy for an infant, but it has been worth every penny.This will be my "must buy" for all baby showers!I wanted something that he can practice grasping and improve his coordination, that's fun, portable, with fun colors and BPA free.Well-this toy does just that!!It also keeps my son entertained for a while, I can hang it from his crib or car seat, and he really enjoys it.I'm sure that he will use this toy for several more moths as it has many hidden "treasures".So baby is happy, and when baby is happy, mom, dad and everyone else around are happy!she's had it since she was about 4 months old and is now 18 months.we keep it around just because, and she still plays with him every once in a while.it went everywhere with her when she was still an infant and she loved to stare at him.That's a very educational toy.That's so colorful, has rings, a mirror, a plastic bug, a squeezing toy and is made of different textures.The only con is that it's not machine washable.We now use it as a distraction toy, it hangs on son's stroller and when he tries to take his socks off or just feels fussy I give it to him and that's it.Freddie the Firefly is an excellent toy, a lot of entertainment in one small little guy!It is his favorite toy!The little mirror on the wing is also perfect for babies around 2-3 months when they really start noticing their reflections.The toy has a squeaky wing, that my son loves to squeeze now.It is an excellent distractor when you are out shopping/strolling with your little one, as you can stick it on to the bar of any car seat or stroller canopy you have.Definitely a must buy for any new parent.I bought this toy for my daughter right after she turned 3 months old.She adores this toy, and "coos" whenever she plays with it.She hasn't figured out how to make it squeak yet, but she likes the crinkly wings and she rubs her hands over the different textures.The clip is very handy.My son has had Freddy for quite some time but it has recently become a favorite (he is now 7 months).Great toy!She will play with him for hours if it's just in her car seat or during tummy time at home.My baby absolutely loves this toy... so much so that I had to buy a second one after she chewed through the foot of the first one and exposed some plastic and the stuffing.This is the only reason why I gave this giraffe only 4 stars instead of 5.She can't keep any part of the giraffe out of her mouth.I would have preferred that this giraffe have been a bit more durable.My baby doesn't even have any teeth, but she was able to chew through the stitching of one of the giraffe's feet.This doll is really cute and has many things to keep a baby's attention.It has rattles, different textures, and a crinkling dress.I really like this toy and my baby loves it.I just got this mirror and took it out of the box for my son to play with during tummy time.I read the reviews on it and decided on this one because of the wedge (so I wouldn't have to prop it up) and the ability to attach it to the crib or various other places.I guess I must not understand what that means because I think the mirror still kinda distorts images!But for a safety mirror, I guess it's good enough.I ordered it anyways keeping that in mind, but hoping to get the orange one still.Kind of disappointed, but the backside of the purple is very pretty.Overall, it's a nice safety mirror.Aside from what everyone else has said about this product(simple yet versatile-can be removed from its base to hook onto a playmat or crib bars), I loved that the soft mirror can be removed from its pocket and turned over if it gets badly scratched.I have used this for both of my little ones and when I realized the mirror was easily removeable and two-sided I was excited that my second child could have a brand new scratch-free surface to look into.This product is definitely worth the $.We use it a lot during tummy time, as an incentive for him to roll over and we've also hung it in his crib for playtime.Well worth the money!!Tucker certainly is a cute toy with what I thought was sure to include a lot of appeal for my daughter but she's never shown much interest in him.Perhaps his shapes, hidden textures and mirror are better suited for a slightly older baby who is past the 'bang on anything and everything' phase; maybe 12+ months.I am looking forward to reintroducing Tucker to her once she is crawling around.I believe Tucker will be a friendly educational/discovery toy once my daughter is more interested.To each baby his or her own!This toy is so neat!The mirror is amazing - it's not distorted like all the other baby toy mirrors I've ever seen.Its legs makes different sounds, and it's sooo soft.Plus it can attach to car seat, stroller, etc.Tucker the Turtle was a lifesaver on an 8-hour car ride with a 4-month-old earlier this summer.When my son got fussy, I held the mirror in front of him, and he would study himself for a good long while.Now at 5 months old, he holds Tucker and cuddles him.Tucker also rides on the stroller and a baby hand is always hanging onto him.*** UPDATE ***With a 15-pound baby, the entire frame rocks and sways.One of the four 'feet' actually hops up into the air by around an inch.When the baby was 7 pounds, it had a great fast swing on the high setting.Now, it has a pretty lethargic swing.Original review:When the swing is first started, it makes a mildly annoying grinding noise.I like that it has four swing settings, two volume levels for sound, and an on/off function for the mobile.The fabric seat is attractive and washable, and the mobile animals are colorful and brightly contrasting.The biggest drawback is the mobile itself, which is so noisy (another annoying grinding sound) I no longer turn it on.Overall, it is comfortable, cute and functional, and just too cute to send back!We LOVE this swing!!We have been using this swing for 8 weeks now and baby LOVES it.I LOVE the fact it plugs in the outlet, Never have to spend money on batteries again :)Baby enjoys the option of front swinging or the cradle swing motions.He is now also enjoying the motion of the toys.He still loves it, we haven't had any problems with it at all.I would recommend this swing to any and everyone!!My baby loved this, but the toy bar has a frog that moves and it broke right away.The gears got messed up or something and it began to make this loud clicking and grinding sound.This upset my baby and also upset me since I payed so much for this.I have since read other reviews that say theirs did this same thing, so it must be a flaw with the whole line of these and not just mine.I read lots of reviews before purchasing this bouncer and saw that some people mentioned very loud music, toys hanging too low and some clicking sound as the main issues with it.I don't find the music being too loud whatsoever, there are two setting, the lower one is really low and the louder one is not too loud at all.The toys do hang low but that's because the baby is supposed to reach and touch them in order for the music to start playing.My baby likes the bouncer and I think it is a great bouncer for the price.Most of the gear we got for our baby became useless within a couple months, but not this seat.As a newborn, she loved just sitting in the chair and staring at the waterfall.Now, at almost 5 months, she plays with the parrot and monkey and can keep herself entertained while we have dinner or get some chores done.I also really like how easy it is to get the bar on and off.Overall, a great buy!It's an improvement over an older model we had for our first child.Otherwise it's great, and we just learned to live the clicks.The price was right.My local Sears had it for $19.99!I bought this one based on all the good reviews on Amazon and the Babies R Us website.The lights from the waterfall and the music gets him so excited!First, I like the many different settings it offers.It also can play animal sounds in place of the music.Second, the battery life lasts a long time.The entire bouncer is very easy to assemble and disassemble with a phillips head screw driver.Lastly, I love the vibrating chair.Its very soothing and he has taken short naps there on many occasions.This was a great buy and I would buy it again!It does require 4 size D batteries, so keep that in mind.I like this bouncer a lot, and if you want a nice bouncer like this one you should hurry and buy it, because it is becoming harder and harder to find.I recommend it!I admit that I agreed with my son-in-law, at first, on the Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer - it seemed like it would not be particularly useful.Then the little one arrived, and we both changed our minds.This is definitely an essential piece of equipment for any little one - and an even more essential piece of equipment for the adults caring for the baby.Like all Fisher-Price products, this is a well made item.The cloth seating area is nicely finished and the fabric is not cheap or scratchy.If necessary, and it will be, the cover removes easily for washing.The seat can be inclined as the baby grows to allow for a more upright sitting position, although it does not incline enough for an fully uprighted seated position.It does not "go" continually, but requires that the baby do something to activate the music, motion, or toys.This is particularly nice if you are an individual who dislikes the continuous, automated music on some toys.At that point, the baby's weight is sufficient to prevent the upright position from being particularly useful.My baby falls asleep easily when we set it on vibrate.If she is fussy, rocking it back and forth does the job.The only drawback was after sometime the frog started clicking, very irritating, so we had to cut the line to the motor to stop it from going up and down.That solved the problem.The waterfall is very soothing to look at, and the sounds keep my baby entertained.Very neutral for both boy or girl.Tried a few others, not as great...whatever you do, you must get one that vibrates for the soothing action.You will appreciate this chair the most for that.My son is now 8 weeks old and has been enjoying his bouncy since his 1st week of life.The cover is soft & comfy.The music and noise levels are great, Lights are amazing to baby.The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is that the vibration is LOUD!Very loud so loud in fact you cant hear the music over the rattling if the seat.When we put more weight/pressure on the seat the noise lessens so Im thinking that when Baby weighs more it wont be so loud.Sometimes it's the only thing that will stop her crying.secondly, there is some kind of short circuit or something and the lights and music never stay on.Great chair.My son has been sitting in it and even falls asleep since the day we brought him home from the hospital.He will stay happily in the chair and entertain himself just fine-easy to put together-soft fabrics and they sell a replacement seat if you end of having a major blow out that can't come out of the seat if you need itCons:-the lights, the toys and the vibration is info overload.we still haven't put the light bar back on.it's too much and its right in his face and he still freaks outwould by this again b/c as he grows from day one newborn till today (almost 4 months) he is still very happy in it.can spend over an hour in it if we let him (which we don't very often).when he's fussy or after a feeding to keep him elevated this has been a god send.MAKE SURE TO TIGHTEN the straps when the baby is in the bouncy chair :)Lifesaver!Portable- so I take it in the bathroom while I take a shower or in the kitchen when I'm making dinner.I don't keep her in it that long... so she doesn't get bored.We are definitely getting our moneys worth out of it.The vibrations switch is great to help get my baby to sleep and I love the detachable bar.What's nice about this bar is that you can adjust the sound level and it has several things for the baby to play with and work on fine motor skills.Definitely recommend this one!Well, at least for 20 minutes.He gets really excited to watch the waterfall lights and see the monkey on the side move!Week 8-9 we kept the sound and motion on the continuous loop because he didn't catch on that hitting the monkey and bird hanging down would trigger the motion and sound.Now at week 11 he gets it.Our son likes to kick his feet and wave his arms at the motion of this bouncer.He hates the vibrating seat, so we don't even bother with it.This bouncer also allows us up to 20 minutes to eat dinner together, as he is massively entertained with it.Best money we've spent on a bouncer!They smile and talk to the animals.Their arms and legs are constantly moving (great baby exercise).We also use this to help with digestion.After the babies eat, we need to keep them upright for about 15 minutes before putting them down for their nap; this bouncer allows the baby to be upright and have the vibrating motion help ease out any latent bubbles (while we get their swaddles ready and make sure their humidifer is filled).However, to our disappointment the other bouncers did not offer the same level of action-reaction toys on the bouncer.Most of the other bouncers had just stuffed animals that hang from a bar (how boring).Holds much more slobber than you're typical cloth bib.Plus, if you hang it up, it drys quickly and can be used...a great feature if you're away from home for the day.We'll this may be a bit premature since we just got the cradle swing yesterday but so far here's what we think of it.First off it was a cinch to put together.With the instructions next to me I had it assembled and ready in about 30 minutes.(I just can't understand for the life of me why all of these things aren't equipped with corded power options, also makes me wonder why these models are all bunched into one review if they have different features).Once it was plugged in we put our daughter in (she is 3 weeks old), set the mobile on with no sounds and set the swing in a front-to-back rocking motion (her favorite when I'm carrying her bassinet) and she almost immediately started to doze off.Our daughter has a weak stomach muscle and spits up quite a bit of juice if we don't keep her inclined for a while after feeding.In the still position it's inclined enough to be safe for her tummy and in the side-to-side swing it also seems to be ok.However in the front-to-back motion it leans her almost flat on her back and with-in a few moments she had spit up most of her meal... lesson learned.Once she' rested this is her favorite motion and puts her to sleep fastest but she doesn't mind side-to-side either.As a matter of fact she's sleeping in it next to me on side-to-side right now while I type this and Mom is getting some much needed sleep.THE MOTORI've read a few complaints about the noise.There is a clicking sound but I believe that is because the mechanism used to rock the cradle is not a continuous rotating axle that is locked to the swing, instead it seems to be an axle that is independent of the swing arm and pushes the swing arm when it rotates.So the click is the sound of the axle pushing against the swing arm.I consider this a good thing, if the axle was locked to the swing arm then any attempt to stop the cradle by hand while it was on could damage the motor, also starting it from a dead stop would cause some strain.So it seems like a decent alternative (Of course I could be way off base here).The down side is that it doesn't seem to have much push, granted she's only 9lbs but I worry about the swing lasting till she's at the max weight (25lbs according to the manufacturer).I could be wrong and I tell you why, it rocks with the slightest push and is so lubricated and balanced that it continues to rock well for a few seconds even with the motor off.So maybe it doesn't need much to keep it going once it's going... we'll see.From what I've read I'm skeptical but I've read some reviews here that were so off base I question the source.As far as the noise, it doesn't bother her, it's about as loud as a soft finger tap on a table and it's so rhythmic that we all 3 fell asleep to it but some people are light sleepers, you may want to demo it in a store or something first to see.It also seems to help if you give it a push to get it going once you figure out the timing on the swing, once the cradle is really swinging the noise is minimal.So my only real gripe about the motor is that from the lowest setting to the highest, there's really no difference.The speed is fine, I've read some reviews about people concerned that the swing would catapult their baby across the room, either mine is busted or they got the limited, twin turbo edition by Ferrari because the pace is nice and mellow on ours.But she does like a little jiggle once in a while and while this swing will rock her slowly it's not speeding up at all.What I'd like to see is a setting for a faster jiggle without as much sway... if that makes sense, less distance more motion, kinda like a car ride which knocks her out almost immediately.The slow swing works great once she's asleep though.THE SEATThe padding is nice and soft (kind of a hammock effect under her bottom) and I really like that the head rest keeps her floppy noggin from whipping around when she squirms.In her bassinet I find her head cranked to one side a lot and it concerns me...The way it is now the whole seat cover is sewn together and would need to be washed as a whole., though it did clean up nice with some soapy water and a little rinse.THE MOBILEThe sounds are all nice and she doesn't really seem to have a preference but we like the crickets and night sounds.If you find the pictures I added you'll see what I mean, she just stares at it and makes faces.I gotta say I also like that the light keeps us able to see her in the dark so we can tell if she's awake and her eye's are open or she's just grunting/giggling in her sleep again.There are enough options to get it working just about anyway you'd like, lights and mobile, mobile only, different sounds or songs, volume control and the seemingly useless speed control.A SMALL GRIPESo then my last gripe is that, I feel like it needs a cross bar between the legs, once it's positioned it seems fine but the legs wobble when I pick the whole thing up to move it around the house and it's takes some fussing to get it flat and stable again.A cross bar would be a nice stabilizer for those of us who want this thing to be a bit more mobile, definitely not a deal breaker but it would be nice.[Update] So it turns out the one part I skipped in the manual was how to collapse the legs to help move the unit around, it's actually really helpful.My 4 month old daughter tends to take longer naps while she's being swung, however the motor is LOUD and make a constant CLUNK noise (and no, it doesnt sound like there is something wrong with it - just seems like the normal sound)right above her head and it startles her when I lay her down for a nap.The swing function really does not vary much - when she was a newborn even the slowest setting was WAY too fast (she was just under 7 lbs) and now at just under 15lbs none of the speeds make much of a difference.I'm also not really a fan of the music - it's kind of fake/tinny and actually kind of creeps me out a little bit.The colors are very muted, but she does like the lights above and they show onto the canopy very well at night with dimmed lights.This is also a very awkward swing to move and it does take up a good 3 feet of space.And then the motor broke.I used it for six months.My son wasn't ready to stop using it but I opted to use the crib full time at this point.I would have liked the opportunity to sell it, but who wants a broken swing?While it worked he did love it.But I can't give it more than one star since it gave out on me.I used a graco for my daughter that was handed down a couple of times already and it never broke.All in all, it was a really good swing but be ready for the hassle in case the motor gives.BTW he was less than 15 pounds when it broke and the max weight is 25.We borrowed our friend's Fisher Price papasan swing (made in 2006) for our first child and then bought the 2009 version for ourselves when our second came along.The 2009 version barely swings.You can hear the motor work for a moment and then nothing happens.What a disappointment.The 2006 version was totally different--it worked like a charm at calming our colicky newborn.If you get a current version of the papasan swing, my advice is to buy it at a local store and make sure that the motor functions before throwing away the box.The key is that every single setting for the swing should work--from slowest setting to fastest setting.You should not have to set it four steps up to make it work.One person can do it in no time.Which means that you don't have to spend a fortune on batteries!It has multiple buttons to control the different settings, from how fast it swings, song, volume, toy rotation and light projection.Very user friendly.Short and sweet: from my personal experience I recommend this product without a doubt.I believe you will find it very useful.we purchased the my little lamb swing for our newborn daughter and she absolutely loves it.the mobile is very cute and keeps her entertained for a long time.i'm impressed with the selection of lullabies the swing plays in addition to the waterfall, rainforest and cricket sound options.the swinging motion can be set for side to side or front to back motion and the seat adjusts from a cradle position to an upright position with one hand.the removable pillow cradles the baby's head and prevents her from bobbling around.the swing is so comfortable, our daughter prefers to nap in it instead of the crib.and she naps for much longer stretches in her swing than she will elsewhere.nothing seems to soothe her more when she's fussy than to be in her swing.we started using the mobile and music immediately after bringing her home from the hospital but didn't set the swing into motion until a month later.at the lowest swing setting, she is perfectly content.it's all operated with batteries,but so far with 2 months of continuous use, we haven't had to change the batteries yet.the lamb theme of the swing is super cute and quite neutral for a boy or girl and it doesn't clash with the decor in the house.after looking at the item in the store, i noticed that the fabric on some of the other themes available are not as plush as this particular swing.this is a small drawback to an otherwise perfect product.Multiple swing settings makes it a great buy.It stopped working about a month ago and I contacted Fisher Price and was told that there is a known motor issue that causes the motor to burn out early in its life.The very bright side is that I was also told the warranty covered the defect and that I would be sent a brand new swing since it was still under warranty.Things were made easier because I registered the product by mailing in the registration card.I really like this swing.My baby has really liked it.I like that I can switch positions because I can turn him to face wherever we are and we don't have to turn the entire swing.Also, the cover is machine washable I think (I've put it through the wash and it did fine.)This is really important because babies wet themselves and spit up all the time.There are some things I don't like.For example, the sounds are kind of lame.No one likes to go to sleep to the sound of crickets.Purple is a weird color, why couldn't it be a neutral like green?We never use the cup holder thing.It would be WAY too hard to get my baby in and out of the swing, and I don't even think my baby would be able to reach it.It does take up a lot of space, but all swings do.Overall, it is a good product, and I am happy with it.I end up pushing the swing with my hands so that it swings for a few minutes on its own inertia until I have to push it again.Maybe for older babies the first speed is ok, but not for my 3 week old.There are a lot of features on this swing that are beneficial to have with a difficult baby.Being sleep-deprived and liking the word "starlight," I hadn't realized the colors were purple.When we opened it, my husband said was "there are no gender stereotypes in this house" and built it immediately.Our newborn slept in it for several hours a day/night.Eventually we switched the seat position as his preferences changed; the multiposition seat is a big plus for this product.After a few weeks, we were not using the swing often for naps because we preferred our son to sleep in the crib.However, when he became overtired or had trouble napping, the motion could keep him asleep for 2-3hrs.Now he's almost 4months and possibly teething.He's also started having issues with short naps; as soon as he gets to REM sleep he wakes himself up and cannot fall asleep again.The Starlight Papasan is in full swing again.I don't like how far the seat reclines, or rather how far up it doesn't adjust to.Based on the flexing and motion of the swing, I cannot imagine putting a 25lb child in it as claimed in the product description.I can also see the plastic top wobble substantially when my son kicks.I don't have any other swing for comparison though.Finally, the lights have a tendency to turn off during operation and sometimes the rotating toys don't start either.Most likely, there is an issue with the switch turning it on.I've had quality issues with our Fisher Price bouncer too, which we took apart and repaired ourselves.I assume that we'd be able to fix the problems with the lights and rotating toys on the swing if we tried.We had originally bought a Graco "Soothing Center" type of swing from a co-worker sight unseen since they highly recommended it and no longer needed it.When I saw it and its horizontal side to side motion (rather than swinging motion), I was skeptical.Great swinging motion, can be adjusted to swing side to side or head to toe.2.She does spend a lot of time looking at the mobile and the mirror, perhaps the first toy-like thing that our 7 week old has really taken an interest in.4.What the heck is it with swings and batteries?A $100+ swing should have a plug.Period.You actually have to pull out a screwdriver and unscrew 4 screws to replace the batteries.Plus I just had to shell out almost $80 for 8 D rechargeable batteries and charger (4 for this, 4 for her bouncy seat).The toy tray is removable, but its not an easy task, it clips on pretty tight.We just leave it off, but when she gets older and wants it, it will be a pain to take it on and off all the time.3.I hate it when companies dictate to me how long I can let my baby listen to music.It's probably to save battery life, but see Con #1.Other thoughts-Didn't take too long to assemble, but once I did and got the batteries in, the music and sounds didn't work although the mobile and swing did.Here we go, I thought to myself.She expressed proper regret for my situation, we tried a couple things, and when all that failed, she scheduled a replacement motor/mobile/music unit to be shipped out.It's great for calming him down or getting him to nap when he's tired and fighting sleep when nothing else we try will work.well our little boy is 4 months old and we have been using this swing every day and every night for 4 months and we couldn't live with out it.being able to turn it in 3 different directions with out moving the actual swing is the best!!HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SWING!We had the Graco Luvin Hugs swing before, which broke after about 3 months.We could tell the Fisher Price swing was better made the moment we got it out of the box.For anyone having trouble deciding between Graco & FP, here is my assessment:Things I like:Starlight mobile is motorized, and the baby loves the starlights & curtains (Graco mobile was not motorized, and was pretty much pointless)Swing has two modes - back & forth, & side to side - switching between them is EASYMusic and nature sounds (bird & cricket chirping) sound quality is MUCH better than the Graco swingThe seat looks much more comfortable, and upholstery is softerThings I don't like:Wide base takes up more space than the Graco SwingBaby gets feet stuck under tray - i had to take it offSongs do not randomize like with the Graco swing.It starts with the same song (Cannon in D) every time you turn it on.It can get a little tedious.The mobile makes a very loud clicking sound if it gets caught on something or the baby grabs it - you can hear it all over the house (scared me the first time I heard it)This swing does not have True-Speed (I don't think Graco did either, but I know Bright Starts swings do), which basically means as the baby gets heavier, the swing slows down and you have to manually adjust the speed settingThe seat is smaller than the Graco swing and supports less weight (25 lbs vs 30 lbs)Head rest is not detachable, only adjustable.All in all, it is suitable for what we use it for - keeping baby entertained while we eat dinner.I still definitely recommend it over Graco.Very cute swing.The motor is a little loud, but it's the first swing that I've purchased, so I don't have anything else to compare it to.I wish it had an option to sit more upright (the upper setting is still pretty low).It's a lighter somewhat-girly purple.All the pics show baby boys in the swing and it looks pretty blue to me, but my husband and I were shocked at how purple it really is!He's 15 lbs, and the swing seems to have trouble getting him going.It doesn't swing him very hard, even at the highest setting, but he doesn't seem to mind.I ordered this swing on Monday, received it today (Friday of the same week), and my 6-week old is already asleep in it after about 15 minutes of her first time in it.Now that is great news for mommy!So far, so good.I will update my review if anything changes as we use it more but so far I am happy!Update:  My first baby LOVED this swing and I thought all babies would love it too.However, my second baby didn't care for it and preferred a bouncer.I guess every baby is different :)I LOVE this swing.I had it on my baby registry at Target and didn't get it, glad I found it $50 cheaper and free shipping here on Amazon.It has a lot of options.It was simple to put togehter, (don't forget to buy D batteries)!Also glad it is gender neutral, I got it for my baby boy.Pros: storable, easy to set up, easy to use, lots of different music  & sound effects (with an auto shut-off timer), adjustable 3 ways, comfortable, secure, lightweight, storable, includes a rotating mobile, and most importantly it puts our baby to sleep quickly and she stays asleep in it for hoursCons: none really but I suppose it's not totally portable although moving it isn't that difficultBottom Line: you have to get oneWe loved this baby swing!Not only is it soothing for her but also gives mommy and daddy a little break.When she was a newborn she fell asleep in it every time but now at five months she likes to watch the little bear orbit.Now that she is older she doesn't stay in it too long because she is a lot more active but it is still something good to have.This swing is amazing.We originally purchased the "nature" version of this swing at a garage sale before our baby was born, just to see if she liked it.But we started chowing through the D batteries, b/c she slept in it for every nap and all night long.I had registered the product when we first purchased it, so they just verified our information, and shipped us out a new motor (the entire top part of the swing).It was on back-order, so they did offer us the option of purchasing a new swing and then reimbursing us the cost, but we didn't mind waiting and luckily our baby transitioned to her crib just fine.We've had the new motor now for over 2 months and it works flawlessly.Baby still naps in her swing a few times a week and she loves the pretty stars and moons pattern, all of the music, and will now giggle and play in the swing vs. just napping in it.I highly recommend this product to all of my friends who are about to become parents.We bought this swing secondhand, and it failed within a few days.My husband found by searching with google that the swing can be refurbished by replacing the motor with one from an airwick air freshener - there is a website detailing how to make the fix.Now the swing works well and my little one is enjoying it.I am somewhat shocked that this product uses such a cheap motor, but I guess it makes sense considering how frequently they fail.We love this swing.It keeps my newborn busy for some time.This is the only place -aside from grandma's arms- that he takes a daytime nap.It makes my baby's head tilt down.I am always worried that he won't be able to breathe.I try to prop him up higher so this does not happen.If he were taller (he is 21 inches now), this would not be a problem.Otherwise, it would have been 10 stars.We have had the Dora The Explorer Soft Potty Seat (Superstyle Pink) for months now and while it serves its purpose, it was only working ok for us - slid all over, didn't fit well inside the ring and would slide around while she was on it, would stick to my daughter's legs and then drop loudly back onto the toilet, etc.She still likes it and will use it, but I wanted a sturdier seat that wouldn't slide and also wanted the wall hanging capability.Searched for weeks, reading reviews and this Duck seat stands above the rest for a few reasons.Great reviewsGREAT price (compared to baby bjorn, prince lionheart, etc)Does not slide very easilyHas option of using the pegs to make the fit better on your toiletCute duck that my daughter just lovesHangs on a wall (another feature my daughter loves - she gets excited to use to the potty by getting the duck off the wall and on the potty all by herself)The seat is angled so it's very comfy, also the angle helps with, well, angling the kids a little so the pee goes straight into the toilet as opposed to underneath the seat!Lightweight yet sturdy!!Should be very easy to cleanThe cons:the hook to hang on the wall is made of the rubbery material so it might break after some heavy toddler usagethe pegs to make the toilet seat fit as snugly as possible are huge in comparison to the holes they're supposed to fit into and not sure I want to bang them in with some kind of hammer and risk breaking the whole thing.Flipside of this con - the seat really does not slide and hardly lifts up, so they're almost not necessary!All in all,Great product, great price, my daughter loves her ducky seat, and she seems comfortable sitting on it!This latch was completely useless on my cabinets.The handles went completely through, and the plastic itself is flimsy enough for a strong toddler to break it anyway (even if it fit).Too bad - great idea, horrible execution.I wish the bottles came with these caps.They're great for travel and are a necessity when you're needing to shake up formula in the bottles.The Baby Delight Supreme Snuggle Nest Sheets are soft and snuggly and fits well on our First Years Close and Secure Sleeper.Service and delivery product was great - came in the mail in a short period of time.I'm just disappointed that my fussy and borderline colicky baby showed no improvement when I put this on her tummy....still wailing and screaming at the top of her lungs (after trying it out on her more than once).Seems a bit gimmicky to me but I had to give this a try, too bad this did nothing for my little one!It's functional and serves its purpose but could use some improving.It seems a bit out dated for my taste, as if it was designed nearly 50 years ago.I liked that it would tell me the fetal development but when I purchase another pregnancy calendar I will not be getting this calendar.I ordered this with some trepidation.One, some negative reviews here, second the Amazon color is "brown" but I wanted espresso.Turns out Brown IS espresso.It took a quite a while to put it together, certain stages do require two people (just like it says in the manual.)The manual is not very clear, the parts are not labeled and certain steps are not explicitly called out, you sort of need to figure it out on your own.However, you'll be hard pressed to find a better table in this price point.Took me about 2 hrs to put everything together, it was quite a project.I managed to mess up a bolt accidentally, sent them an email, a replacement came in the mail in 2 days.Two things I wish they'd improve.1.The drawers when pulled from a side, end up a little skewed, you need to pull from the center.Otherwise, good product, real solid.We sat down and put it together in roughly an hour.I plan to make my own "pillow case" type covering for it with material that matches the baby's bedding.My 9-month daughter loved a friend's teether that looked similar to this.I bought it in a store, but it turns out that she can't get the teether nubs to her back teeth.The ball is too hard.We were at a BBQ and everyone was laughing at how disinterested she was in this toy.I should have waited and looked on Amazon for the same one.Now I'm buying the second teether.This was a waste.My nine month old has had Sophie since she was three months old.Not only has Sophie been a great teether since she is chewy, easy to grab, and has a lot of ends to chew on, my daughter has also found her to be a great comfort when she is in pain from teething or just upset.We squeak Sophie a few times and she never fails to deliver a smile!We never leave the house without her!We've noticed that slowly Sophie's food grade safe coloring is fading or coming off but she is made with 100% safe chemicals so we're not worried.I will be purchasing her as gifts for new moms and my own children in the future!-AdrienneWe keep her in our diaper bag and she goes everywhere with us.A word of caution: She does squeak like a dog toy!He is only three months old and I have NO idea what is so interesting about her but he can't get enough of her.Maybe it's the size, maybe it's the rubber smell, I am  not sure.I am giving it a 3 star because it is just sitting there and not being used.Thus, I am unable to give much review about the use of it.Very good quality rubber, and squeek when you squeeze it.Yes it does look like a dog's chew toy.Perhaps he is on the smaller side, only 20th percentile on weight.This toy is way too big for him to hold and put in his mouth.A little difficult to handle.When he first hold it (on one of the leg), he hit his head with the giraffe's head.It's difficult for him to aim it in his mouth, perhaps that's why he doesn't like it.I wish one day he will use it.For now it's just an expensive made in France chew toy sitting on the floor.I bought Sophie for my three month old and at the time it was hit or miss, sometimes he'd like it, others not so much, which is totally understandable since babies of that age don't do a whole lot anyway...But once he turned six months old, Sophie did not leave his little hands!My 18 month old niece can't seem to put her down either!But I'm not sure I'd pay almost $20 for this.It's a good product but a bit pricy for a teething toy.I was to get Sophie and Vulli Soft Toy CPG CHAN to compare but ended up getting only Sophie.I was afraid my baby would not like it.My baby loves sucking her hands so much.Sometimes she put two hooves at a time - it's so funny!!On one of our road trips, she munched on the hooves and fell asleep!!!!I was so amazed coz usually she doesn't nap easily.Anyway, hate the noise when her gum rups on Sophie.But it's something I can live with as long as my baby has a great time.We've been using this toy since 4 months of age.The legs aren't even that long and I can't see how a child can even get it lodged in their throats to the point of suffocating.We got this for my daughter when she was 3 months old.She likes to grab it by the neck as she goes to sleep which I think is great, it saves my finger, which is her usual sleep time routine.I was surprised when Sophie came in, that she is also a squeak toy, which presented a little bit of a problem with one of our dogs who is ga ga over squeakers...However, with some training she has learned to leave it alone.My daughter is now almost 5 months old and is teething like crazy... we do not leave our house without Sophie!Whenever she starts to get cranky she will chew on Sophie's legs and be content.I loved reading the story that comes with Sophie, about how this toy is made just as it was in 1956, in the same process from the same all natural materials (tree sap or natural rubber).I have tried dozens of teether toys with both my daughters, my 5 month old loves chewing on sophie's feet or head.if I give her one of the wooden teething toys she cries (too hard and big/heavy) and if I give her the plastic rings, she also cries (again I think too hard).Sophie is amazingly soft and seems very durable.I have not seen any fading of the colors at all.My baby girl is 4 months old and has been working on reaching for objects and is of course putting those objects in her mouth.I've been concerned about the weight of some of the toys and rattles she has.A lot of them are made of hard plastic that if they fell on her face it would hurt her.Sophie the giraffe is so soft and light that it isn't a worry at all.My baby loves Sophie, she chews safely (food-based paint) on her  and tucks her under her arm when she naps.She also likes to look at the contrast of spots on Sophie's body.I also like the way Sophie squeaks.It's a really soft sound, so that the baby is alerted by it, but not startled.I know it seems expensive for a baby toy, but it is really worth it.One of those well loved toys.I was sceptical at first but based on use, totally worth every penny.Angela likes the sound of this toy and likes to take it's top in her mouth.It's a very elegand looking and pleasant toy.She likes it more than her other teether toys I've got her from Babies RS.Only after days there are corners that looks like the colors are coming off due to friction?Expect to fade, its food paints after all.Surprise the rubber didn't turn me off.. Squeak sound is subtle, not noisy or rude, unlike some squeaky toys that startle my bb.I'm thinking of how it wont keep dropping on the floor..It really something very simple but i cant describe why babies might like them right at 1st sight.(could it be the smell?)Not cheap but worthy.Good friends you only need a few.;) tis makes a good friend for teething..Your baby's gonna drool at it!One of the mom's suggested Sophie, and as I looked around at least half the kids were chewing on a Sophie.I ordered one when I got home and my son LOVES it.There are soft areas and slightly harder areas to help soothe gums.We were given this toy for our daughter when she was about three months old.The legs are very soft, but still firm enough to help with a little one teething.Though Sophie has seen many hours of chewing she shows no signs of wearing out or coming apart.The only thing we have noticed is that the spots and hoof coloring did start to fade with chewing.This was the one toy our son just had to have all the time.We buy this for every friend who has a baby, truly the best teether we could find and it's totally safe too.I was worried that my baby would choke herself with the legs, but she hasn't... yet!I'm not usually this gullible, but based on the reviews and the fact that literally everybody with a baby seems to have one of these, I took the plunge and coughed up the outrageous amount of money for this glorified dog toy.My son is mildly interested in it, as a squeak toy, but the only reason it goes into his mouth is purely by coincidence.Everything ends up in his mouth eventually anyway.To add insult to injury, ours has a funny smell too.Maybe it's the smell of stupidity.I feel like a total fool for buying this.I will probably try to redeem my self respect by inventing the next stupid baby toy and using my newfound amazon wish list marketing tactics to become a gazillionaire.Take that Sophie!She rocks!Sophie is the first thing he reaches for in his toy basket.Sophie is easy for him to grab and hold onto by her long neck or legs, and she is really soft!I really like that Sophie is made of safe, non-toxic materials and is BPA-free.I am really glad I went ahead and bought Sophie....she's well worth the money for a great teething toy!There are a lot of soft areas to chew on.My boy prefers the feet and ears.Sophie was a great buy for my infant!I had read reviews saying she was 'over-priced' and 'just a glorified dog toy,' but I'm so glad I didn't listen to them.Yes, it squeaks like a dog toy, but that teaches your baby cause & effect!Just made me feel good that she liked it so much.Yes, it seems pricey, but I fully believe it was well worth the money.Better yet, our daughter just adores her!Sophie has now lost some of her paint due to the chewing and sucking that our baby has done but the rubber is nice and sturdy and there's no damage to the body.We regularly hear rubber creaking sounds when little Sophie is being mauled but she doesn't complain.I will be buying Sophie for all of our baby-producing friends and family!LOLMy baby has played with her giraffe since she was 3 months old.It's her favorite and she smiles whenever she sees or hears it.The long legs and neck are easy to grasp and the feet fit in her mouth.It's softer than the plastic toys out there and smells faintly sweet.My baby (now 5 months) does get tired of it after a while - it doesn't satisfy her sucking desires quite as much as her pacifier.Baby's other favorite toys right now are her pacifier and washcloths.Sophie is a great toy that can be used for a long time.She has different parts that are thick or thin, and my baby absolutely goes crazy for her nose.Her spots are fun to look at, and she has many limbs and a thin neck that can be grabbed by little hands.The squeak noise always makes him smile, but it's not so loud you can't use it in public!Some people complain about the rubber smell but it didn't bother me and it has noticeably lessened over time.Obviously  my baby didn't care because she was in his mouth without a second thought.Everyone loves this toy for a reason!Some teethers are too hard.This one is perfecr!We have other teethers that vibrate, are supposed to be chilled, or have other features that would seem to be more soothing, but she loves this one.I would have given this 5 stars if it were not for the following:1.It smelled strongly of rubber for quite some time2.Some of the paint on the ears and feet seems to have been chewed off.The description indicates that the paint is "food paint" so I'm hoping my daughter's consumption of this is not harmful.She is easy to clean and disenfect.Our baby likes to suck and gum the heck out of Sophie.At first when we got this toy I wondered why someone would send us a dog toy, but your baby just loves her.I tried wet & frozen washcloths, cold binkies, cold teething rings...he didn't hold or like any of them.It's soft to chew on & he can hold it.This is defintely our 6 month old baby's favorite toy.It was also the first toy that he showed any interest in.I probably should not have put it in the dishwasher, the squeaker sounds a little "strained" now.My 5-mos old son took to this immediately.The shape of the neck makes it easy to hold and the shape of the legs allows him to stick the feet toward the backs of his gums for sucking and chewing, easing discomfort from teething.(Only the Melissa and Doug bugs container seems to offer similar toys that reach back there with ease.Few toys have that extension and texture.)Especially in his car seat, he often falls asleep with the tip of a leg in his mouth.I was surprised that the toy is so soft and hollow; I'd expected a foam and not the "dog toy" texture.And sure enough, my dog LOVES this giraffe!Suddenly "squeak squeak squeak" could be heard from across the house.Our darling mutt schemed to wait til we left to grab the giraffe and race off with his prize.I suppose that's a downside, but we just clean it with soap and hot water or stick it in the dishwasher and we're good to go.It is very soft, I expected it to be firmer, which is great for the baby to sink her teeth into.Also, it makes a squeaking sound when you squeeze in the middle, which I did not know it made.Just the right size for my 4mo old to gum...has been for past two months...but he doesn't pay it any attention.Also, the dog is so attracted to the squeak that it is more likely to become the dogs toy if my baby doesn't start to pay it attention!He will extend his arm and smack it on the ground back and forth.He likes to put it under his knee and squeak it when he is sitting in his bouncer.This is his buddy when we travel and he will kick it in his car seat....I just saw other baby's happily mawing it everywhere we went.I'd come across Sophie during my pre-baby hunt for usable items and this rated well, but I wasn't 100% convinced.Then I noticed babies happily gnawing on it many places we went and decided to order one.Once I had it, a gal in my parenting support group mentioned it was on Oprah, etc.That didn't matter to me at all because my little guy loves mashing his gums of the giraffe's feet and face.I do see the paint slowly wearing away, but it's food grade dye, so I'm not worried about it.I don't think my little one cares about the visual appeal of the giraffe, except for the creepy black eyes.Those eyes are on nearly ALL his toys and he loves staring at them.Overall, if your baby loves to chew and maw this is a good teether.He chews and gnaws on her constantly, her legs can be used to reach the gums further back in his mouth, her ears work great on the front.He smiles every time I hand her to him.She stays in his carseat when we're home just to make sure that she's in the car with us when we leave.It seems to be the favorite at playgroups too.I think its the high contrast dots that first catches their eyes.Then its the squeker that gets them too.Sophie is made of natural rubber Latex and my daughter, who is very allergic to Latex, broke out in hives.Again, great teether and my girlfriends think so too.But if you have an allergic child, this is not the teether for you.It's well made and cleans easily.I know it's a lot of money, but we aren't sorry we bought it!I was a pretty steep price for a teether but she really loved to stare this giraffe in the face and gnaw on her feet.So far, she hasn't gotten tired of it, but she didn't express any interest in it whatsoever until she started teething, so I would hold off on it until then.My baby enjoys this toy but the LOUD squeak has woken him up when he squirms around in his crib during naps.Not our top favorite--the vulli vanilla teething rings are better.She doesn't bite it hard enough or squeeze it for the squeaker but she will chew on her legs and ears for a little while.If I would have known what I know now..I probably would have saved my money!I know, I know, I know... it's a chew toy.A giraffe... and kindof a weird-looking giraffe.Why all the hype?Why all the money?Because it's a great toy and babies love it.Those gimpy legs and that long neck?Heaven!I had nursed some reservations about the latex in this toy as I, myself, am allergic to latex, but it has been fine.No problems whatsoever.Hooray for Sophie!He will be 4 months old in a week.They did not, however, favor it over other toys to chew and therefore it was not worth the price.I did like the smell, though; it reminded me of toys when I was a kid.Sophie is a hit in our house.Even my 2yr old has noticed how much the baby loves this teether!Very chewable, soft and washable I'm a fan even at this price point!We received this as a gift for my second child, but I can't imagine ever paying $20 for a stupid teether.There is nothing special about it whatsoever.I really don't understand what the hype is all about.It is soft, and cute and it squeaks, but there are other teethers that are soft and squeak.My son had no interest in it - he preferred chewing on his blankie or basically any teether we gave him.I gave Sophie to a friend and I don't think her daughter cared for it either.Save your money and just buy something else.Also, while my child never choked on the legs, I can see how that would be possible.this thing is great!my 5 month old gnaws on it for hours and loves the squeeking!some reviewers say it's a glorified dog toy...maybe so, but with the food safe paint for my babe to chew on compared to a dog toy...i'll pay the extra bucks and get the safest thing for him to have in his mouth.love this toy!It squeaks when you squeeze it so it functions as a basic toy as well as a teether with contrasting surfaces for sensitive gums without being too hard or too soft.Its bigger than I thought it would be but now that I think about it, this is probably a good thing because it will be easier for her to hold onto the giraffe and harder to lose.The only thing I'm not crazy about is the initial smell, which I'm hoping will fade in time.The reviews for this products were very positive and its been on the market for a long time so I've got a lot of faith that this will be a good teether and toy for my daughter.In ordering from Amazon, Sophie the Giraffe arrived within a week, in clean original packaging and in perfect condition so I have no complaints about that.I know its available from other retailers (I believe she's sold at Babies R Us too) but I ordered through Amazon because I was ordering other products for the nursery that were not available anywhere else and figured Amazon would be more reliable for such a popular product- guess I was right!Easy to clean, gender-neutral and the babies really do love it!My daughter will be 2 in October and she still occasionally plays with Sophie- its a great travel/car toy!I saw many reviews and I thought, what a great idea for a teether.The great thing it is not hard plastic (it is much like a squeaky dog toy) soft.Most moms stop me and want to know where I got it as well.Which is great as he's becoming his own little person and wants to hold things himself.He can chew on the head, legs and feet.Yes, I am essentially writing a love letter to a rubber squeaky Giraffe.Sophie is one of those things.I am a new mom, and one of those people that has to read every review and weight out all of the pros and cons, so I knew what to expect from Sophie before we received her.The Cons:She is basically a dog toy.Some people were concerned she might be a choking hazard(?I am so glad we did.The first day I took you out of the box and washed you(keeping a finger over the squeaker!Sturdy, durable, slightly textured, soft rubber.You are BPA, PVC, and Phthalate free.Your rubber smell was definitely noticeable, but it wasn't a bad smell, its kind of sweet.I showed you to my three month old, and gave you a squeak.His face lit up with immediate interest.His other teething toys are heavy, hard to hold onto, and frustrating because he can't get them all the way into his mouth for a really satisfying chew.My son can chew on your soft legs and head for hours without hurting his sensitive little gums.He easily passes you from hand to hand, and actively works to pick you up once he has droped you.You are also the only toy he can squeak on his own, making you even more appealing.When my son is given a choice between toys you win out every time, and are never more than a few feet away.a level ten melt down has been avoided by your sudden appearance and friendly squeak.In fact we just purchased a back up so you can be at home and in the diaper bag, because we would be in trouble if we lost you.Although I don't regret buying Sophie, she's overpriced and my daughter preferred the other Vulli teethers to Sophie.I think Sophie might be cuter and more acceptable looking, but the other ones are built better than Sophie.I give one to all my new mommy friends now!This toy is good teether and it make a funny sound.We introduced it to our baby at 2 month and till now (8.5 month) she still laugh when she see it and bite it too.I mean, really, isn't it just a teether.I was convinced by the lack of chemicals (BPA-free) .I am currently pregnant and got it for the baby.However, my 2 year old happens to think it is the best thing ever.I have no idea why.Taste??Smell??It really is a toy that your baby will love.I have no idea why, but as long as it can entertain and soothe, I am not going to question it.I have already sent 1 to a friend as well (which I guess makes 3 orders), because it really is THAT good.It's funny to watch her with this because she'll grab the head and shove it into her mouth and then spits it out.And I like knowing that she is safe for my kid to slobber all over.The only thing I don't like is the hole in Sophie back which allows air in and out to produce the squeeking sound.When I washed Sophie the first time, water got inside her.After the first time, I've been really careful to put my finger over the hole when washing.It makes it more cumbersome, but better than mold.My daughter thought it was cute and nibbled on it maybe a total of 4 times during her entire time of teething.She really didn't go crazy for it like some kids do and she chews on EVERYTHING!Now she's 18 months and just loves to squeeze Sophie to get her to squeek.Cute product though.I purchased this toy after reading all the rave reviews about it.I wasn't sure if the toy would live up to it's hype, but it does!My baby is 5 weeks old, and she took immediate interest in it, and even smiled and cooed at Sophie.Up until now, she hadn't taken much interest in any of her other toys.The toy itself is well made.I know a couple people said that Sophie has a bad rubber odor, but I didn't find it to be unpleasant, and I'm usually pretty fussy when it comes to odd smells.I'm glad I bought this, and will probably be buying more as gifts.I thought she was a waste of money, but boy was I wrong.As soon as he figured out he could stick her in his mouth she's been his only toy.He prefers her over a pacifier.The squeek keeps him interested while the texture sooths his teething gums.Easy to clean and fun to play with.We hesitated buying this because it looked and sounded more like a dog toy than a teether and was expensive compared to other available teething toys, but am so thankful that we did!Sophie has been well worth the money and we appreciate this teether so much that it will become a standard gift for all the new mothers for whom we purchase gifts.We definitely don't want her to get lost on trips or errands.For about a month (month 6) this was his favorite chew toy.There's no denying that there's something about the material that attracts infants.It's just a shame that it didn't last very long at all.If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably buy the CPG CHAN which looks striking similar to a nipple.I'm not about to shell another ~$15 on a rubber chew toy that probably costs a fraction of the amount to produce.If you accidentally get some water in the squeaker it's very hard to dry out fully which makes it rather unsanitary.Secondly, I found the odor of the toy to be a little more petroleum like than I would like.My son never got sick or anything but it was hard to ignore the scent of the toy.I bought this for my neice and i have to say this lil toy makes her sooooo happy.Sophie is a fantastic teether toy, my son loves giraffes to begin with so imagine when I found this teether I had to get it for him.The only thing is DO NOT try to microwave sterilize this as I did.I chock it up to first time mom stupidity...It ruins the squeezing mechanism that produces the little squeak sound when you squeeze it.I don't think the baby cares, as he still chews on it all the time and loves talking to it too!Still probably a nice "toy-ish" feature that I ruined.As tempting as it is to replace, there is nothing wrong with the teether other then the sound so I am stuck with.Just don't do it for yourself so that the baby might enjoy the noise maker as well.Now it's one of his favorite toys & keeps his interest for long periods of time.Doesn't really care about the squeaky option, but loves chewing on it (will come in handy when he starts teething).Wish I had looked at it in person first - it really is nothing more than an organically-sourced dog toy.The thing even smells like a dog toy, not something I would want in my mouth, let alone my daughter's.The squeaker is loud, not soothing at all, and the "skin" has an unpleasant texture, like the inside of a powdered latex glove.We take Sophie for every car ride.. she is the only actual teether that my son will gnaw on!We lost a Sophie in the mall and had to order a replacement!baby likes it a lot.I am not worried about the dye because I think they said it is food grade dye.It is really cute too.I would get another for my next baby if this one is worn out.Yes my daughter likes it somewhat but she is not IN LOVE.Doesn't like it enough to justify $20 on a chew toy.I say chew toy because I've had several people tell me they thought it looked like a dog toy.Waaaaaaaaay overpriced.Sophie is utterly addictive for my 4month old.He chews it, swings it around, makes it squeak, stares at it - it keeps him occupied for a good long time.This product is great for my 4-month old son to chew on.He can grasp it and hold it for a while.The legs are pretty long so I have to be staring at him the entire time he plays with it- otherwise he'll gag.I mean literally staring at him while he chews on it!Also- if you have dogs beware- the giraffe squeaks just like a dog toy and my dogs go nuts!(We kept the dog away from it, though.)His other teethers weren't long enough to massage the back gums, they really just reached the front.Looking at Sophie I never really understood what all the craze was about....she is just a plastic giraffe.Then I gave it to my four month old son.Plus she's big enough that if he drops her he can usually find her again.My son likes this teething toy.This is very durable.My little guy had 8 teeth by the time he was 7 months and has gnawed on this thing like you wouldn't believe.The legs of the giraffe allow little ones to localize teething more efficiently.She has a lot of teethers but this is the ONE!My baby looooves this teether!We got another one when our second child was born and it's a winner.It's durable and easy to clean and it keeps her entertained for a little while.She'll chew on the feet and legs and really bite down.I'll squeeze the toy and she'll look at me and then start to chew again.A quality product.We got these when my girls were 18 months old, Zoey being very independant and not wanting to hold our hands or be put in the cart most of the time & Madison being very high spirited and wanting to run all over the place.We were tired of walking through the store with screaming kids in the cart or having to hold 2 screaming kids who only wanted down(they didn't do that all the time but it wasn't fun)My girls LOVE Curious George and monkeys so they were all about putting on their monkey backpacks.At first we just put them on in our house and kept the "tail" tied up and they loved their monkeys, always wanted to wear them.Like we were shopping for a new computer in the store and it was taking quite a while so my girls kept wanting to get into EVERYTHING and were getting quite grouchy.So while my husband waited I took both my girls "tails" and we walked around the store.Had I not had these monkeys, I never would have been able to walk around with both girls because they are too heavy for me to carry for more than a few minutes and if they get their hands free from me they will normally run in different directions.But my girls were happy being able to walk all around the store...now since my girls were getting used to them and are still pretty young, they DID get the tails tangled around me and themselves on a regular basis but that is hardly a problem and easily remedied.Plus it gives everyone else in the store something to laugh at ;) and let me tell you, we got a lot of attention.Some people just stare, some people laugh, you get the "how cute, how funny, what a great idea, where did you get that" comments.And also the people who remember the toddler leashes their parents used to use on them...the ones that velcro'd around the wrist and had the stretchy old phone cord connecty wire thingy, 2 guys were cracking up talking about their childhood memories.These are WAY better than kid leashes used to be.These are just a simple monkey backpack leash.They are soft and comfy.We keep these in the van at all times and use them in the appropriate situations, very handy.Let me know if you have any questions and I will do my best to answer them for you :)We purchased two of these bags for use in our diaper pail.After being washed twice one of the bags started leaking through the PUL (as if the PUL was permeable).I now notice that the second bag is doing the same.I would not recommend these bags since they don't do what they are supposed to.I have not used this product yet, but it seems very soft and likely to be very absorbent.It looks way too big to fit my seven pound newborn, I haven't even tried.I purchased this tub for my new little one and was seriously disappointed.Just as with other reviews, the pump is loud, too many batteries, and the tube for the shower nozzle is ridiculously coiled in a way that keeps the water from properly flowing through.Also, it only pumps water that is in the actual water container, not from the bath tub itself.Therefore, you run out of water to pump quickly - it is not a continuously circulating pump.However, once the baby starts to sit up, you can no longer use it, plus, the tub is not necessarily suitable for longer babies.We only used the pump maybe twice and then we decided to get a new tub.I think for $30 we were expecting something a bit nicer.I would save your money and look into something else.I would not recommend this tub to anyone.After a lot of research into safe products for babies to mouth I purchased this teether because it is apparently BPA, PVC and Phthalate Free according to "The ZRecs Guide to Safer Children's Products".She really enjoys it.I have the Isis Duo electric pump, which has the parts to make one of the heads manual, which is so convenient.However, the pump kit comes with only one of these stemmed diaphrams, however I pump twice a day at work using the manual attachment and dont want to wash it so I needed more.They are impossible to find in stores.I can't seem to get this to fit on my tub at all so it has been totally useless.If you don't have a standard shape spout, I don't know if this will work.This is a cute idea, but the execution and overall usefulness leave much to be desired.My daughter purchased this when her son was transitioning from his infant bathtub to an inflatible tub that would fit in the regular bathtub.She thought this shower spray would help with the bathing process and that it was cute.Thus, whenever she has guests the Sassy Shower Spray must be removed from the faucet or the pressure from the main shower head would blow it off the faucet and cause damage to the Sassy.Additionally, there is the question of durability since the Sassy must be removed and put back onto the faucet repeatedly.It is plastic and does not feel particularly sturdy.I would suggest purchasing one of the hand-held shower heads on Amazon rather than the Sassy Shower Spray.Those products are of higher quality construction, do not require removal for someone other than the baby or child's usage, and provide greater value for the consumer.However, if your infant or small child is the only person using a particular bathtub or if you need something to fill an Amazon order so that you get free shipping, this might be something you consider.Otherwise, there are much better products on the market.He loves to hug this little guy when I rock him and when he's in his crib.It attaches easily to his crib, stroller, and car seat so he can hear it wherever he goes, and it actually surprised me how loud the sound machine can get.Not loud enough to hurt his ears, but loud enough to drown out most noises at the mall, and just some general noises that would otherwise inhibit sleep.Without the Sleep Sheep, the first 8 weeks would have been exceptionally more difficult.The beauty of this product is that it produces white noise that helps the baby soothe back to sleep.There are 4 different types of white noise from which to choose.I highly recommend this product; in fact, I buy it for all my friends who are having babies.The larger sheep is designed to sit on or near the baby's crib.The smaller one has a handy velcro strap that attaches very nicely to carseat handles, crib slats, swing bars, or even just acts as a handle for Mom and Dad to carry it around.It usually took less than 5 minutes to get him calmed down again.In one particular instance, the Sleep Sheep was a real lifesaver.I had to go back to the doctor for my post-C-Section checkup, and I had to take my baby with me.I got stuck waiting in the exam room for about an hour, and 20 minutes in, my son woke up.I turned the Sleep Sheep on (which was fastened to his car seat handle), and he was calmed down and back to sleep within just a few minutes.I really cannot emphasize enough how great this product (when used in conjunction with swaddling) is for newborn babies.As anyone can tell you, the first 8 weeks are the hardest, so do yourself a favor and get this product - it's not that expensive, but it will help you a lot!They sent it to me free of charge within three days.Now my daughter's favorite sleeping device is back in working condition.We have the big one at home on the crib & this one for travel (attaches to the pack-n-play, bouncer chair, etc).Very soothing for the little guy - especially when trying to get him to fall asleep in unfamiliar places.The heartbeat sound on the original size is not available on the "on to go" size...but my favorites are the ocean & whale (mostly bc I don't mind listening to it through the monitor when I'm trying to fall asleep too).A few things...-There is a timer on it that shuts its off after about 1/2 hour or an hour.This could be a downside if your baby needs it continously playing...my little guy only needs it to fall asleep.It was nice to have such a PORTABLE sound machine so that we could place it in his pack and play when he was napping somewhere other than home.I only have three complaints, all of which could be easily remedied by a few small product design changes -1) There is not option to keep the sounds playing continually.This would REALLY improve the products overall effect.When you are using the sheep to drown out outside noises so baby can nap, you need the product to stay on until you turn it off, not shut off on a timer.2) When the sounds finishes, it simply shuts off abruptly, rather than fading down slowly.So far we have had no problems with it.We use it fairly regularly on the 45 minute setting and have not had to replace the batteries yet.I find the volume goes as loud as I want it to go and rarely use it turned all the way up.I also find that I don't need more than 45 minutes of the white noise so the fact that it lacks a continuous mode doesn't bother me.Although I don't think we'll ever use it for that as it serves a much better purpose as a white noise machine in a very cute stuffed sheep body.This is a great idea and I'm sure a mom who was also a rock climber came up with it, because that's exactly what it is with just a little extra padding.But the price is right and it is cool to have, especially using it on a grocery cart to hang your diaper bag/purse.Hanging stuff off of a stroller is trickier because if your diaper bag has a long strap (as mine does), you tend to kick it.I stick to keeping it in the diaper bag and using at the grocery store and I really like it for that purpose.I love my Mommy Hook.I use it to hook shopping bags to my stroller and when I get home, I just carry all the bags conveniently with the Mommy Hook.It's just nice and handy to have around.Sometimes I have a bag that I want to attach to my diaper bag, and the hook comes in handy then too.I'm not sure what other reviews are talking about when they say it's flimsy or cheap, but mine was pretty sturdy and I haven't had any problems with it.Exactly what i wanted to hang my diaper bag from!Easy to use and durable.Cannot go wrong with this one!Just for 8 dollars your life gets a lot easier.Don't overload it though.It was fairly easy to put together (the only thing that gave me any problem was that the right and left sides were labeled backward for the arm rests).The cushions are just as thick as they look and very comfortable.I am 5'3" and 155 at 9 months pregnant and I fit in it well.It is a bit more narrow in the seat than some that I sat in but not by much.The only negative is that there is a 'greasy' sound coming from somewhere under the chair.I am sure it is something that will work itself out or maybe I could wipe away some of the joint lubrication and it would fix it, I just haven't yet.Overall, I highly recommend this chair, especially from Amazon.We've had problems with the locking mechanism on the chair, but the company got us replacement parts pretty easily, so I definitely would recommend it.Wish I had invented it.I'm currently ordering a second one after losing our first one mid-trip, which made the trip home much harder without it.Just in case I need an extra hand I can just hook up the child and it allows me to bring the car seat with me.It is heavy but secured easily to our crib.Our daughter seems to like it, she is 7 months but can't crawl yet.The volume is just fine even on the lower setting for us.Our daughter isn't around a lot of loud tv or anything anyway.I love the music, it is so clear, it sounds great, all of the settings are soothing, not too fast.I have not seen any other reviewers say this, so I am hoping we got a defective one but our mobile has one big leaf that sticks and delays coming down, and when it does it makes a fairly loud clunking noise which sometimes startles our baby.I don't think we could possibly use this mobile to help her sleep... or a future younger baby sleep.We plan on exchanging it and if our new one clunks I am not sure what we will get.So we searched for a longer-lasting, remote-controlled one.This mobile is cute, albeit it doesn't match his room decor, and it is bright and engaging.Our 4 1/2 mo old loves to watch the leaves (they go up and down around the animals as they rotate).It was easy to install and I like the fact that it uses D batteries, so hopefully they last quite awhile.I have a few minor caveats: The remote doesn't work from too far away; the sensor on the main body has to be visible to the sensor on the remote (no operating from behind the door or around the corner).Though it is calming and classical and largely not annoying, it is midi music, and I wish it were real symphonic music.At this point, baby doesn't seem to mind but it does bother me a bit.Lastly, I wish the music would fade instead of turning off at the timer.Sometimes if he is almost asleep the abrupt change in sound will cause him to stir or wake up.There are two volumes but neither are very loud, which is not necessarily a bad thing.This product is easy to install and fits on our crib which has a rather large railing.It is a little quiet but it's for helping a baby relax and sleep so it really shouldn't be that loud.Read the reviews and decided to buy this.From the moment I put it up and turned it on he has loved it.It's great because I can put him in his crib and he is fascinated with it for about and hour, giving me time to do some things around the house.It was also pivotal in getting him used to/comfortable with his crib.Also note, the music isn't annoying at all.However, I wish it stayed on longer than 30 minutes and that the remote did not deactivate after an hour.Otherwise a great buy.My baby was early and at the Children's Hospital, they use these in the nursery.Baby stares at it, on and off.He loves the music, which puts him to sleep every time.Diaper changes are easier with the mobile too.The hospital recommends it, I recommend it.SUCH A GREAT BUY!There is a plastic lip on the upper back side of the mobile that is supposed to rest on the top of your crib rail - no problem so far - but there is also a lower lip a few inches down.If your rail doesn't fit between these two lips, you can still tighten the clamp, but the mobile won't lay flat against the crib, and it could easily be bumped and fall on the baby and/or scratch the crib.The music is not grating, static-y, or tinny sounding like so many baby products.Hopefully, I can find a similar one that attaches differently.Also the battery life is decent, in use every night & 2 naps a set of batteries would last 4-6 months.A simple heartbeat generator w/ no motion or light soothes him best, so I would say no matter how great the product is know your child & what works for them.[BTW the 3yr old still loves it & doesn't understand why it upsets her brother!]We used any combination of the three songs whenever he would go down for a nap during the day and the 'Rainforest' sounds whenever we put him to bed for the night.Just one more thing we did to help him differentiate night time from nap time.We ended up barely ever using the remote as most of the time our son would fall asleep before the time limit on the music would end but it was nice to have at the beginning when he would occasionally take longer to get to sleep.Even though he stands up in his crib now and pushes the button on/off this is still securely fastened enough that we don't worry about him getting it off his crib.There was a period (when he was 2-3 months old) when he would stop crying and kick excitedly whenever we placed him in his crib and turned the mobile on.We replaced the batteries several times (which did not fix the problem), and decided to put up with the whirring noise and the slowness.It finally stopped turning at all after 6 months.I disassembled it, and found that it was cheap plastic construction, which relies on a thin rubber band to rotate the whole assembly.I cleaned the plasticky gunk from the belt-wheel (another plastic piece), but shortly after being reassembled, the mobile slowed down again.It's going in the trash.By watching us turn it on, he's learned how it works, too!He's been turning it on since he was a little over 4 months old.He either plays with it using his feet (almost like he's trying to get the animals!)or pushes the button with his hand & just stares at it.I'd love if the music/lights/movement option lasted longer than 3 songs.I find that on rougher nights, we have to go in & turn it on 1 or 2 additional times before he'll be asleep.It does have a music only option that plays for 18mins but he really likes to watch the lights/movement as well.All-in-all, I'd definitely ask for/buy this again if I had it to do over ^_^My daughter loves this toy, and the rainforest sounds (we keep it just to that without the music) are really soothing.It was the first toy to hold her attention (at about 5 weeks).The one thing I'd change is the timer - it only runs for about 5-8 minutes -- that's WAY too short when she's having trouble falling back asleep.I did not purchase this toys originally.Our neighbors had the Precious Planet Melodies and Motion soother and every time we went to visit, our daughter could not stop playing with and looking at this toy.I subsequently found the Rainforest Waterfall Peek-A-Boo Soother at a second-hand shop and purchased it.My daughter loves this thing!!!!She will stare at it, watching and listening intently for a long period of time, which is more than I can say for most of her toys.Our musical mobile worked great when she was younger, but now that she is 9 months old, this soother really holds her attention much longer.Excellent, quality product - a must have for the crib!What baby wouldn't like to look at this - especially during tummy time!Even my older kids like to play with this.It has held up for four years so its pretty durable.I use it every night since I nurse.I went to tend my baby when he was fussing and turned it on to help soothe him--the light was so bright in a darkened room that it just blasted his eyes and made his fussiness 10 times worse.No good.We now keep it hanging with his other toys.He loves to be held and be around me so yes that is the longest he will stay busy without someone in the room.Definitely catches my 5 month old son's attention and keeps him enthralled for several minutes, though he looses interest, he will look around then come back to it, but generally it just doesn't last as long, which is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.Otherwise its a great buy for your baby.The lights are a bit bright but never seem to bother my child.Wonderful product.Contrary to my review on the Sweet Pea Snuggle Pod Travel Toy (the arch), I love this one.The toy is very well made and is just so adorable!She ended up being sick so I gave it to her early.The first thing she did was give it a big hug and snuggle up with it!This doll is super cute.It is just the right size for her to hold and hug, definitely a favorite for her.I got this for my friend's 15 month old daughter for Christmas this year.No, it doesn't have feet, but it looks like a baby who is in a sleeping gown.It's very cute and soft, and has little ribbon tag on top of the pea pod and an orange ribbon tag on top of the head, like hair.The bottom of the pea pod has a little squiggly fabric-covered elastic thing.I can see younger children liking those features to chew on and touch.Honestly, my daughter prefers her stuffed animals to this doll, but she does carry it around once in a while and I have seen her hug it.It's a great toy if your child likes dolls!Very cute doll, but almost as soon as we got it home I noticed there was a little hole under the doll's arm that was leaking stuffing.Also, baby isn't interested in it!Disappointed--this company's toys usually seem to have very good workmanship.The quality is wonderful- very soft.I hope that she will play with this later on.update: she just turned 10 months and has played with the doll a little bit- she likes to point out the nose....  *maybe there is hope* :)  I purchased the baby stella doll for her bday so lets hope that dolls are in by then lolMy grandaughter called her baby Peapod during her whole pregancy.I had to buy this cute doll for my great grandaughter seeing her Mommmy was taken by the concept of it all.It is well made and so cute!Just a side note- the doll does not have legs- it is more like the peanut shape (like it has a bunting suit on).I very highly recommend it- you will not be disappointed!!But the functionality is an issue.I imagine that the pee guard for boys needs to be movable for safety, but it is hard for my short-legged 22 month old to deal with.It often gets pushed down as he tries to sit by himself- and although I can lift him up and onto the toilet, what's the point of not giving him independence?And then when he does try to get on himself, the guard pushes down, and he knows it is supposed to be up and tries to put it in place.This has a lot of cute ideas, but it just doesn't work well when it comes down to it.He just loves sitting in it and looking up at us and we have a great place to put him down when we need to again.The big eyes on the lizard and fly really attract him and he loves to bat at them.And I like that the toy bar swings out of the way rather than me having to take it completely off and put it back on all the time, it makes my life a lot easier.She is currently 2 months old and doesn't like to sleep flat on her back on her bassinet.She has been sleeping on this chair since she was 3 weeks old!!!I love the fact that it's portable.We take it downstairs during the day and into our bedroom at night!!!!This is one of those "must have" baby products.I have been using it since she was 2 months old.The recline is perfect and baby stays happy for long time and even falls asleep in it.I wanted to use these to keep my 2 and a half year old from constantly making a mess out of our dvd collection.If your going to buy this MAKE SURE that the inside of your cabinet has a completely flat roof.We used them in the house we rented so we wouldn't damage the wood cabinets in the house and when we bought our own house we once again used them because our 62 year old cabinets really don't accommodate the other kind.We did have a house guest break one once though by insisting the cabinet open regardless of how much it didn't want to open.Can you tell we have our first child?To summarize, I will say that they are OK, but they come with a host of drawbacks, especially if you plan to use them for anything other than basic cabinets.As you can see, they are not cheap, which makes the price/value relationship unfavorable.For this price per lock, one would expect an exceptional product, and that is not what I got.Here are the drawbacks that I experienced with the locks:1.Not Versatile on Cabinets: We have a lower corner cabinet with shelves that spin around like a lazy Susan.The cabinet door on this cabinet is a hinged 2-part door held shut by a magnet.I tried using this lock on this cabinet door, and there was simply no way to make it work effectively.In addition, we have some oversized cabinet doors, such as a pantry cabinet door that is roughly 4 feet tall and 2 feet wide.This lock only works at the top of the door.Need to Test Frequently to Ensure Locking: I have closed cabinet doors many times expecting that the lock engaged when I closed the door.However, when I pulled on the door, it swung wide open.I then closed the door again, and the lock engaged.This kind of "hit or miss" reliability is not what I was expecting with these locks.3.Doesn't Work on Most Drawers: I read on another website and in some reviews that people used these for drawer locks, as well, not just cabinet locks.I found that these work on only a few drawers in the house (literally about 10% of our drawers).It is very difficult to explain in words, but they are simply not designed in such a way that the lock and latch will engage properly in most drawers in our home.I even tried these on dressers to keep drawers locked, and I got very mixed results, even within a single dresser.One drawer would properly lock, and the next would not, without any apparent explanation for the variable performance of the locks.4.It landed with the adhesive down in the bottom of a cabinet.It was nearly impossible to pull off the cabinet bottom, even a split second after it landed.When I did get it removed, the foam tape adhesive was destroyed, and I needed to spend a great deal of time removing the foam tape residue left behind.5.Adhesive Strength Questionable: One of the selling points of these locks is that you do not need to drill holes in your cabinets or use screws to install them.Our little boy is just about 24 pounds, and he is very strong.I say this because I can feel the movement of the lock when I tug on a cabinet door just a bit.I wish I could recommend a better product, but I have not found one yet.I had no problems with installation and my kids were not able to get into the cabinets.I recommend them!Okay, people.I see alot of people do not know how to screw the top onto this sippy cup so that it lines up with the handles.I promise you it is VERY EASY!The nipple that comes out of the collar (just like a bottle nipple comes out of the bottle collar), the collar, and the cup.#1 Take the nipple and insert it into the collar.There are 2 little "nubs" on top of the collar and 2 little "vents" on top of the nipple.Simply line up the vents on the nipple to the "nubs" ON TOP of the collar, pull thru, and wha-la!It screws on right 99.9% of the time!Easy as pie, I promise!Now the "nubs" on top of the collar are not to be confused with the colored dots inside the collar.#2 Screw on the top tightly.#3 Give to baby!I know it can be frustrating when you can't get things to work right.I'll try to add a video review if I can get the cup away from my baby!LOL!My husband installed them so I have no comments on that but I do know that I love these.I thought that they would have been annoying to live with but as it turns out, I've gotten used to having them (it took a few days).I so i bought a bunch of them to put on every cabinet and drawer in the house.i don't regret buying it at all.They've made my life much easier and I don't have to keep telling my little one no every time a door handle is touched.I installed these onto our cabinets myself.And you know how annoying it is when you're busy in the kitchen and one darn cabinet doesn't open or close smoothly.Frustrating.My kid yanks on the cabinets quite forcefully but so far, these latches haven't come loose.Will buy more to install on our drawers as he's taken an interest to drawers now.He is constantly pulling them off.. and every time my daughter tries to break into the cabinets they lock in an open position (only about an inch open but its still a pain to go back and shut them).The fact that they lock in an open position is a good but annoying feature :-) it stops her from slamming her fingers when she is upset that she can not get into the cabinet!It is horrible looking to have all of your drawers open like 2" or 3" all of the time (my baby is 15 months, no teaching him to stop yet...although we are working on it).:-(UPDATEI wrote this review a few months ago and have decided to throw these away.It would almost be worth him pinching his finger once or twice to learn on his own, "drawers hurt".A total waste of money and mine time installing them.I'm going back to the magnetic tot-locks, despite their frustrating installation.I installed this on our pantry door over a year ago using the adhesive that came with it.My almost 2.5 year old still has not defeated it and it is still stuck firmly to the door despite opening and closing the door numerous times each day.I actually came here to buy another one to use on our front door now that my daughter has learned how to unlock outside doors.I was very surprised to see so many negative reviews.We have other child locks on other doors and they don't work as well as this one.I do have to be careful to make sure the lock re-engages when I close the door and my daughter rarely hangs on this door handle, but it has never failed us yet.Update:  We've had this installed for about 2 years now and we've had no problems with them.The materials used to make these attractive bowls stinks!When I washed the first bowl I thought it was a fluke and even tried to scrape of the stuff (didn't work).Then I realized it happened with all three bowls.I've thrown them away because now they're ugly!She could pull the suction cups loose by the second day.They're still handy though as storage.Can't say I'm impressed by the lids either.They're too hard to get on.No matter what we tried, we could not get these bowls to stick or stay stuck.These bowls were a complete waste of money.They do work as regular bowls, of course, and I like that they have lids, so I did give them one star.But because they are advertised as "stay put suction" bowls...they only get that one star.Like many other reviewers, I found the suction to be mediocre on these.I bought 2 sets and some of them stick really well and don't come off at all and others don't suction at all, even with a little water on the bottom.Fortunately, my toddler is starting to get over the 'let's pick up the bowl and dump everything on the floor' phase so the suction thing doesn't bother me as much anymore.However, the lids are really hard to use.They are really ill-fitting and it takes a lot of time and effort to get them to snap on.Who's got time to mess with lids with a young toddler running around?So, if you don't need lids much or suction, then these bowls are nice and deep and the variety of sizes available is very handy (although that would sort of defeat the purpose of buying these, right?I totally recommend this bowls, they are colourfull and stay put to the table.I want more!Some of the older reviews are for the old style of bowl-- there were 3 bowls with one removable suction bottom-- they weren't so great.I'm back to buy a second set.I moisten the bottom with a bit of water, push down onto the dining room table, and the bowls stay there until I pull them up.The set comes with 3 different sizes; the smallest is perfect for one scrambled egg or a handful of blueberries, while the largest holds a dinner sized portion of pasta.They're perfect for preschool!I have a few other types of bowls, but for my toddler, these are definitely the ones I reach for.I have the new style and they don't stick well to any of our surfaces (2 different trays, kitchen table, coffee table, kid table...).We tried a bit of water, a bit of oil, a bit of spit--no luck.This was before we put them in the dishwasher, so that is not the problem.I wanted some suction bowls to help him to learn to self feed.He is doing great, but gets frustrated when bowls move around when he tries to scoop his oatmeal.These not only popped off when he was trying to use his spoon to scoop the food, but then they flipped over because of the rubbery suction instead of just sliding like other bowls.Not fun for mommy!Back to looking for a good suction bowl!These bowls are super cute and I love the lids that come with them.Honestly, I turned around for 2 seconds and he had it off, so it wasn't like he was working on it for awhile.They work a little better on the high chair.If you are expecting them to hold when a toddler grabs them, they won't.If you just want them to help keep the bowl still for toddlers trying to master using utensils, then they are great.The bowls are durable and handy.They don't stick for very long, but then again, none of them do!These solved that problem!But the big one can be a pain to get up, luckily there is a little rubber grip that sticks up, just enough to grab and break the suction.The lids are pointless and I can never get them to stay put but it's not a big dealThis is AMAZINGLY soft.I don't know whether it really matters to the baby, but it sure seems a nicer place to rest a naked bum than on the rough terrycloth I've seen on other covers!If you plan on using the straps, know that the openings in this cover are very close to the middle -- only about 6" apart.It's workable -- you can extend the straps to a longer length, thread them through the holes in the cover, then double back out under the baby in order to then reach around to cross over the baby -- but seems like poorly-planned design to me.So if you don't plan on using the straps at all, no issues.I would highly recommend this product.I only purchased one in celery, but I am going to purchase more!we have a flat changing pad that came with our furniture.This fits well, is very soft and stands up well to the washer/dryer.This bag has many compartments and dividers for organizing your things.Have not yet used the wipes compartment so I can't comment on it.The back most pocket appears to be a main compartment but surprisingly it is a shallow pocket.Due to the construction of the rest of the bag this is acceptable but was odd and a little difficult to get used to at first.All in all the bag is made of durable well-crafted quality; it will, however, take some time to break in the material so that it's not so stiff.It is a great bag for ALL day or trip use.I held off buying it because of the price.Now I'm glad we have it because it's SO nice to have a place to put everything.Zippers open up the pockets completely so they fold flat down.You can see what's inside with no problem.This thing is pretty big and holds a lot.Very high quality and I think worth the money.It will hold up for more than one kid or I'm sure you could use it for a gym bag or something else when a diaper bag is no longer needed.Sure, we havent chance to use it yet, but we sure will be.It have lots of space and fits good on a back, pluss i love that this back pack is easy to atach to a stroller!Material seams to be very durable too.Dad Gear back pack is worth the money!update 1/14/2012We have had this bag for very long time now.Nothing is broken or ripped!this bag been thru mud runs and spartan race's but still are doing great!We go to baseball games and hiking and other activities and this bag still doing just great...i were just reading some of the bad reviews, and i think some people were just unfortunate to get a bad bag, or some maybe are just too picky..Anyway!I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bag!I absolutely LOVE this diaper bag.I love having the diaper hammick so I'm not digging at the bottom of the diaper bag to find my diapers.I also know at all times just how many diapers I have.I love the keys holder so that if I put my keys in the bag, I don't have to dig to the bottom to find them.Most people think it is just a bag that I have and not my diaper bag.I love being able to just throw it over my shoulder and not worry about the straps falling down.He doesn't feel near as "girly" carrying this bag.I wish I would have bought this for my first diaper bag, but I guess until you start using a diaper bag you don't know what you need and would like about one.I needed something to keep keys, drinks, cell phone, etc.I saw some reviews that said theirs was navy- but mine is all black, and matches quite nicely with my Phil and Teds E3.I bought this because its virtually indentical to the Tike Tech one, but half the price.I've put a water bottle & a 32 oz fountain soda in this holder without a problem.Plus, the compartment is great for holding keys, cell phone, MP3 player, etc.And I don't have to take it off to fold the stroller.Seems like a great product, especially for the price.I have an UPPA VISTA, the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them.The Jolly Jumper fits on the handle bars but the bag also sits at a 45 degree angle.Basically, this would work if I always carried around a drink with a cap on it but never an open container.If you have a stroller that will hold the bag level it will probably work better for you.Aside from the angle of the handle bars, I wasn't thrilled with it in general.There is nothing that really gives the caddy any structure so the bottom part swings while the top stays rigid, making things bounce around.I tried this caddy head to head with the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy (which is cheaper) and found that caddy to be better material, better structure and the cup holders stretch to hold larger cups.I know most of the pictures are single strollers but the item description does not mention single or double strollers only says it fits 'most strollers' We have a double instep safari swivel and the velcro had to be stretched so far that we weren't confident it would even hold 2 drinks without coming apart from the weight.It fits great on the handle bar and I love the zippered pocket and front pocket (where I put my cell phone).I was also pleasantly surprised that the "Jolly Jumper" logo is actually white embroidery, not the bright colors shown in the picture.One draw back (not of the actual product, but of it fitting on the Dash stroller) is that when you put the Dash brake on you have to tilt the handle bar down, so a coffee cup or drink without a tight lid would spill.I thought I could make it through my first pregnancy by piling pillows all around me in the bed, but my sleep and my back began to suffer.I caved and purchased this pregnancy pillow and could kick myself for not buying it sooner.My middle back has been aching, instead of my lower back (as it is for most pregnant women), but this pillow provides just the right amount of support so that I can make it through the day without aching.Every night I've had the pillow I have only woken up once or some nights not at all!I am looking forward to using this pillow for tummy support after my C-section, as well.I am so glad I bought it.I first wanted it to help me sleep on my side, since usually I am a back sleeper.I sleep so well.During my first trimester when I was without this pillow, I did not sleep nearly as well.It hugs your body and offers so much support.I did take an old, regular pillow case and cut the end off.And yes, the pillow is big.We have a queen size bed and it takes up a little more than half the bed, but my husband still has room to sleep and hasn't complained.I plan on using this pillow long after the baby is born as well!Set this up, and it literally spun around one time, and then quit.There wasn't enough air blowing to even make a bubble anyways.Bad product - save your money and time and pass on this product.We've had this bubble machine for about 6 months now and it's still working great!My son loves taking baths and now with the bubble machine, he doesn't ever want to get out of the bath.He wants the machine on the whole time.However, he cried the second I turned this on because the device is SO loud as it makes bubbles.It scared him to the point that I got rid of the thing.No other noise has ever scared him before, and he's not a sensitive baby by any stretch.This thing is just too loud to be of any use.The slant is not to high so you don't have to worry about the baby falling off, and it is not to low so you can make sure you get enough water in the tub.Been using it for 3 months now and no problems.I can't really answer why I gave it 4 stars, i know it is silly but I feel like it could be even better in some way i just can't put my finger on how.Bought them to store snacks for my kids.At less than $1 per set, I don't have to worry about losing them.Perfect for our hectic household!we use this at grandparents house as a high chair.i do not use the tray but just push my toddler up to the table.i like the way it will fold flat for storage.The only thing that disappoints me is the metal part right above the handle is weak and breaks after several uses.I change my brushes frequently to avoid a germ breeding ground, but it still breaks before that time.For the price and the design, and for how frequently I throw out my brushes, I would probably still buy this brush.But it is a little annoying to clean the bottle with a brush handle that is broken in half.It is the tallest I could find and strong enough to hold mom or even dad.It supposedly supports 800 lbs, so if you are about to give birth to multiple teenagers and can't quite reach the oreos on the top shelf, this is the stool for you.It's cheaper than the baby bjorn and I can't see how any stool could be much better than this one, so save your money.The only problem I have with this, the top gets scratch easily.Thanks amazon.I would recommend supervision while using this product.I only give it to my daughter when she's teething and not for use as a toy.So far, he hasn't taken to any of the kinds that you put in the fridge, and since he's still perfecting his grabbing/clutching he drops anything that is bigger mostly due to the weight.Oh, and another added plus -- it is small, so several can easily fit in ziplocs in the diaper bag.I ordered this and gave it a shot-with great results.A child can chew on the 'berry' itself, as well as the leaves and back handle--all have a rubbery texture that seems very soothing.Our first one held up well to pretty serious usage, and when it was lost we immediately purchased another.As a side note, the colors and shape are cute and one person even stopped us to ask about it.It's flexible and soft, but rugged enough to help sooth the gums.So I may have to spring for another one.I had to do so to keep my kids from fighting over them and I'm able to keep some in the car and in the house.Four months after my initial purchase the original one is still going strong.It's definitely durable and able to handle the abuse it gets from two teething toddlers!!!!Best investment ever for teething children.It did not come apart on me, and my daughter likes to bite and pull hard.She would just bite on this thing for forever.The funny thing is that she also liked to bit the handle part too.I would recommend this product to anyone, and I have given it as a gift.i'm not certain whether this should be sterilized like a pacifier or treated as a toy.reckon she'll be able to chew on the entire thing (which is what se's attempting to do with her existing ones) and so i got it.I love the idea of it and it's really gummy-perfect for her while she's teething.The thing is just too big she gets frustrated it won't fit in her mouth.this binky shaped teether did not go over well at all.it also is not very durable.i wouldnt buy this again.He's almost obsessed with them!my baby is 6 mo.old, and he already has 2 bottom teeth.He doesn't always want to bite this ( he is more interested in remote controller,) but when he does he would go crazy with it.recommend every mom to get this product because all the babies go through teething.My Baby loves it and i really recommend it to new moms out there!Our little guy will chew on a teething ring for a few minutes before dropping it to play, but this he will keep using and will seek out when he is hurting.We put it in the freezer and he enjoys it cold, but it warms quickly since there is no liquid, but that is not a problem for him.I think that if your little one is the same (does not like pacifiers or binkie's) then you might run into the same issue.My 6 month old son can easily put his thumb in the handle and hold on to  it.He also loves it freezing cold!I would not recommend this product to any of my friends!my babies always chew on their binkies like crazy when teething & this is a bit more firm & bigger than a pacifier.My almost-six-month-old daughter grabbed this out of my hands and put it right into her mouth.She doesn't have any teeth yet but has been trying to chew on things for a while.She doesn't really have the motor skills for teething rings, has had just a little bit of luck with Sophie the Giraffe, but has mostly been chomping on her pacifiers, shifting them to the side of her mouth to chew on them.She's able to do the same thing with the razbaby and gets more of a gum massage than with the pacifier.My daughter never really took to a pacy so I wasnt sure if she would even be interested in this.I recommend this!It is one of his very favorite toys, not to mention a great teether, especially since he can chew on any part - the handle, leafy sides, or rasberry part.He chews on it during bathtime too - I love that it doesn't have holes so it won't fill with water.It truly made him feel better.He's got about 7 teeth now, so he doesn't use it as much as he did when the first teeth were coming in.My little man has rejected all the teethers and/or pacifiers I have ever given him and this one worked!Because the entire thing is soft, it gives them a lot of choices to chew even if it won't quite fit in their mouth yet.Now, if he's fussy and I get out the RaZberry - instant calm!She does like it but it's a little big for her mouth.I think she'll use it often as she gets a little older.It's the only teether pacifier I have.I didn't have a safety strap to hook it to her shirts so we lost the first one.LOL!I will sometimes wet it and keep it in the freezer if she's really drooling.My baby wouldn't chew on nothing that is not made of cloth (fabric) He only uses a MAM pacifier to fall asleep, than he spits it out of his mouth...I've bought every single teether made of soft material even sophie the giraff w/o any luck.To my surprise, when I gave him this, he started chewing on it right away!!Purchased two of these teethers and will definitely replace them if they get lost.Even after the teeth have erupted, this product has maintained its continuity.No complaints here.So glad we found them.Firstly, let me just say that I am very glad that I ignored the "most helpful" review saying that it would come apart.I completely feared this because my baby seems to eat everything he can get his hands on, and he's only about 5 months!Well, I received the product and I couldn't be happier with the concept.It is a soft silicone material, comparable to other teething toys on the market, and my baby took to it instantly.I can't say enough good things about this product.Now about it coming apart, the green and red and green and blue teether's are two parts brought together, however the pink and the light blue teethers are one peice (i.e.But personally, I would recommend the one-color ones; They are just as cute and you won't have to worry about the possibility that it will come apart.Enjoy!It is a little big for his mouth (he is 6 months old), so it doesn't stay in his mouth for real long periods of time, but he does seem to like it.The larger loop (handle) on the teether is nice for him, too.He is four months and gnaws on everything.This teether is great because he can hold onto the handle and get it into his mouth himself.We have a few of these and keep them in the fridge.I was worried my son wouldn't take to this because he is not into paficiers, but this is by far his favorite thing to chew on.I was really excited about this teether.In my mind it made total sense as a solution to teething babies.Unfortunately to my 4 month old this is not as intuitive.This usually results in her spitting it out in less than a minute.In addition when she does move it to her gums to chew on, its rather large and heavy so it ends up falling out the side of her mouth unless someone is holding onto it for her.Would not recommend for early teethers or young infants (6 months or under).We'll try again in a few months and see if she likes it any better.This is perfect for milk storage.I use it with both Medela and Lansinoh bags and it works great with both.I like that it keeps the bags in the front of the organizer and compresses them to freeze flat.I put the newest bag in the back so that the front one is the one to use.I have had one tear with a Medela bag but that is the only issue I have had so far.Update - after 15 months of breastfeeding this thing saw some use.I found that I could not put two liquid bags of milk in at the same time or they would stick together.Eventually I started just freezing bags laying flat, and took this organizer out of the freezer to save room.I will still probably start out using it if I have another baby, but in the end my freezer was taken over by milk and I needed all the room I could get.It fits lots of bags of milk!I use the lanisoh bags instead of the first years ones.This is an excellent product, and fits the Lansinoh storage bags very nicely.Then it was a debate about buying another one or thinking outside the box.I googled storing breastmilk and found that other alternatives are ziploc bags and shoeboxes, and they're more compact for putting in the freezer, so we're now trying those out.However, for organizational and functional purposes, this is definitely the best product I've seen out there!I'm on nursed baby #2 and this by far is much easier to find and use the oldest milk up first because of the way you put them in.Beats bags of milk in other bags scattered about the freezer that you have to dig through to make sure you have the oldest ones.I am so glad that I purchased this.I didn't right away and found it was a much more efficient way to freeze and store milk.If you are trying to bank lots of milk, it doesn't hold much.When I fill it up, I remove the bags and them into plastic freezer bags and move them to a freezer that we are only using for milk.Works with any bags and is a much more compact and functional way of freezing milk rather than trying to place flat.I prefer to use the Lansinoh bags with the organizer.The Lansinoh ones also have the label on the top tab, which makes it easier to see what you have without having to pull the bags out.Dont believe the other reviews.Its really not all that much louder then closing a door.This product has kept our daughters room smelling nice.We have been using it for almost 2 months now and have had no problems with it.You just have to remember to replace the batteries and the filter(can be purchased at stores) every 3 months.I can tell this product works every week when I take the bag out...It really stinks, but yet my daughters room still smells nice!I highly recommend this product!I have owned this diaper pail for more than a year now, and I am less than happy with the product.CONS:- Top heavy - It's very hard to change the trash bag in the pail.You must first lift the lid, then remove a blue rig that holds the trash bag in place, then lift the entire lid off in order to remove the trash bag.The problem is that the entire pail is top-heavy when the lid is lifted, so the pail tends to fall over as I'm trying to get the trash bag out of the pail.- Arms stick - The concept of this diaper pail is good.When a dirty diaper is placed in the top compartment and the lid is closed, two "arms" open up to let the diaper slide into the containment compartment at the bottom.The arms should then close back up to contain odor.The problem is that the arms sometimes stick open causing two problems:  first, the smell in the container leaches out, second, the built in fan continues to run to try to eliminate the smell, wearing down the numerous D batteries this thing requires in no time flat.- Odor - After a year of use, this thing smells even when there are no diapers in it!I had the same problem with my first diaper pail, the Diaper Genie, so perhaps this is an issue with all plastic, porous diaper pails.PROS- Takes regular trash can bags - I do enjoy that this diaper pail accepts regular 13-gallon kitchen trash bags.No running to the baby store for Diaper Genie refills.Overall, I'm not happy with the diaper pail and will be getting rid of it in favor of using a small regular trash can and grocery bags that will need to be emptied nightly.Let me start by saying that there are some very GREAT quality First Years products out there.So, don't rule out the brand entirely, but definitely pass on this particular product.I just put a few more diapers in the thing, and was reminded that I need to write this review warning other parents.The other reviews say it just as well, but I wanted to add my own voice to the outcry.;)First, it does a pretty admirable job of containing the odor.We've got two kids, and nobody has ever commented that our house, or even that particular room, smells at all stinky.However, the cons outweigh the pros...1) The lid mechanism is weird.And annoying.There is a loud clunking noise whenever you close it.We're not talking about a little click, here.If Thing One is sleeping, Thing Two's diapers sit on top of the pail until Thing One wakes up, or else I run the risk of waking Thing One every time I change Thing Two's diaper.It clunks no matter how far you lift the lid, so sliding a dipe in undetected just does NOT happen.So, we end up with a pile of dipes on top of the pail instead of in it.2) The diapers don't go easily into the pail.You should be able to place a diaper under the lid, close it, and the dipe falls down into the pail - that's how it SHOULD work.Unfortunately, if the diaper is in the wrong position, it does not go down into the pail.It lays there, blocking the lid from closing, clunking every time you try to close it.It sometimes takes four or five tries to get the thing closed, and we often have to reach in and turn the diaper a different way to get it to go.This is VERY frustrating, especially when your children are waiting for you to move on to the next task in your day.Yet another reason to end up with a pile of diapers on top instead of inside.3) Fan...?In the two and a half frustrating years that we have had the thing, I have yet to hear ANY kind of whirring, buzzing, or humming from the pail.As another reviewer said, the batteries must be there just to power the little green light.4) Top heavy.Changing the bag involves propping the pail against the wall and hoping the lid doesn't come crashing down on your hand, because that is the only way you are going to change the bag while the pail is upright.And make sure you carry it with two hands, because the one "handle" they give you is little more than a corner, and is 1/2 way down the back, which means that when you try to lift it, the top tips forward and the pail falls off of your fingers.All that to say, as a mom of two, I probably put dipes in the pail about three times a day, in bunches, and the rest of the day they sit on top until I have time to fight with it.We keep it in a bathroom so we can close the door.So, the odor containment is great, but kind of useless given the other issues.We have kept this pail only because we have yet to find another that doesn't stink.Otherwise, it would be out the door and in the dumpster.I read the reviews, some people saying that the lid was very loud when closing, others saying that it didn't work period, others loving it.I decided to try it for myself and am so glad I did.I enjoy the fact the you can use simple 13 gallon trash bags with this disposal and don't have to buy special bags like other disposal systems.I read one reviewer who suggested using only bags with no drawstring and I do agree.I know this because my daughter's room does NOT smell at all and believe me, what is in that bag can smell pretty bad!!I changed the batteries after 3 months of use which I thought wasn't that bad at all and changed the filter after 6 months per the product recommendation.At no time have I had a problem with this product.I would recommend this product to someone else since it's affordable, easy to use, cost efficient (being able to use standard trash bags) and works great at it's main job which is keeping the odor inside it and not in the room!Ok, I have so many reasons why I dispise this diaper disposal.When I first bought this diaper disposal, I was happy that it took regular kitchen sized garbage bags...They should point out that you need to use the kind with the drawstring, otherwise they slide right back into the unit!Second, the way that you "push" the diapers into the bag is by simply closing the lid...well the lid is so loud, it sounds like a guillotine.If I have to do a latenight diaper change, I let the diaper sit until morning because the sound wakes my son up everytime!Next, I loaded it with 4 D batteries..the green light blinked a few times, but that was it.Also, now that my son is eating solids, his diapees are pretty ripe (TMI, sorry), but his room smells like a dump if a few diapers pile up, and I'm talking about a day's worth!Wasn't the whole reason why I bought this was to keep the stink out of the room??Don't waste your money.I'm thinking of donating to Goodwill, and getting a Diaper Champ!I'm very happy with this product.I love the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer, and have used it through 2 children.These replacement pillows are a must.Although, I use mine past the recommended length, just be sure to keep them wet, and you should have no problems.UPDATE (4 stars):In case anyone else has run into the problem I detailed below, I wanted to offer a suggestion for how to get around it.This has almost totally eliminated the gross brown crust situation, and we didn't have to spend any more money.ORIGINAL REVIEW (2 stars):I used these Ever-Fresh pillows since the birth of my son 10 months ago.Other reviewers seem to have had similar issues, so be warned.It is such a disappointment, too, because, otherwise, I absolutely love the Lionheart Warmer.after reading other reviews.Whether I wet it each week or not the pillows still become brown for me.It's kind of a pain to take all the wipes out and wet the pillow.My wipes are still nice and wet when I reach for them.The pillows are supposed to last 3 months, mine only last 1 mo before I notice the odor.It's strange to me that you're supposed to use distilled water for the wipes but it's ok to use tap water for the pillows.I thought maybe that's where the odor was coming from but it didn't matter which kind of water I used, there was still an odor and it still turned brown after a month.When I run out, I'm going to try my warmer without the pillow and see what happens.I stopped buying these and my wipes no longer get "burned".I've stopped using them and no more browning or mildew.Go figure.I bought this product back in 2006 and have been using them ever since(we have had 2 more children).The replacement pillows are nice because as long as you keep them wet, they won't dry your wipes out or turn them brown.They also last for a really long time.I just have to make sure about every other week that I take them out and put some water on them.Eventually, you will notice that they are becoming a little flimsy and that is when you need to change the replacement pillows.If you forget to wet them down each week, they will start to brown, but as soon as you rinse it out it's good as new.The pillows frequently stick to the bottom of the warmer and leave brown stains and decolorations... Other than that I really like the pillows and the warmerI wanted to love this product but I couldn't.It's bulky since the ice pack is built into the cooler.Like other reviewer says, you have to put this whole thing in the freeze.So, it's big and cumbersome (can not fit into a diaper bag really) and holds very little.Good concept since it does stay cold for a long time but just not efficient.A real space saver, this product is worth the $$ if you are washing baby bottles.best drying rack around!i have a very small kitchen and it fits nicely in the corner next to my sink.you can either have it drain directly into the sink, or you can have it drain in the collection tray.easy to clean too!suction cup convenient to store upright by sink to dry after use.convenient nipple brush stores easily in handle.Great for all of my breast pump parts to wash and air dry, and all bottles and accessories to air dry and store.It fits great next to my sink in my kitchen to keep everything organized and clean.I can't comment on the suitability of this drying rack for glass bottles.My wife and I only use BPA-free plastic bottles.It's simple to use, and dries out washed bottles in just a few hours.I bought this before I had the babies thinking it would help with all the bottles that would be sitting around.I still use it everyday, but it isn't has durable as I thought although it is very convenient!It doesn't hold a lot of bottles and the top rack has a tendency to fall if you overload it.I gave it 5 stars because it is very useful when you need to have bottles, nipples, etc... close at hand.It is a little cheaply made and it wobbles when all the weight is on one side, i can see how it wouldn't work for glass bottles.I love putting my pumping parts in this rack (along with bottles and nipples).Also nice after using the steaming bag and putting them on the rack to dry.I usually shake of stuff before putting it in so I don't really ever see water in the drip tray, I think it dries before even getting that far.Mine, though, is  little crocked no matter how I put the center rod, no biggie though.I'm a first time mom, but I'm sold on this drying rack.I've been cleaning down hand-me-down bottles all day and used this drying rack to full capacity.I was amazed at all the bottles and nipples and bottle pieces that I could pile on the rack.Definately a good buy!It's not too big to use a lot of space on the counter, holds my bottles very well, so I can not say that I see anything bad about it.I used this rack when I had my first baby 2 years ago.It also drains into a little dish so it didn't need to sit right next to the sink.I used it to dry 6-9 oz bottles, nipples, and parts to the Lansinoh breast pump.So, sometime they fall off as I am placing something on or off.Another thing is that you can't spin the bottom section with one hand or you'll move the whole thing.You do have to keep one hand on the base.Love the spinning feature - so convenient!This drying rack can store a decent amount of stuff, but the bottom layer doesn't 'spin' the way you'd expect it to.Are people getting paid to rate it well?I can't understand how else they would approve.It's so flimsy and junky.The stand often collapses on itself and the sticks pull right out of place.Save yourself the hassle.I couldn't give mine away for free.Bottle storage.It's super flimsy and even with the plastic bottles it knocks around easily.i have a jenn air gas range.instead of hassling with returning, i will pass along to a friend.Have really used this product.My daughter used it when she was younger, around a year old.It folds in and doesn't really hold stuff up so she can get to it.So well that we keep it in the car all the time.She can have all her books on the tray and they don't fall off the sides or get lost in the floor.Also if we are eating in the car we put her food on there and it's easy for her to keep everything in one place.The 3 sides are foam so nothing is hard and it's easy to wipe clean with a damp cloth.I was really excited about this tray, until I put it in action.I would send it back, but it's too much of a hassle.I'd pay no more than $10 for it if I could!Totally useless!Oh well, you live and learn.We decided not to attach the wheels.There was a slight smell due to the paint but it went away after a few days.We let it ventilate in another room with a fan blowing at it 24 hours a day.It would have been nice if there were no Graco sign.Overall it is nice especially at this price point.It is simple but does not look cheap.My only complaint is that there is an ugly safety sticker on side that outlines the safe use of the changer that won't come off.I know they have to have these but it really is an eyesore.I can fit a baby bottle, a juice box, a canned drink (for me), baby food and other snacks in it.5.They are too long.She can hold it by herself and it seems to leak less than other bottles because of this.My little one doesn't drink the sippy as long so we're not there yet.I love these flash cards.I have the sea, farm, and woodland sets.My 8 week old son will stare at each card and study the different parts of the animal.When he gets older, I look forward to talking with him about the animals.I've taped them to the closet doors right behind the chair that I nurse him in and he stares at them continually.My only wish is that they were laminated or plastic.The cardboard is really thick and glossy, but it will dent if you someone steps on it or mose likely if a baby decides to chew on one of the corners.These covers are nice to have as back up if you cloth diaper.I prefer the velcro or snap covers over these, but I will say that my son as never had a leak in these covers.I could not find them in stores but did here.3 days after switching to these with the training underwear he was potty-trained completely.After two weeks with no accidents we stopped using them and he was able to get "big boy" underwear at Target.He has now been potty-trained for 3 months.So much so that after my 1st son wore the 1st one out, I have now bought a 2nd one for my next child due in a few weeks.long, so it works with the sides).I just recieved this product in the mail today and have yet to use it, but I love the look and size.I am sure my little guy will find it very comfortable when he gets here.If I had to do over, I would buy one that had a completely smooth plastic top instead of this one which has a stitching pattern in the plastic covering.I found that very small amounts of liquid mess can collect in the tiny stitch holes that create the pattern.Anyways, I've had water on it and it seems to hold up pretty well.But it worked out great.My wife just delivered our first kid.Because of the curved shape, he keeps slipping down in between my wife and the pillow while nursing.I finally ended up putting a flat pillow on top of the Boppy to position my son for feedings.The Boppy was became more useful for tummy time and later propping my son up to sit.For anyone who breastfeeds, this is a lifesaver!I wasn't sure I wanted to spend extra money on a "pillow", but this is more than just a pillow.I use it to prop her up after I feed her.She LOVES just sitting on it while she's on the bed or couch.This may seem unnecessary (why not just prop up your arm with pillows), and I must admit I thought this exact thing with my first baby.I sit myself on the couch with the Boppy, turn on Netflix and let the little one nurse for as long as she wants.It's really a great thing.Also, I've never had one flatten at all, and my older kids play with it all the time, plus I use it regularly.This is a must buy for any newborn.I didn't think so before having one but getting one convinced me.Your arms don't get tired and it's more comfortable for the baby too.My wife tells me it's fantastic for nursing and I don't know how I'd bottle feed without it.We also use it when our baby occasionally sleeps in our bed or in our recliner with us because it creates a more secure hold for the child.I got one of these for my first baby, and I am so glad I got it.My husband liked it because it helped him be able to hold our son for more extended periods of time.Since this one comes with a slipcover, It is a great buy, and protects the pillow from spit-up stains.Now we are pregnant again, and I am going to make sure we bring it along to the hospital this time, as I will have to be having a c-section again.If you are making a registry, or need to get a new mom something for a shower, this is a great choice.I always buy it for every new mom I know.i've had it for 11 weeks now and it's still in great condition.it helps me prop him up and makes feeding him easier.we also use it to help him sit up when playing with him, and for tummy time.I purchased this as a back-up to my largerBoppy Classic Nursing Pillow with Soft Boa Slipcover, Teddy Bears.TheBoppy Nursing Pillow with Slipcover, Lots of Dotsis smaller, so it's great to use if you are holding your little one in a chair.I found the largerBoppy Classic Nursing Pillow with Soft Boa Slipcover, Teddy Bearsto be more useful when holding my little guy in bed or on the floor.I used either of them for laying baby in and for tummy time once he was able to hold his head up.I couldn't have breastfed without this those first few weeks!I don't know what I'd do without my boppy.This is by far one of the main things I use and if I could recommend to any new moms or any soon-to-be moms, I would say to get a boppy!It makes everything so much easier, I don't know what I'd do with out it :)When this was first out, you needed it as you didnt have other options, now you do.Boppy's are small, low which causes mommy upper back/neck issues and its use is very short lived.Plus if you have any chest at all they are not that practical.We researched them after I had a boppy for a week, because I hated them, I thought they were outdated for nursing moms/bottle moms and moms in general.It lets you adjust the height!Yep, wether you are tall or short, thin or larger it fits because it isnt meant to go around you, its meant to bring baby to a comfy position for mommy AND baby.This was a lifesaver for breast feeding, bottle feeding, reading books or just holding eachother while they are studying mommy (or daddy's) face.I have heard bad comments because it doesnt have a cover-so what, I throw it in with my darks and its been fine.Plus even with a cover babys spit up and you have to wash the covers and I would still wash the pillow-yuck otherwise.Because you can put the baby higher leaning, it takes away a bunch of gas in the tummy and spitting up since you shouldnt have a baby flat to begin with.Yes we used the boppy for things like holding sitting baby up, using it for a tummy time holder, but that was it.It made nursing my daughter so easy- almost so easy that when I went somewhere and forgot it at home I almost didn't know what to do without it.After about 10 months it started getting a little flat- so i will probably have to use it as a neck pillow and buy a new one for the next baby.This pillow isnt just for nursing it has so many different uses.Works for the cradle hold & the football hold plus its great for propping baby up to sleep and for tummy time supportThis is one of those few baby products we simply can't live without.I breastfed my son for 4 months and this helped prop him easily to eat while my hands were free, crucial for those first few weeks of round-the-clock feedings.It was the only tummy time he had for the first 3 months.As he gets older we find more and more uses.We prop him up on it to drink his bottles now that he is holding them by himself.He has acid reflux and it helps to prop him in it after feedings to prevent spit up.Now that he is sitting, we spread it around him on the floor so that when he falls over he has a nice soft landing.This has been a lifesaver in many ways.It isn't just for breastfeeding mommies.It wraps around your stomach very easily and provides a comfortable place to lay baby down if they fall asleep in your arms.I got the boppy for breast feeding.A lot of mothers told me it was really helpful and while I can see that it would be I only used it once or twice while nursing.It was just a pain in the butt to be carrying another thing around during those first few weeks.Don't throw it in a closet quite yet.There are SO MANY uses for this thing.I used it for a pillow several times and as an aid to prop baby up next to me when they had gas.Several of my friends used it for tummy time.These are all nice uses but I knew I had hit gold with this thing when it was time for baby to sit up on their own.My son would sit up very well but every now and then he would fall backwards.I placed this behind him and I never had to worry about him hitting his head.I could sit him up and drink some water, play with him and his toys, all the while not worrying about him falling all about.You may not 'need' this, but it is a nice thing to have and and use for all sorts of purposes.It can be another set of hands.I bought these spoons trying to save money because it appeared to be similar in shape to my Beaba spoons.I haven't used it yet, but there are plastic stubs that protrude around various parts of the spoon, thus I would hardly call it "soft edge".We have tried just about every type and brand of sippy cup known to man and I hate most of them so when we were in the store one day I threw 2 of these in the cart since they were so cheap.***PRO'S***~Cheap(we bought them cheaper in the store)~Easy to hold even with messy little hands~No leaky spouts~No leaky lid(you have to make sure the lid is on right or it WILL leak)~Both my daughters favorite cup~the cup is easy to wash~Easy to put together~Once you don't need the slow/fast valve it's still a great cup***CON'S***~valve can be hard to wash, you definately need a bottle brush to poke in the valves(it is still easier to clean than their other sippys)~the leaky lid if you don't get it on just perfect, because its really hard to tell it wasn't put on correctly(I've never had it leak on my girls, just if they leave them on their highchair trays it will end up leaking(not the spout) so basically just don't leave it laying around sideways on something you might not want wet)~for the most part, the spout does not leak but there have been times my girls have been shaking it a bunch to get the water out(to paint on their tray) and some water will come out.So I would recommend NOT putting purple grape juice in this and letting your child drink on a white carpet...although I wouldn't do that with ANY sippy cup ; )So basically, these are not perfect but I have yet to find a sippy cup that is.We liked these FAR better than any of their other sippys so we've put the other sippys away and bought 6 of these total.They are easier to wash than their other sippys and basically do not leak.My daughter had a hard time with this cup... the opening is very large and she would choke on the water because it came out too fast.Mine would always fly around in the back and break other things that I had in there with it, but now it stays put and no problems getting it in and out for our shopping trips.A must for the SUV owner!If your headrest poles are thick, this product may not work for you.It didn't fit on my chunky VW headrest poles.Too bad, seems like cool product!My little guy loves the lights, and I was looking for something that would hold his attention.It took him about 5 minutes to figure out how to make it sing to him, and I was trilled.It is easy for him to grip and handle, and I'm sure will be a favorite.Each handle says the colour and plays a light show with music and when you hold 2 handles it names the colour the 2 would make (ex.I am very disappointed with Baby Einstein toys!This is a cute concept but is a lot smaller then it looks in the picture.Has helped him find his binky in the middle of the night MUCH better than he could before, and he seems to like to sort of cuddle with it (while sucking the binky) a little bit as we're reading books and settling down before bed.We have a 6 month old who has been co-sleeping with us.Two weeks ago, we decided to make a transit to a crib.she wont fall asleep on her own crying and was waking up often.I ordered this bunny and received it a week ago.since then, she falls asleep with no nipple or etc with this bunny in her arm!So now i am stopping breastfeeding and this helps it too as she doesn't need my nipple to fall asleep!Very impressed about this bunny.Update.My first one, now 23month, went everywhere with this until 2 months ago.She would not sleep without the bunny.We called her "mrs. Bunny".i wish she stayed with this little one, sigh.I got another one for my second Daughter, 6 month.They are soft and cuddly, yet durable enough to go through the washer/dryer again and again and again.The quality of the product is great and it stays on properly.These are very compact and lightweight to stick in the diaper bag and travel with.They stick easily to any restaurant table we've tried, and stay put pretty well.They have a sticky strip all the way along the top and bottom edges, stay put, yet come up easily to dispose of.My son isn't trustworthy with plates yet, so it's nice to know I'm putting his food down on something clean, not just the wiped-down-with-water table.I always keep 3-4 in my purse at all times.They're also great when you're a guest in somebody else's home and don't want to make a mess on their table.So far, I haven't had any problems with my son being able to pull them off the table.This was my first diaper bag.It remains in my diaper bag collection only as a back-up bag or for the days when my husband takes the baby without me.I know that is totally subjective, but I love gray and I love lime green, so there you go.-The little insert is fantastic.That thing gets used quite a bit.We keep in in the car with two diapers and a little cellophane packet of wipes (not the hard-sided travel case, but the little packet).Wouldn't really be a problem if I didn't keep forgetting that it is a magnet and starting the great hunt for the mysterious missing quarter.Seriously, I have lost more minutes to that damn quarter/magnet thingy than I care to confess.-This bag is totally devoid of style.This is the cinder block of diaper bags.-I can be hard to maneuver in the main pocket- it's kind of a big compartment with a proportionally wrong opening.-The pacifier pod thing is totally useless.I'm pretty sure I threw it out.-The bottle pockets on the outside are a little bit off.And don't even think about shoving a Tommee Tippee bottle in there, not unless you are a magic mad scientist and have figured out how to harness the power of wormholes.Overall, it's just an OK bag.It's really bland looking (it may be good for a man who doesn't want to scream "LOOK I'm carrying a purse/diaper bag) and it's very basic, but functional, and for the price, I think you can do a lot better.I really can't comment on the durability because it gets used so rarely, but for what it is worth, I have had it for a little under a year and I have had no problems with it.I do like the bag--I think it is set up nicely, has plenty of room, and looks really good, but there are a few issues.My zipper broke after a few months of use.The company sent me a replacement, but it wasn't a good sign for such an expensive item.The bag just isn't wearing well.The gray is dirty and easily stained and the shoulder pad is starting to fray.I really like the design and it is comfortable to wear.I also like that it clips to the stroller.Overall, I'd buy it again, but only if the company keeps replacing parts!First of all it is incredibelly easy to fold and unfold.Very light indeed especailly if you compare it to a stroller.The comfort of putting the babies in their car seats is great.To my surprise, it is very easy to manouver despite the lenght of it.I use it with Graco car seats which click right away.There are two issues you should consider, however, before buying.The first is the lenght issue.But it stays long when folded as well.So if you have a sedan, this probably won't fit in the back.It barely fits a small size SUV, so be sure to check the folded length if you can.The second downside is the basket is almost inaccesible when you install both babies.It is big however, so if you can slip in the things you want to carry, it holds a lot.I would recommend buying a mommy-hook to go with it since you need a place to hang your bag.I can't imagine how we would ever have gotten out of the house without it.We have two Graco Snugride car seats that snap into it very easily.I can attach a couple of shopping bags to the stroller handle with the mommy hook and do grocery shopping.The stroller doesn't tip or suffer at all even with a couple of very heavy bags attached to the handle.We began introducing cups at 6 months old and my son is currently 11 months old.Good: It holds a lot of juice and can be tilted over 90 degrees and still function with the straw.It has a soft spout for my child's emerging teeth.He likes this cup the best of all but one cup.That one being the smaller Nuby Sipper that has handles.This cup has a smaller base and will fit into cup holders including the cup holder on the front of a stroller.Since it holds more drink my child will drink more which is a big plus for us since he's very attached to his breast milk!The flip top is easy enough that my child can figure out how to use it.Bad: It is a pain to clean.I had to purchase pipe cleaners to get inside the straw as my bottle cleaner couldn't get it clean to my satisfaction.Our toddler just started walking and this seems to have the least amount of spillage when it hits the floor... of the 5 or so different brands we have purchased.Bad: Straw breaks at top from biting it.Keep in mind in order to drink you have to bite it to get juice out.Glad he didn't choke on it.Also milk seems to be the one bad liquid.It will sometimes leak UP the straw when sitting straight up (the Playtex straw cups did the same).One an airplane ride it literally was shooting from the cup!Update: after purchasing 2 more brands... this is my favorite for the least amount of leakage.It has it moments where it makes me mad.bite) to get the liquid out.Most annoying.Wish I'd noticed before opening the 3 I bought and throwing the packaging.They were actually the opposite.She couldn't get any milk out of the cup, and when I tried myself it was ridiculously difficult to use.It also leaked and shot milk up every time we opened the top.I returned them and will stick with a cup with a simple straw.He was having a hard time tipping the bottle back to drink out of it, and it was just horrible.That was the last day of nursing, ever.So, 10 stars out of 5 for this cup so far.CONS:  We've had this cup for awhile now, I've gotten picky about it, so we're down to 3 out of 5 stars.It is still a good cup, I still use our cups all the time and would buy another one.BUT...I've always had issues with cleaning it.I think I'm cleaning it out really well (scrubbing, hot water, soap) and then I notice some accumulated grime in part of the lid - the horror!The straw is another frustrating cleaning issue.I bought pipe cleaners to clean out the straw portion, which is a little gross to me, but there isn't a better way to do it.Milk will sometimes collect and dry along the edges of the outside of the lid, and that takes a second to blast clean with the dish sprayer.We have two of these cups, and every night after my son goes to bed I have to take some time to thoroughly clean both of them out.The straw is difficult to thread back through the lid, but since I've been doing it awhile it barely takes a second to get it through - you get the hang of it.I forget about it being an issue, but I remember the first time I couldn't get it back in I thought for sure I ruined the cup.It leaks a little bit.There is a little piece of plastic on the inside that goes over a little vent, and it helps if you have the plastic firmly over the vent like it is supposed to be.And, it does leak while upright.If I have a lot of milk in the bottle (formula and whole milk both did this) it will somehow manage to "leak" while the bottle is upright.I've watched it happen.It cracked on the bottom, and had to be thrown away.It only happened once, and it was in the kitchen.I would have been pretty upset if it happened in a store or elsewhere - then we would have a big mess and no bottle."There's a reason hospitals use these!Natural and healthy, easy to clean."This is only type she will keep in her mouth.If you are looking for a pacifier to use when breastfeeding I would recommend these.My daughter refuses to eat more than an ounce or so every few hours, even when she was starving (been like that since she was born, she actually refused to eat the first 72 hours.Guess she never really caught onto the whole sucking thing) and would not accept any type of pacifier(like many parents we bought every pacifier on the market).The advantage to this is that it reduces the chances of nasties lurking in the seams/cracks of where the plastic joins the nipple from improper washing or not sterilizing.Unless you are disassembling your childs two piece pacifier(plastic from nipple) and cleaning it, you're not cleaning it as well as your tell yourself.Some  perhaps your child shouldn't be using them.If your child is not a NEWBORN then it's probably best to move onto other pacifiers more appropriately sized for your child.Everyone is different but I have a hard time believing a NEWBORN(as these are made for NEWBORNS) can swallow the entire pacifier.I've tried and had trouble myself.Other complaints about the lack of 'bulbing' at the tip of the pacifier which makes it difficult for the newborn to hold in it's mouth is nothing more than laziness.Pay your child more attention.If you're sticking a pacifier in a NEWBORNs mouth just so you don't have to listen to them cry, it's probably a good time to rethink your methods of raising a child.I agree, but your child doesn't care:) Just like all the decorations or excessive amount of money you can spend on newborn clothing, your child does not care.If it works, it work.Every child is different.For our kid that had trouble grasping the 'sucking' motions for the first few months(whether it was breastfeeding or the Playtex slow flow latex wide nipples which are the absolute slowest nipples around!), these helped her become strong and healthy!this is the only paci my daughter would use in the 1st months.very easy to clean.Your nipple is round, and I want your nipple to stay that way.It's pacifier tug-of-war and it trains her to keep it in her mouth through suction alone.When she falls asleep, it still falls out, but by then she doesn't care.I agree with some of the negative reviews:This pacifier is ugly.It makes her look like a fish!(I think it's funny, but it definitely isn't my daughter at her prettiest.I wouldn't risk a flatter pacifier with my breastfeeding problems.My daughter would only use this pacifier.Other pacifier's nipple are short and wide.The soothie is the only pacifier with a long skinny nipple.Also I purchased a wubbanub and it has helped her put the paci back into her mouth and cuddle with the stuffed animal attached to the soothie!As for the other reviewer who's baby stuck the entire pacifier in her mouth.Now that my son has his front set of teeth I was hoping to move him over to the harder pacifiers for safety purposes.He puts it in his mouth and spits it right back out.Little did I know that the hospital would stick a binkie in my baby's mouth as soon as he came out to the world.At first (my son's a preemie) they had to cut a portion of the paci so it didn't block his airway - this thing was almost 1/2 the size of his head.I tried switching him to other pacis, useless, either he couldn't grip it, or he'd spit it out.We didn't have any problems (like other parents) with him latching to the paci, only to breastfeed - but if you do have problems - try tickling/stroking their chin/jawline.It made my kiddo open up to feed, but with this paci, i think he could smell it a mile away.I can TOTALLY see why he'd like this, the nipple is shaped like a real nipple.It's easy for them to use and get full suction/grip on it.It comes in a variety of colors, but for some reason, the blue ones were way harder/thicker than the green ones.My son won't use any of them other than the green ones.There's also a paci holder - it's really cute, it turns the paci into a "smiley face" and it snaps on to a penguin or a flower.Super adorable.What I Don't like:After we left the hospital - (we only snagged 3 of these pacis) - they were hard to find.Every chain/grocery store were sold out, and what we did find, we bought all of.So i'm glad that Amazon carries it.We no longer have to keep track of pacis like our car keys and wallet.PHEW!Soothie also makes bottles.I'm wrong.Kid has straight teeth.He still uses his paci in the morning and to fall asleep.This swing has been nothing but trouble since we bought it.For the past 3 months, it would stop working, and then start again when we messed with it enough (which usually involved mashing the buttons, rattling it and calling it names).Now, it's completely dead.Tech support kept telling us there's this "safety feature" that will disable the swing when the legs aren't positioned right, but it quits working even when we haven't moved it.My husband took it apart and found the sensor had gone dead.Apart from the fact that these things break so much, the music on it sounds about like some cheap midi you would hear on an old Super Nintendo, and the "nature sounds" sound like various types of radio static.Utter and complete crap.If there's one thing I've learned, it's that Fisher Price and Bright Starts are the way to go for quality.Everything I've used of Graco I have been unhappy with.The changing table on the matching Graco bassinet we got broke off (when the baby was just 9 lbs!)The hood on the carseat came apart... And it had a safety recall on it...Complete rubbish.My main issue with this swing is that I think that the mechanism that makes it swing is rather loud considering babies sleep in it!If I turn it on after putting him down sometimes the noise will cause him to stir or worse, wake up!I also turn the music on low to mask the sound some.I took out the little headrest thing-a-ma-jig...it was always sliding down and in the way, and I didn't bother putting the tray on...too hard to get a sleeping baby in and out with the tray.I may put the tray on and start using the straps soon...he's close to sitting up (any day now!The transitional headrests are great too so your baby can go from newborn to infancy sitting in here.We haven't installed the tray until she needs it but I imagine it'll be very handy.Overall, great.One complaint and why I gave it 4 stars is the noisy motor.So annoying when I put it on low and baby's sleeping to hear it creek back and forth.This is a great product!We keep it in the car with us just in-case!Our daughter doesn't seen to mind sleeping in it and she is pretty pick about where she sleeps.We camp a lot and this comes in handy.It was easy to set up but tricky to put away at first but we got the hang of it quick.The only down side I've found is that the zipper broke on the bag that you store it in.Kind of a bummer other then that I recommend it to anyone!No fault to Graco, but I wished they had it available as an accessory or add on.:(  Just know what you want before you buy it!I wanted a playyard that allowed you to use it at the higher bassinet level, that also transitioned into a regular playyard as well.This product is fabulous, it is very easy to assemble, AND to pack back up.The design is cute, and not too "loud".I highly recommend this product!I just purchased the Graco Pack n Play w/Bassinet yesterday based on the reviews here and I must say that I am quite pleased with the product.I did notice like a few other reviewers that the bassinet board is somewhat hard (i added an extra thick blanket to make it a bit more plush) and I noticed that the bassinet board does concave slightly in the middle so I'm sure that buyers will need to adhere to weight restrictions of 15lbs (the playard itself has a weight limit of 35lbs).Can easily fit into a standard size trunk or in the back seat of a small car.Very nice AND useful product!Way to go, Graco!We aren't positive if we want our baby to sleep with us for the first little while, which is why we got this pack n play with the built in bassinet.We don't need a full changing table or any of the other bells and whistles the more expensive pack n plays come with, so this was just what we needed.It's small enough to fit through our doors and easy to move around as it has two wheels on one side of the unit.It was super easy to set up.I am 9 months pregnant and I assembled it all by myself.This will get plenty of use after our baby is big enough to play IN it too!Also easy to set up and put away.Love this product and will be using it again with our next one![...]I don't know how many times my fingers have gotten caught in the pack `n play when I am trying to break it down and unlock the sides.I thought this thing was suppose to be for convenience not butchering your fingers?!I'm just glad little fingers are not strong enough to unlock the sides and get their fingers caught!I hung handwashed baby clothes on it and put laundry in it.It was quite usefull indeed and easy to move around when I wanted to vacuum underneath it.What I didn't like about it was that the mattress pad was thin and not well cushioned and it was concave in the middle-which probably can't be helped.(Now I imagine most bassinets whether the pricier ones or cheaper ones are all like that.)I couldn't imagine my baby being comfortable going from the warm softness of mommy's womb to laying in a cheaply padded, concave surface- not to mention the elongated head would be forced to turn sideways because of the lack of cushioning.and  in the winter time it would be impossible for the baby to stay warm since this thin pad will not retain heat.I know that pediatricians recommend a firm surface because of the SIDS scare, but a baby will have a hard time getting adjusted to that so embrace yourself for many nights of a wailing baby.Well my baby is 10 months now and from the moment of birth to this day she had slept next to me in my bed and not only have I never experienced loss of sleep, she never once had a crying fit in the middle of the night except a few quiet whimpers to let me know she was hungry.Well overall I think this would be a good temporary bed if you are not sure about getting a big expensive wooden crib.You won't find out if your baby will sleep fine by herself or not till after the baby's born so I would try this out before spending the big bucks.Also it's a good place to keep your baby in when you need to confine her for a short time.We bought this PnP after previously purchasing a more expensive model with all the bells and whistles by another company.We quickly learned we didn't need all the bells and whistles and it didn't set up or dismantle nearly as easily as the Graco models do.As soon as it arrived I took it out of the box and began setting it up and was done in 4 minutes!We travel frequently and I can almost set this up in my sleep.We use it as a portable bed all the time.Granted, the sitting area is a bit smaller on the Duo, but I am willing to trade the extra space-per-child for a lighter ride.Our Graco car seat will snap into either the front or the back seat, and the toddler can ride where she pleases.- Easy to Store - When folded, this stroller stands upright on its own making it easy to store in a coat closet.- Fits the Graco Snugride 32 (Large Car Seat) - The Graco Snugride 32 (one of Graco's largest infant car seats), as well asother Graco infant car seats, all snap easily into the stroller.CONS:- Sometimes difficult to fold.Make sure you lift the front of the stroller so the wheels turn down and are facing the right direction prior to folding the stroller closed.- Sometimes the sun shades get stuck.Make sure you pull the back of the sun shade to the back, as opposed to mistakenly grasping the front of the sun shade and attempting to extend it back, as this jams the shade, making it difficult to straighten out and set right.Overall a great product for the price.I love this swing!Most swings are pretty similar but this one is also a bouncer.You can easily lift the seat of the wing off and move it anywhere.I think this is awesome because the bouncer is something we only used for such a short time that its a waste of space and money to have just one more gear around the house.It is very hard to lift and secure.We just took ours off the swing so it wouldn't get in the way.I am not sure of the cap off on the discount.I LOVE this pump!I used the Medela Symphony in the hospital and thought it was a good pump, but I only used one side at a time so didn't really need the double pump option.The Swing is just as good as the Symphony but for less money.I have an abundance of milk and need to pump for comfort and this pump is comfortable, and doesn't hurt at all!It has a rubber cup which conforms to your breast rather than sucking your nipple up into it.I would HIGHLY recommend this pump to everyone!Great Product....easy to use...I find it works best to pump while I nurse on one side, I pump at the same time on the other!I never thought I would care enough to review a potty, but I just hate this thing!I haven't had the smelling issues that others have - but we do rinse and squeeze dry the little cushion after each use (with a towel designated for that purpose).This is an extra step that makes the cushion more of a pain than anything, but as other reviewers have said, you can't use the potty without it!What I absolutely HATE about this potty is that it is so gross to empty.We have tried 3 different potties (one at each grandparents, and this one) and this one is the most disgusting when it comes to dumping it out.The bowl part has a ledge on which the cushion sits.The other potties we had are more bowl-like and don't have multiple levels to clean off after being dumped.On the positive side, the inside is slick and contents don't stick.Another irritating thing about this potty is that urine inevitably goes between the cushion and the "ledge" that holds it.We have a little girl, so this isn't just a problem for boys.Basically, if she isn't leaning forward while she goes, there is pee all over the little ledge and cushion.So it all has to be cleaned (and cleaned well, because the cushion is absorbent) each time.It may not seem like a big deal at first, but it starts to get old fast.Finally, there is no back rest or support.Our daughter is only 11 months (we practise Elimination Communication) so she can get a little rowdy and squirmy, and although she sits well, we have to make sure that we're right there in case she bounces backwards a bit too enthusiastically.If sitting properly on it, her feet don't yet touch the ground (she is about 29 1/2 inches).I would throw it away and buy a new one (we loved the Nuby one we bought at Wal-Mart in Canada) but I hate to add more plastic to a landfill on account of my own stupid purchasing decision.My advice - don't forget about what it will be like to empty when you are looking at potties!Simpler is better!DO NOT buy this potty, for multiple reasons.1) The padded seat area is, as another reviewer called it, a "glorified sponge".It basically will soak up anything that gets on it, which in this case, happens to be pee and poop (see #2).The opening is too small, I think.It then gets all over his bottom and his thighs as he tries to get up and proudly look at what he's produced.He hates this feeling and this has been our only complication in potty training so far.I would definitely not buy this as a potty though.Soft toilet seats have been around since the 1500s (yep, I looked it up), and so one would assume Safety First would have used the latest technology when designing their potty chair.As in, some kind (any kind) of waterproof layer that protects the padding from moisture.If you already bought this seat, and can't take it back, you can always make an improved ring by cutting a hole in a washable pillow.I have four other Safety 1st products in my home right now, and they are all about as ...worthless, disappointing, frustrating... as this seat.FYI: The cabinet latches are cheap and flimsy.My son took off the latch to the oven door three days after I put it on (he wiggled it, pulled it, and the foam tape came off of the oven door AND the latch itself - and this is while the oven was cold).The toilet lock stuck to the lid just fine, but didn't stick to the side of the bowl.I thought maybe the toilet was too curved or slick for the lock, so I bought some more foam tape and tried it on our other toilet - which was an even worse fit.Since I have yet to find anything made by Safety 1st that isn't cheap crap, I think I'm done with this brand.These are definitely my favorite spoons, but several have melted in my dishwasher.I put them in the silverware basket, even without metal silverware next to them, but they have still melted.It might be better to put them on the top rack in a basket.They hold baby food nicely, even the runny stuff that flatter spoons won't hold.They won't hurt the gums and are long enough.I bought these because of the bright colors and long handles.I like the deeper bowls but find them to be a bit messier than the spoons with more shallow bowls.I am guessing that as my daughter gets older, she'll have an easier time eating with them.Or maybe she's just a messy sort of eater.The mess is a small issue, though, because these spoons are otherwise great and clean up easily and well.I have a set of the temperature-sensitive spoons and the covers are stained after not even two months of use.These spoons are a great buy for the money and i recommend them to anyone.As if feeding baby wasn't messy enough already, these spoons have such long heavy handles that no matter what you set them in (little bowls, cups jars...etc.)Now you not only have food all over the baby and tray, now it is all over you and the floor and you are left with a dirty spoon.The upside is that the dogs like them!They look innocent enough until you go to use one ... then you see the problem (lol).The handle is heavy enough that often when you place the spoon in a dish with a low/narrow mouth the spoon tips over and falls onto whatever surface you are using to feed.As a result there is a splattering of food to clean up.Many of the infant bowls out there are low, small and narrow.Sure, you could use a regular sized bowl but if you have a very young child who is only going to have a small amount of food, trying to scoop out watery, pureyed veggies, fruit, rice cereal etc will have you scooping all over the bowl.Cute spoons, but someone didn't think when they designed these.soft spoons.They do not seem to hurt his gums when he bites down on them.I would highly recommend these spoons to anyone.I bought my first pack of Munchkin spoons at a store because they caught my eye and I generally like Munchkin products.I bought this second pack because my little guy likes to hold on to at least one during meals as well he uses them as drumsticks on his toys, so I always felt in short supply.The only con really is the handle.While it is a great length and I like its size for gripping, its uneven weight distribution with the rest of the spoon has caused it to tip out of many a bowl of food, often flinging food to the table or floor.Solved that problem by not resting it in the bowls anymore.Overall, would recommend to a friend.They have a nice long handle, and they tip is small, but not to small.They are nice and soft, but durable!These spoons are great.The extra length and just the overall feel of the spoon in your hand is above and beyond other spoons I've tried in the past.These spoons are perfect to scoop up pureed food from little jars - nice long handles.Love these spoons!I found them so much easier to feed baby with than the typical Gerber spoons that are used so often.They are soft for baby and easy for mom to use.They also clean very easily.I like these spoons.Also, they haven't stained the way some plastic spoons can.The downside, as other reviews have noted, is that they do tip very easily.Just a note - I found out the hard way that these spoons can melt if they are washed in the silverware bin in the dishwasher.I'm not sure whether my dishwasher is especially hot, but I haven't had any problems since I've been washing them in a bin in the upper rack.After using for a few weeks if was great.The food wasn't dripping off and was way less messy than other spoons I had used.These spoons are great!These spoons are the best for new eaters...I tried several other brands and I love the longer handles on these.We only used these maybe 4 mos before my son wanted a spoon that gave him more food per bite.I bought these spoons based upon some of the other reviews and like them.In my experience, they are good spoons, but could use one little improvement.The spoons are very durable, having been through many washes in the dishwasher with no problems.(Some of the brands of other plastic and gel spoons that I have tried melt and curl up in the dishwasher.)I also really like the size and shape of the bowl of the spoons.The bowl was more than soft enough for my son's gums in the beginning but is durable enough to stand up to his stronger, toothy bites now.Also, the length of the spoon is perfect- great for reaching down to the bottom of those level 3 jars.The PROS said, these do have some CONS as well.I do NOT like the point on the end of the spoon nor the fact that the spoon is not balanced.I can't tell you how many times during feeding that I have put the spoon in a half-eaten jar or container, only to have it fall out and splatter food everywhere.Or, as happens just as often, the point gets caught on my hand or arm as I set it down to reach for my squirming child, flipping the spoon around and, once again, splattering food everywhere.I go back and forth between these spoons and the older-type gerber spoons.And as someone else mentioned, the handle is heavier than the spoon side, so it falls out of narrow or plastic containers, making a mess.I recommend getting a set of these and a set of gerbers.I haven't had any problems with these spoons.I really like them and would buy them again.They have held up very well in the last year of baby feeding.Not great for a toddler to feed himself with, but super for feeding him!These spoons have a handle much like a larger toothbrush and very soft tips that are somewhat bendable.They are long, but my son was able to use them a little when he decided to grab on since the handle is thicker than most other infant spoons.I liked these better than the other types of spoons (like the coated gerber ones) since they are a little flexable and I could actually get food to stay on them.The only downside, since they are so thick they take up a bunch of space in a utensil organizer, but this wasn't really a big deal.These spoons are nice and long.This spoons are not for first time eating.Once I ordered them, I noticed that the box said for 7m+.Needless to stay, I used them once or twice but I ended up ordering the right spoons.Although I love the tip of the spoon--they are perfectly sized for feeding, especially for runny pureed foods--they are very heavy on the handle, causing them to flip and fall out of the bowl and onto my lap or the ground.The spoons are imbalanced and if you leave the spoon in the pack, they always fall out and I end up with baby food on my pants and on the floor.So frustrating!Great spoons!I let him hold one while I feed him with another one and he really enjoys that.Love the long handles on these spoons for easy feeding.Other than that, these are very easy to clean and they go smoothly into my baby's mouth!These spoons are just right.My daughter likes to play with them and bite them and they take the abuse and I don't have to worry about her hurting herself or the furniture.The only downside is that it is too long to fit in the travel spoon/fork cases but it is not a big deal at all.It goes in a ziploc bag instead.I've used the rubber tipped ones as well and those ones can't even compare to these.Save your money.Pros:*BPA-free*Deep basin - deeper than any other spoon I tested, you can put and deliver more food to the baby's mouth.*Soft plastic tip helps to make sure that the baby's upper lip holds on to some food*Colors do not fade from washing or contact with food ( I only hand washed them, not sure what would happen if they went into dishwasher)*Easy to hold for an adult feeding a baby, as far as you put them down only on a flat surface.Cons:*Spoons flip easily when left in first and second stage baby food jars, perhaps they are good for stage three, but I am switching to home made baby food and feed kids from shallow bowls*Scratch easily because plastic is so soft - might be uncomfortable for baby's mouth when scratched (and I only hand wash them, nothing scratchy ever used)*Made in China (what is not nowadays)*Warning from manufacturer: "Do not boil or steam sterilize" - I wonder why?Overall: These spoons would be great if the handles were not so heavy.This spoon handle is way too long and heavy.After using them for a month for our six m/o twins we got these spoons: Meal Mates Colored Soft Bite Spoons - 5 pack by The First Years Meal Mates spoons do not have such a nice soft tip, there is not much room for the food on that spoon comparing to Munchkin soft-tip, but at least the spoons are not making somersaults.The Meal Mates also got discolored quickly.They are made of stainless steel with plastic coating on the tip.As usual these are made in China, but the manufacturer responded to my email request that they are BPA and Phthalates free.I am going to try a pricey Avent spoon nextAvent Weaning Spoons 2-pack, they are made in GB and are supposed to be free of all bad chemicals.We still use Munchkin soft-tip for the foods that contain a lot of liquid, but while feeding two babies it's easy to forget the spoon in the jar and sure enough it flipps.They have made it through many washes on the top shelf of the dishwasher with no problems.These spoons are great for feeding baby!They have an easy to grip handle.They are soft tip for baby's gums.This ended up being a bad idea for us because having a cheerful looking frog on the faucet made it much more appealing than it was before when our son mostly ignored the faucet.Now it is just a bath toy since it never stays on for very long because he pulls it off.We don't have a little thing to pull up on the spout to make sure it sticks on.That said, if you can get your kids to look at it, rather than touch it, it might serve its purpose well.Although, it is still pretty hard if they hit their head on it - maybe something softer would work better.So - not great, not terrible.I wouldn't buy it again, obviously.This spout cover does not serve it's purpose.It is so hard that there isn't much different between hitting your head on a metal spout or hitting your head on a metal spout with this hard piece of plastic over it.It also does not fit a standard spout and has not flexibility to it to make it fit.We tried it and our spout was an 8th of an inch shorter than where the hole was on this so it kept filling with water and shooting it out the back.We returned this item and purchased an inflatable spout cover which is far superior.It's softer and because it's inflatable, it's easy to flec it around your spout no matter what the size.My babies (like most) don't like to lay down all day (who wants to stare at a ceiling all day).He's 3 months old and normally only wants to be held, however, he sat in it for the first time today and he happily stared at the frog hanging above for 30-40 minutes.We started putting our son in his jumperoo fairly early because he was tall and he wanted to stand all the time.At first he'd just kind of stare at everything.Then he realized he could grab the toys.Finally he realized he could jump and he's been a jumping fool ever since!He jumps like crazy and plays with all of the toys.I like the toys except for the color wheel that spins it seems rather boring, but I think the other selections are stimulating & easy for her to play with.It is not terribly awkward to move around, which is nice.At 4.5 months she figured out how to jump in it and will usually jump the whole time she's in it.However it seems sometimes she gets upset from all the jumping but can't figure out to stop herself so she'll start whining while she's jumping.They are average height and weight.It takes 2 AA batteries for the lights and sound, but these features can be turned off.I got this jumperoo for my daughter as soon as she could hold her head up well.It's definitely worth the money.It's a great exercise thing for her, she loves the jumping.It also has all those fantastic toys for her to play with.Finally it gives me some time to cook dinner because I know she's not trying to eat the TV or anything while she's in it.The negatives to is the sizing up straps.They don't fit well for everyone which is understandable.My daughter is really tall for her age so every time I have to go up a strap she doesn't have enough weight to reach the floor, so I have to put mats under her feet.It doesn't last for long.The only other thing is that geting the straps into the 3rd position took me hours and many many finger pains.It's a little hard to adjust them in the first place, but the #3 spot is almost impossible to position.This really is a great toy and if you have the money I suggest you get one for your baby.However, upon further research I found that those toys were some of the most dangerous on the market.I tied wood toys to the other slots, and my 5 month baby loves it.She loves the cause-and-effect from the motion sensing toy, and loves being able to jump.I wish I knew the names of all 4 songs it plays in continuous music mode so I could sing along.I was concerned that it was treated with flame retardants because of a notice on the tags, but I called the company and Mattel said none of the Fisher Price toys are treated with flame-retardant, including this one.The main downside is that it is bulky in our small house, but I don't see how it could be any smaller and still allow for jumping.The other thing I don't like about it is the annoying elephant noise.He couldn't hold his body up but he did have good head control at the time.He was entertained by the toys even though he didn't start to grab them until he was closer to 4 months.Now that he's almost 5 months, he spends time in this every day.It's really strengthened his leg muscles (read: kicks mom more), but he enjoys it a lot.There are many things to look at and I like that it swivels so they can turn around, looking at things in the room as well.The cover is washable though I haven't tried that yet.He much prefers this to sitting in an infant seat or on his playmat.It has quite a few toys around for her to play with and she really seems to like to jump around in it.We have been very satisfied with this purchase.He really enjoys looking at the frog & bird that hang from above.He has an easy time playing with all of the toys.and the elephant faces out and it's hard to turn, also the Monkey as stated in other reviews only moves toward the baby and there little hands can get caught in there (??)Bad design on fisher Prices part!Hopefully this doesnt become a problem with our son.Overall Im happy with this jumper and the price I paid well worth it in my opinionI rated this product just "okay" and I would not buy it again.If I had it to do over again, I would buy 2 exersaucers over this.They aren't much for jumping in it, and if your baby is anything like mine, they will lose interest in the toys that are on it quickly.If they aren't one to jump, you won't get much use out of this.I would recommend spending the money on an exersaucer that is going to keep their interest.I think this is just a "trendy" toy that people like to have but when it comes down to it, it's not necessary.But after reading reviews and looking at photos I decided to buy it.It was by far the best thing I have ever purchased!It has multiple levels so she can use it as she grows and it folds flat so I can take it to Grandma's house.It also makes animal/jungle noises everytime she jumps ( you can turn this on/off this feature as it tend to get bit irritating).I would recommend this item to anyone ad would definitely say it was worth every penny.Buy it!I was worried about the benign neglect of a jumperoo, but my baby was getting restless and bored lying on his tummy or back or in a pack or a stroller... you get the idea.Now, he is able to expend some of his energy so that he can be happier on the floor getting ready to crawl.I put it in the kitchen as I get my morning coffee and he hops joyfully, playing with the toys, grinning, for about half an hour, then eats breakfast, bathes, and naps--no tears, no fuss.my son is only 3 1/2 months but has excellent head control so we got it and put a few books under his feet (because he can't reach the ground yet!)no problem to put together and so much fun!This was very easy to assemble and had plenty of toys to keep my 5 month olds attention, but not too much to be overbearing.It was a little high for him even on the lowest setting so I had to put a pillow under his feet but it wont be long before he'll grow into it.It offers toys for the baby to play with in addition to just jumping, which can get old fast.We were a little confused by the bee toy (firefly, whatever it is supposed to be).Sort of misleading.Still very much worth the money.My daughter Loves to jump in this jump-a-roo!She gets so excited to jump in it that I cant let her stay in it too long, I'm scared she jump herself sick, lol.Well worth the money.It keeps her entertained for up to an hour!My only complaint is that the little bug that's supposed to stick straight up arrived all floppy.The package looked like it had been opened and re-taped, so I wonder if Fisher Price is using amazon to sell returned items.Floppy bug doesn't matter to me so I kept it.He never complained to take him out.Our dr. told us they do not recommend this because it interferes with motor skills, I wasn't totally convinced, so I continued to use it about twice a day for 20 min.I noticed our baby became more fussy, and more demanding.He didn't like to sit still and play like before.He would move his head back and forth and seemed to want to go, go, go all the time.We realized he may be over stimulated.Although I am going to miss it, and I am sure he will too, we are going to get rid of it.I was saddened to read the reviews that quoted their babies could sit in it all day and that some would fall asleep in it.I just think if you use it, try to keep it as minimal as possible.I bought the jumperoo for my 3-month old grandson and within 2 days my daughter had her "Crazy Legs" video uploaded to the internet.A MUST for all babies!My baby didn't like it much in the beginning.She just sat in it and didn't use it for jumping.Now when she is 6 month she start to jump in it and can spend about 20 min.I can eat my lunch while she's watching and entertaining me jumping in it.Toys are fun and dragonfly is always in her mouth:)It seems to be stable and in my opinion it's much safer than door jumpers.Early Intervention/physical therapist says to limit babies usage to no more than 30 mins a day!Same goes for other Jumpers that hang from the door frame.Its not good for their legs.this is bulky and hard to move.At first, my daughter didn't really like it in here (she was 3 months old when I first put her in).However, now that she is 4 months she has learned to jump/swing herself about and she's actually playing with the toys.She spins the sun, the lizard, swings the bird, and spins all the toys.The reason I rate it 4 stars instead of 5 is because even at the lowest setting my little one still cannot touch the floor (I have to put a box so she can jump).Also, the music/sounds are horrible and repetitive!When I try to put the music on she hates it, I have to lower the volume and leave the animal sounds without music only.I'm not sure if mine is faulty, but when I switch it to the music section the animals go "crazy" not letting the music play through..too repetitive!This would have gotten 5 stars if they included good music (maybe classical music would have been nice) and a lower setting for the jumping section.Other than that my baby stays in here for more than an hour, enjoys it and smiles a ton.By four to five months I decided it was time to get a jumperoo and went out and purchased this product.I know there are people out there that say jumpers are bad for babies hips and back and I can understand why.I decided to talk to my pediatrician and a physical therapist before buying.I got some really good tips such as transitioning the use of it in time increments and making sure that he was physically ready for it.Also I only use it once a day and do not use it to baby sit more like I want to email and he gets a little jumping time in.It was so easy to put together and use.The toys on it really grew with my son over time.I was not a fan of the teether, the paint came off kind of easy and it got thrown out pretty quickly.As he grew he noticed something new every time I would put him in it.Now he just jumps and jumps and jumps and yells out in glee for the entire time he is in it.When he starts to get tired I try to walk over and take him out of it and he starts jumping in defiance as if to say, no I am not tired, please don't take me out of this thing.My son probably loved this jumperoo even more than breast milk for his 6th and 7th month.The unfortunate thing is that it only lasted 2 months.He didn't care for it before the 6th month and got bored with it once he started learning to pull himself up on his own.If you don't have a problem with spending the money for a toy that doesn't last long this is a no brainer.If you're on a budget though, I'd look elsewhere or try and find one used.My daughter is 7 months old, so we are getting a late start on the jumperoo.I wasn't going to purchase one (we already have a play mat, exersaucer, swing, etc.I purchased this particular jumperoo based on reviews and also my friends' recommendations.We weren't disappointed!She jumps, jumps, jumps and yes, has even jumped herself to sleep a couple of times.I definitely recommend this purchase, especially if you have an active baby.This thing is perfect for him, we put him in it when he was only 2 months old and at the time, he would just hang on it and touch the toys.He would be okay in it for only about 5-10 minutes, and we figured this was one of those silly toys that wasn't going to get much use.WRONG!Now at 5 months he loves it so much, it is part of his twice a day physical play routine!After a good 15 minutes in this thing he is ready to sleep through the night!He jumps and plays with the toys so much getting so excited it is so fun to see.I know friends that purchase other comparable jumpers and they are either too high to the ground, all in one color which is not beneficial for their development, or too low to the ground.It is the perfect height from level 1 to 3, the music is fun NOT annoying, the spinning toys are very interesting to him.The other reviewer mentioned the peekaboo tiger and spinning wheel are useless...I agree, they seem like an after thought but the rest of the toys on it are so much fun!She is currently 25 inches tall but her toes just skimmed the floor so we had to put a shoe box at the bottom so she could jump hahaha.The moment she was in the jumper she was smiling and looking at us with a super excited expression on her face.We have had it for a couple of weeks and every time we put her in it she is happy.It is great to hear her giggles and squeals when she plays with all the toys on it.I am glad we went with this jumperoo.For the past two months, I've watched my son develop and grow in this thing.But my husband liked to stick him in it and he'd just dangle there (yes, it was on the lowest setting)!I tried to nicely tell him he wasn't ready for it by saying "how would you like to hang from your diaper?"...hinting that he needed to grow a little first.Then, as he got a little older, he started reaching for and grasping at the toys, and recently started actually playing with them.On the day he turned 5 months (2 weeks ago), he was still dangling...2 days later, he finally hit the floor (man they grow fast)!It was almost like you could see the light go on...he was like "so THIS is what this thing is for!"Added bonus...I get to cook dinner and talk to him while he bounces and it gets him nice and tuckered out for bedtime:)  I can't think of a single thing I don't like about this product!He is now nine months old and has used this jumper every day since then.He loves to jump and play with the various toys.At first he played with all the spinning wheels and the teether but now that he is taller, he loves to reach for the hanging bird and frog.We have adjusted the height setting one time and still have one more setting to go, so I anticipate he is going to get several more months use out of this toy (the weight limit is 25 pounds and our son is almost 20 pounds right now).This jumperoo requires batteries but we have only had to replace them once so far.This is a great toy to help your baby get used to being in an upright position and for exercising their legs.Also, this jumperoo is much safer than a doorway jumper.The only negative to this jumper is that it takes up quite a bit of room.She goes NUTS in that thing!She loves all the things she can spin and grab.The sounds and music are really cute too.and it always keeps her busy.I'm going to be very sad when she outgrows it.I totally recommend people give this a try.I know they are not for every child (the lady I got mine from said her granddaughter cried when she put her in it), so have your child try it out first.My little girl is only 10 weeks but still gets a kick out of this thing!!She's only entertained for about ten minutes at a time because she cant touch the ground yet and doesnt really have the hand-eye coordination to play with any of the toys, but I sit her in it and start the lights and music and she just stares, amazed, and trys to bat at the little hanging parrot and monkey.(Mommy gets a kick out of how funny she looks hanging in it too)After seeing one of these at our friend's place, we purchased one too.Our baby loves being in it and it is great for parking her there while I am cooking or taking care of some other household items with her in the room.One tip: my baby's feet didn't reach the floor when we first got this (she was too short), so we placed a board game box underneath her feet so she could start jumping away.The first day we put our 6 month old in this jumper he seemed confused and didn't know what to do.He loves jumping in it and it entertains him for a very long time.He doesn't seem too amused with all the toys; sometimes he'll look up at the bird and frog, but he's doesn't play with the other things.He enjoys the music though.I know he's really having fun when the animals make noises.Although he doesn't play with the toys, he loves jumping in it which is why I gave it 5 stars.I haven't folded it yet, so I can't say much about that, but I kow I like having that option.I bought this for my 3 month old daughter and was worried that it wouldn't support her enough.She spends an hour at a time in it, and I think she will enjoy it even more as she gets older and figures out how to rotate herself.As another poster mentioned, I can see how her fingers could get pinched in between the elephant and the green frame, but I'm not too worried about that.This has really helped strengthen her legs and core - it was money well spent!I also like the design of the baby going around the toys instead of the other way around.My little girl loves this toy!She has sat in it for a few months, but is just now able to reach the ground.She literally walks in circles for 30 minutes straight and just laughs and giggles the entire time.it was very easy to put together but my 7 month old isnt very entertained by the table he wants to get out of it after less than 5 monutes and I only had this toy for a week.If you have carpet I wouldnt recommend it its hard for it to rotate.I only give it 2 stars because it was simple to put together but as far as the toys on the table to entertain a child they could of been better.They do not completely cover the seat but they keep it pretty clean.We have a mini van.I had no issues getting this to fit on my car seats like other reviewers had.I researched different seat covers and decided to purchase this one.I like that the material is clear plastic so it blends in with any type of interior.It was great that it came in a two pack so I had one for each car.Very easy to clean and easy to attach to the seats.I vaguely remember reading reviews for this product when I registered for it.I should have listened, so I ask you listen now.You are much better off buying items that you will need separately.It seemed like a good idea to just get this kit and cover all my bases.These are the things from the kit that I have used so far- my daughter is 9 months old.The bulb syringe is impossible to squeeze and offers no suction- useless.The thermometer seems to take forever to take a reading, which is no good with a squirmy baby.I had to remove the plastic cover from the clippers in order to see baby's nails better- the first time I used them I cut my daughter's finger because I couldn't see them well.I like the brush and comb.Yes, you will probably spend more money buying items separately, but that is because the stuff that comes in this kit is cheaply made.The hospital will give you a good bulb syringe when you deliver.That is all you will need the first few weeks, and you should have quality products that work well.It has all of the essentials in it for caring for your infant.They DO NOT STICK!!!!Great idea, but they dont work.I ordered 6 of them and none of them worked.I laugh at the self stick adhesive.It didn't stay on for the test run!I am 26 weeks pregnant and my main problems were waking up during the night with lower back pain, trouble just "getting comfortable" in bed, and back pain throughout the day.I still wake up during the night but I am able to fall back asleep much more quickly because it is easy to get comfortable.While I think I made a good purchase, there are definitely some pros and cons to consider:Pros:--You can switch from side to side without having to move or adjust the pillow--The pillow holds its shape and doesn't get flat--The pillow has awesome back support!--Removable, washable cover in a neutral color (mine is brown)--I think this will make an excellent nursing pillow, supporting both mom and babyCons:--Cover is not very soft...I sometimes get the urge to put a soft blanket between my head and the pillow--It gets kind of noisy when I switch sides or am trying to get "adjusted"....not so good if your husband is a light sleeper.Luckily mine could sleep through a tornado!--It's pretty big.If you are sharing the bed with your husband, it would be best to have a king size.--It's a little pricey, in my opinion.But then again, can you put a price on comfort and sleep?At least the shipping was free!I would definitely recommend this pillow to other pregnant women.Just keep in mind how much space you have in your bed and if you have room to store it!Best sleep I have had in a long time.Im almost 14 weeks pregnant and can no longer sleep on my stomach and this pillow is perfect!I purchased this pillow based solely on the overwhelming positive reviews for this product on Amazon.I cannot state enough how disappointed I've been since using it.I find this pregnancy pillow to be extremely uncomfortable and somewhat difficult to use and here's why:1.The Pillow Cover - the pillow cover for this product is very difficult to get back on the pillow once taken off.I had hoped that the cover would be loose enough so that one person could easily slide it back on.I couldn't get it back on by myself at all!I had to have my husband help me and he did most of the pushing and shoving of the pillow back into the case.I washed this pillow with cold water once... there wasn't a ton of shrinkage due to that.The cover design is poor in that it is too tightly fitted.No pillow case should require 2 people pushing, shoving and stuffing the pillow to try to get it to fit back in.2.Body Temperature Issues - Based on most of what I've read about pregnancy, most women's temps go up at least 1 degree during this lovely time.I keep the temp at around 70 or 71 degrees and have a drafty condo.While using this pillow at night with 20 - 30 degree temps and drafty windows, I burned up.I would literally wake up sweating whereas not using the pillow and having 2 blankets and 1 sheet I was fine.The only way for me to be semi-comfortable in regards to the body temperature issue was to literally turn the heat off.I have used regular bed pillows between my knees and 2 under my head and I was never this hot.3.Overall Design & Comfort - I have had to use 2 other regular bed pillows with this product to make it comfortable.I've tried sleeping with this pillow positioned at opposite ends and both are horrible though the open end at my head is the easier to deal with of the two.One reviewer on this post who also gave the product two stars said that she tried placing her left arm underneath one of the legs of the pillow to try and get more comfortable, but that only managed to put her arm to sleep.Did the exact same thing to me.I have not had one restful night of using this pillow by itself since purchasing it.I have to use other pillows to make it reasonably OK.I do not get the supposedly great back support that is listed in the description of what the pillow is supposed to give you either.4.Too big, I think.I think they could have made this either one long piece or 2 separate smaller pillows for pregnant women to use.Overall, I am highly disappointed with the money I spent for this product.If it wasn't such a hassle (because of the sheer size of the thing and just being pregnant and feeling unwell most of the time) I would have shipped it back to the company within 3 days of using it.$70 is way too much to pay for a product like this.If you are dead set on buying this pillow, see if your local store (Walmart, Target, Sears, Kohls, etc.)has it before purchasing it online just so you can easily return it if it is not to your liking.The president of this company emailed me in early January asking me how I liked the product.He stated that if my review was positive to go ahead and post it on Amazon, but if not, to let him know before posting a negative review so that he could possibly "fix" the issue.I emailed him and told him that I was not happy with the product at all and since there isn't a whole lot he can do about it, I didn't expect much.I feel that I need to be honest in my review of the "Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow" because $70 used in this economy and during an uncomfortable period in most women's lives is too much to pay for a below average product.You really should save your money and either use your own pillows or buy 2 smaller ones at your local store.I remember back in my first trimester looking over Amazon.com's selection of maternity pillows.I am so glad I decided on this one.The fact that it covers your back and front is really nice.The back on it provides me with just a little bit of back support, but what a difference that makes!With it there is NO PAIN!I sling one arm under the pillow, one over, I tuck the otherside into my back, and my head rests in the middle.When I need to get up (every 2 hours to pee) I simply kick the front of the pillow out of my way like a door, slide out of bed, and when I come back I just close the door again.It makes flipping over in bed easy to.I don't have to move the pillow to the other side of me, since both sides are identical.I remember someone posting it was "hot".I mean it is as hot as a sheet would be, not like a blanket.And you don't really wear the body pillow on top of you, it is on the side of you.Anyway, I can't imagine a better maternity pillow, and although $50 seems like a lot to spend, it really has been worth it for me, and I'm pretty dang cheap.I got this pillow so that I sleep on my side.It's ok but it is bulky and hard to turn from my right side to my left side.I used it for only 2 days.UPDATE 3/25/12:  I have long since had my baby, but thought I would share that I brought it tent camping while I was still pregnant and it was fantastic!!We did use a queen size air mattress, but with the air mattress and this body pillow, I was very comfortable sleeping in a tent by the beach.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I purchased this when I was at 22 weeks because I started experiencing hip pain.I tried sleeping with a pillow between my knees, but the pain persisted.I've been using this pillow for 2 weeks and absolutely LOVE IT!!!!It provides a head pillow, pillow support for my back, my belly, and for my legs all in one.What's even better is if I switch from my left to the right side, I don't need to bring the pillow with me.It's already there because it surrounds you.I just nestle into the keyhole opening and I'm good to go!I am 5'2", and fit fine within this pillow.In fact, its about as wide as half a queen size bed, so hubby can't inadvertently sneak over and force me into a small space on my side.The pillow ensures I get my half of the bed!I like that the cover is removable and washable.This teether my daughter totally adores!!The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is beause it is on the heavy side, and many times my daughter has bonked herself in the face while lying on the ground or shaking it to make noise.Overall, it is a really cute teether, my daughter loves it, that to me is all that counts.It really serves more purpose as a rattle than anything else.(oh & our toy had no strange smell to it) Pretty happy with purchase.This toy is just the right size for him.He also loves the fact that it is a monkey.It is made of plastic, but it is like most Fisher Price toys.I didn't really think of this toy as a teether as much as it reminded me of a set of keys.I couldn't have bought this toy cheaper anywhere else!We used this swing a lot between newborn and around 6 months old, it's great because you can bring the baby in from the car and snap it right in the swing for a nap.The battery life is pretty good and our baby really liked the swing.It had to be on the highest setting as she got bigger and the noise was a little loud, but because it was so rhythmic it didn't bother her or us.A good product overall!This is just what we needed.Our son has acid reflux so he spends a lot of time sleeping in his car seat and getting swung to sleep in his seat.This is a pretty gentle swing, even at the highest setting, so it seems to get him to sleep a little better than his nice, Fisher Price swing.The portability of it is a big bonus.We're glad we'll have something other than our arms to get him to sleep whenever we travel.A good tip is to make sure it's stopped before you turn it on, turn it on, and then once you figure out how it's swinging to give it a little push in the right direction.Sometimes it has a little trouble with our big Graco seat and our chubby kid getting going.But once it does it doesn't stop!The complaints that it is too low to the ground -- DUH it's in the PICTURE -- are silly, because that's precisely WHY I like it -- it's easy to simply drop the car seat into the latch.And, it latches VERY easily, and you can tell immediately if it's in wrong so no worries about your wee one tipping off the base.I agree with the others who commented that, while making a sort of mechanical "clicking" sound, it is quiet and gentle, and actually puts MY baby to sleep.The selections for vibrations and songs (we love the ocean sounds) is soothing, and turns off automatically, which is convenient.As for the baby sitting in the car seat more -- we just bought one of the infant fleece bags, so it's just as comfortable as a "regular" swing seat.Lastly, to address the complaints that the swing does not move slow enough: my son hates when it's low anyway.I have not had to replace the batteries ONCE and I have been using it several times per week for four months.If you've got a small place, this is the swing for you.I hope mine lasts for the next.I am a mom of two kids, and I've tried many car seats over the years (I tried my friends' car seats before buying my own).Chicco KeyFit 30 is by far the best on the market!!!It's so easy to use, super comfy, and convenient to transfer between two cars.I took this seat to our local fire station for installation (even though installation here is a snap!there's even a level indicator for fool-proof job) - i just wanted to be sure I did it right.The supervisor there was raving to me how safe these car seats are, and how he wouldn't use anything else for his kids.They are a bit expensive, but when it comes to the safety of your kids... well, it's worth it.It was easy to install and the leveling feature on the base is very handy to have.I can also honestly say that I did not notice any toxic smell coming off of the seat, and I got it brand new and took it out of the plastic myself.As for the material that the seat is made of, no, it's definitely not the most breathable, but it is no worse than any other seat.I live in Texas and have AC in my car, and I haven't taken my baby out drenched in sweat on any occasion (and we have had a VERY hot summer).That being said, I do like the material on my Peg Perego Viaggio seat better, but only because it is softer and that seems to me like it would be more comfortable.If you are person that likes to put your car seat into a grocery cart (even though you know you're not supposed to), then do not get this seat.It will not sit securely in a grocery cart like a Graco will and if you set it in there you could risk serious injury to your child.We've been using this car seat for our little one for about a month.At this point I have nothing but praise for this seat.Initially we were comparing between this and the Britax Chaperone Carrier, Cowmooflage, but after test fitting the Chaperone in our full size truck with a full crew cab (and finding that it barely fit, and hung way off the seat beyond the 80/20 mark), we decided on the Chicco, and are glad we did.Safety:The car seat has great safety ratings, and scored well according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.It's very handy to be able to pop in/out of the base, without having to readjust the whole seat each time.In our case, we also purchased a second base, so we don't have to re-set everything up for each car.Just click to release, pop it in, do a pull check (to make sure it locked in) and go.The 5 point harness functions pretty similarly to other systems, so shouldn't be too bad to figure out.There are LOTS of hints/tips about the seat in there, and the most appropriate way to snug it for each scenario you might use it in.Non-Safety Features:The color is pretty cute (in Midori), and we do get comments on it, but overall, it's just the color, so it's not really the most important aspect of a car seat.The adjustable handle makes it nice to carry or prop the seat when out and about (folds under to stabilize it).The car seat bottom has a nice curve to it, so you can rock your little one to sleep while waiting in offices to keep them calm (GREAT feature).The base has a little compartment in it that you can store the manual and other related items in, and the detachable sun/rain hood are pretty good for keeping things dry and comfortable.For winter we'll be swapping it out with a home made cover for warmth.I can't recall the weight of the seat, but it's not too bad to manage.Side Benefit:After getting this, we also found out that it fit perfectly (unintentionally) with the Stroller we had picked out/received, the  Jeep Liberty Limited 3 Wheel All Terrain Stroller so we can just pop the seat in, secure it, and go.It may make all the difference.This car seat is ok, because my son gets too hot in it.It is November, cold and snowing and my son gets overheated.My husband and I love this car seat.One of the reasons we chose it is the fact that it does not require the base for installation.It also makes traveling in a friend's car with the baby a much more spontaneous thing.Our son is a long and skinny baby, and fits in the seat very well.My only two gripe points area: As other posters have noted, it does make him sweaty.b: it's very annoying that you have to push both orange releases at the same time to move the carrying handle.When the seat is in position in the middle of the back seat it takes some tricky contortions to get to the far side release button.Aside from these two small issues I feel like the quality of materials and construction is very high and would not hesitate to purchase the seat again.On a side note: We also use a BOB revolution stroller, and though not listed as a 'compatible' car seat with the infant car seat adapter, it fits just fine with the removal of a spanner bar (this is the same bar that has to be removed to turn the seat adapter into the snack tray feature, so it's designed to be removed anyway.)There is a more in depth tutorial on how to remove this bar in one of the BOB Revolution stroller reviews.there's not much more to say other than it's worth the money.we only purchased the car seat and wish we would have gotten the whole travel system.I really love this car seat.I've tried a few other car seats, and this is by far the easiest.The Graco Snugride seemed so flimsy to me and it was harder to get the belts adjusted properly.We have 3 of the bases in our 2 cars and in grandmas car.The seat is a little heavy, and I can see myself not being able to carry him in it for too much longer (he is 13 pounds).BEST carseat out there!The safety ratings are great.My son loves this carseat, falls asleep in it easily and looks very comfy.The first few weeks we had him home he would not sleep unless we held him, or snuggled into this seat.We were given the Chicoo Keyfit 30, which comes with one base.This carseat is a little heavier than a lot of the other ones we looked at, but if that's what it takes to make the amazing safety ratings, I'm okay with that.We did get a lighter carseat for my mom's car since she is getting older and the weight is more of an issue for her.Just a side note, in case anyone cares, the orange and gray version of this carseat has much softer fabric than many of the other colors.We have a VW 3 door hatchback and it fits perfectly.We even took it to get inspected to make sure that it would be properly installed and the clerk at the inspector office told me that this car seat is compatible with smaller vehicles.The installation was relatively easy and the car seat padding and plastic components look pretty high quality.I would certainly recommend this car seat for anyone with a smaller car who does not want to compromise on safety.Babies may outgrow this long before 30 pounds!My son is 18 pounds, and 29 inches tall, and is now too tall for the seat (It is rated for 30", or when his head is 2" from the top).This has been such a great car seat, I am so sad he outgrew it so quickly that we now have to buy a convertible one.*********original review, 6 months ago*********2 months along I'm pretty happy this was the biggest splurge in our baby purchases, and that we rearranged our budget for it (pricey car seat, secondhand baby clothes) rather than buying a cheaper car seat.Considering how long we'll use it, and that it's so highly rated for safety and ease of use, it made more sense than spending a lot elsewhere.The pros:-- Highly Rated by Consumer Reports-- Easy to use-- LOVE the newborn insert for babies under 10 lbs, since most aftermarket car seat additions for floppy newborns compromise the safety of the seat.-- The Adventure fabric is indeed more breathable than some others-- It is easy to rock the baby to sleep in it (not in the car of course).-- Little One seems very comfortable in it.-- We've had no problems with his head flopping around (from the size of 8.5 lbs, 21")-- Pops into the base easily-- Comes apart well for washing-- The handle is very comfy over the arm, being rounded.I have noticed a lot of car seats have handles with square edges.The cons:-- He does get a little bit sweaty in the seat (even though we ordered Adventure, which Chicco's customer service had said is a more breathable fabric).We combat this with a burp rag flat behind his back for one thin layer of wicking, and with a cloth (cotton) diaper with a wool cover (no synthetics).He gets very uncomfortable in it, with a disposable diaper or a PUL diaper cover.-- The canopy does not pull up or down well-- It's immensely annoying to have to push buttons on both sides of the handle, to move the handle-- No slot to set it on a grocery cart.The chicco car seats are great - easy to use, high safety ratings, and nice looking.Even after short rides in a well ventilated cool car his head totally soaks the head rest and the back of his shirt is totally soaked through.Both my daughters loved to fall asleep in it.One of the best purchases we've made!The stroller handles beautifully, and the car seat secures so sturdily!Yes, it has a lower weight limit than some, but when you install it and get your baby securely strapped in, that doesn't matter.I don't know if it's generated by the textiles or flame retardant, but it was overwhelming up close.It took about 2 weeks to air out, and gave our house a strong odor similar to "new car" smell.Not a terrible thing for adults in an open space, but I think putting a newborn immediately in the enclosed space of the car seat would have been questionable.I would not be comfortable with it.I'm not certain if the odor is specific to the Miro set or not, but I'd recommend future buyers plan ahead, make sure you give this set time to adequately breathe before you put your baby in it.You know that if Consumer Reports says this is the best, then it is, as CR will test every possible aspect of it, including the most important one: SAFETY!That is what I care the most when dealing with my baby, so if they say this is the best overall travel system that includes a stroller and car seat, I agree.It comes with EVERYTHING you need to use the car seat and stroller individually or together.It will hold your baby up to 30 pounds, which should be anywhere around his or her first year of life, which is good.Just wanted to throw that out there so that you know that they will help you if you needed it.I'm a big fan of Companies with good customer support, and this is one of them.The handle is adjustable and he can easily and comfortably push it at his height, as can I, and I imagine anyone could since it goes pretty far down.I contacted Chicco after seeing the stroller in stores and noticing that on some of them, the footrest did not lock into place in the flat position.That is because as of 2007, they stopped making the Cortina stroller in that way.It no longer locks in a flat position.I personally wanted this feature, so I did some negotiating with the personnel and swapped their barely used floor model stroller for the new one in the box.(I kept the new padding and carseat & just changed the stroller frame)  If you want this feature, know that you will probably not be getting it on this stroller any longer.No big deal.On that note, the difference between the Keyfit 22 and Keyfit 30, other than the obvious pound difference - you can use the Keyfit 22 car seat with a baby up to 22 lbs.and the Keyfit30 up to 30 lbs.-- is the fact that the Keyfit 30 has the lap belt system on the outside of the carseat, clearly visible, and the Keyfit 22 has it under the padding.If you ever need to use the car seat without the base, you can use a seatbelt with this system, just know that if you have a Keyfit 22 (not the one sold in this listing) you will have to remove the padding on the bottom sides of the car seat until it is visible and accessible.*The handle is foam padded so your hands won't get sweaty, but also has two flat rubbery grips for your hands.*The child tray is removeable for when you child is old enough to hop on him or herself.You can also just release one side of it.*The child tray also has a removeable click-in liner for easy cleaning.*The entire padding on both the stroller and car seat (except the canopy on the stroller) are removeable for washing.*The shoulder straps are removeable for older children.*The car seat comes with removeable padding for newborns in the seat and head area, so you don't need to purchase it separately and small babies will be snug & supported.After over a year of frequent use, it still functions like newWe just recently stopped using this system since our daughter has outgrown it, but we have another baby on the way and the stroller & travel system is still in great condition & has worn well - we'll be using it again!I highly recommend this product, it's worth the extra price.This travel system literally screams "GOOD DESIGN!"The Chicco Cortina is a winner in my book.We bought the stroller as we trusted Consumer Reports and wanted the best for our baby.Our 1-month-old fit the car seat, but when he got bigger, we had to transfer him onto the stroller and he doesn't fit in it (9-month-old).Our son had dermatitis that went away after switching to a bigger car seat.Now I see other reviewers wrote it could be linked to the fabric of the car seat.The bottom line:+ adjustable handle+ more or less easy to fold and place into the trunk- rides like a tank, very hard on bumps, so hard it wakes up our sleeping baby in the stroller-warning: do not place your coffee cup in the holder, it will spill on the bumps and burn your baby, I was lucky to have blanket over the top so it caught the spill-constantly squeaks, no matter how much WD40 you use!-no way you can push it in the snow, it just doesn't go-brakes are inconsistent, once they lock both of the wheels, the other time-just one-the straps are too loose, even in the tightest position-additional compartment next to the cup holder makes a loud clicking noise when opening, very annoyingI didn't want to pay more for better strollers, but now will pay double as I can't stand pushing this stroller anymore and looking into a different stroller.I do a lot of city walking.I hardly have time for reviews, but felt I had to leave this one.That is how bad I feel about the stroller.The car seat is a bit bigger/heavier, but honestly they are all heavy/bulky.#1 and the most irritating is when you have the infant seat snapped on the stroller (which is not hard at ALL, you just pop it in like you do with the carseat base in the car...of course you need to make sure the seat is reclined fully but it's like that with EVERY travel system out there) you can't easily reach the basket, at least not enough to get in/out of a diaper bag.It's open just enough where I can put some shopping bags with clothes in it.I can't really complain too much because this made me get a bag that I can attach to the handle of the stroller and I'm glad I did, it's so much easier than having to reach down under the stroller to get things.#2, it is hard to figure out how to open/close without reading the manual.So when I misplaced the manual and arrived at the mall for my first shopping trip after baby I could NOT figure out how to open the stroller.Later I went home and watched a youtube video review to figure it out.Now that I know how, it's so easy, but yes figuring it out when you are used to other types of strollers can be hard...just read the manual.My son is 7 weeks old (and 9lbs) and still fits in the car seat very well, he was 5.5lbs leaving the hospital and it fit well then too.I think we are about to move to the second strap setting, but remember when babies are rear facing the straps NEED to be below baby's shoulders.My husband installed it in December during a snowstorm in Wisconsin in the hospital parking lot in less than 5 minutes.I can only comment on using the stroller with the car seat so far, but it glides very smooth and easy.I can easily push it one handed while carrying a cranky baby.One more minor complaint that I almost forgot, the sunshade on the car seat is very small.Since it's winter I usually have a blanket over the car seat when we are outside anyways so this hasn't bothered me yet but I can see how it might become irritating.I bought this product based on consumer report's excellent review.This is a well built, easy to use and safe product for your kid.Sure there are cheaper alternatives available, but you wouldn't settle for those at the cost of your baby's safety, would you?The only suggestion I have to the manufacturer is to improve the documentation.None of their products were easy to put together (except car seat which doesn't need any assembly).This is the only stroller I've ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to.Very hard to steer, even with both hands.Forget using just one hand.I run into EVERYTHING in stores, and I'm constantly running over my husband's feet.-Sunshade doesn't cover well unless the back is in the most forward position.If you pull it down too hard, it causes the backrest of the stroller to lurch upright, pulling the baby with it.- Basket is way too high.Can't use the basket unless the back is completely upright.- Awkward handles make it feel like I can't get a good grip on the stroller.- The backrest is flimsy.It's easy enough to adjust it one handed.However, just slightly bumping it from behind causes it to lurch upright (again) pulling the baby with it.PROS:-The Chicco Keyfit carseat snaps into it.- Unfortunately, that's about it!I bought this stroller because I loved the pattern and I liked that I could snap in the car seat while my child was an infant.I have only put her in with the car seat, I've never put her directly in the stroller yet- she's 2 months old.I can't review that part yet.Mainly just the wheels, shade and tray needed to be put on.It's very easy to fold and open; I can almost do it one handed.There's a latch to keep it closed.It's not the strongest latch I could imagine, but it's worked for me so far and I've never had a problem with it.This stroller rolls really well.I've used it on pavement as well as grass for short periods and I've never had an issue.It's not easy to push with one hand because it has two individual handles, but it's not impossible.I like having the two handles actually because it's great for looping bags over.Since you need to recline it to get the car seat attached, that renders the basket useless while she's in it.That's the main reason it got four stars, rather than five.The only other reason I gave it four stars is because when you fold it to travel, the sunshade pops off on one side (I had seen someone else make the same complaint).It's not a huge problem, it's just annoying to put back on every time.The only problem is that it's often too dark to see in side, particularly if you're using the car seat because that makes the inside very dark to begin with.Also, you have to have the sunshade fully extended to even begin to see inside.I actually use that as a drink holder even though it's too big because I don't feel like taking the cup holder with me.Overall, I like this stroller and would buy it again.But there is room for improvement.UPDATE: My daughter is now 18 months old and about 24#.She still fits the stroller very well.I still am happy with the purchase, but there are a few things I've learned would have been nicer over the last year.I wish the basket under the seat (for diaper bags, jackets, etc) were bigger and easier to get to.It's pretty small by comparison to friends' strollers and it's a pain to get to.Best for a short, narrow cup.I would also like if it folded out of the way better.That's been a nice change.The seat reclines pretty far, but not totally flat.It holds a jacket or a blanket or a (sealed) cup.He doesn't sleep in the bassinet because he sleeps much better in the swing or carseat, but he is very happy to lie there and look at the dangling animals for a little while.I do not have to keep a hand on him at all times, which is very nice when I have to grab something.It is easy to drag from one room to another.CONS:  I can't really feel the vibrations (when I put them on) in the bassinet sleeping area - but who knows, maybe my baby can.I looked at some of the others that had the changing table attached to the end of the pNp and I don't know how comfy I would feel putting my child in that.Overall, definately 5 stars.The only suggestion I have to the manufacturer is to improve the documentation.None of their products were easy to put together (except car seat which doesn't need any assembly).Just got this pump and have used it a couple times.It gets the job done, so I'll keep it, but it's not as versatile as the company claims.I'll caveat that by saying it's the only one I've tried, so I have no basis for comparison.There are two controls, "cycles" and "suction."The description makes it sound like there are several cycles settings so you can mimic your baby's style in order to facilitate let-down.Unfortunately, there's not a big difference between the lowest and highest setting, and the highest cycle doesn't come close to how quickly my baby sucks to start let-down.Suction is also markedly different between the two units.I found that when pumping both at once, I had to switch sides/units to even out the pumping.One had about half the power as the other.The motor is not discrete, and it does beep, but it's not distractingly loud.UPDATE: This pump DOES fit standard Evenflo plastic and glass bottles, which is very convenient -- no need to pump into the storage unit and then transfer to the bottle.I love this pump!It's not complete quiet, but the noise that it does make is really not that bad.I recommend this pump to everyone.This pump set does the job and is easy to use.It's nice that you have the option of pumping either one or both breasts.A potential solution to this problem would be to just buy a harness and make it hands-free.I recommend a harness anyway, because it's a pain in the butt having to hold the pumps against your body the entire time anyway.I was trying to decide between Ameda and Medela.I heard great reviews on both so it came down to price.I'm glad I went with Ameda.This pump worked great.Very easy to clean.I used this pump a lot as I was having problem with breast feeding.I don't know what I would have done without the Ameda pump.This is a great pump if you only need it from time to time.I bought mine brand new and had no problem using both pumps at the same time.I used it a few times each day, five times a week.The pump completely stopped working in May; which means it had only been used for 9 months.I called Ameda customer service, but my warranty had expired in March, one year after the purchase date.I was told that I could buy a new motor for $120, which was out of the question.Also, the zipper broke on my carrying case.I purchased a used one online, needing the pump and carrying case.Unfortunately, right away, I noticed that the pump was weak.It only allowed me to pump one at a time...and wasn't overly efficient.As my milk supply dwindled due to weaning, it got to the point that manual expression produced more than the pump could, so it was useless.I'm now getting ready to go back to work after my 2nd child.I've used the pump a couple times and the motor is definitely dying on me.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it lasts awhile.After reading other reviews about how the Medela seems to last longer and pumps more efficiently, I'm wondering if I'm making the wrong purchase.After this 3rd purchase, I'll now have spent about $200 on pumps, which leads me to believe I should have just gone with the Medela in the first place.Also, what do I do with 2 dead pumps and all of the extra parts & accessories??????Also, it does seem a bit loud though I can't compare it to other brands, having not heard those.While pumping in the lactation room at work, I felt the need to cover it up with my shirt or a towel to muffle the sound a bit.I used this pump from when my baby was 3 days old to when he was 2.5 months.Then I upgraded to the much pricierMedela Freestyle Breast Pump, and I haven't used it since.I found it difficult to maintain milk supply with the Ameda pump while working full-time.Two weeks after I returned to work, I was ready to give up on feeding my child breastmilk exclusively.As a last-ditch effort, I switched to the Medela Freestyle.So I would say that the Ameda pump is fine if you are pumping just a bit, but if you're pumping more than you are breastfeeding, you may be better off with a more efficient pump.Before this we had a spreadsheet printout out to track feeding times, which breast, etc but now just use this.It's more useful then you would think, but once youre sleep deprived and trying to remember when was the last time you changed baby's diaper or which breast she used to feed baby last.I think this is a must have for new moms!I always had it within arms reach those first few weeks; so nice for timing feeding and for knowing when I could take my pain medication.Once my baby was old enough I started feeding him on demand, so I didn't really need this anymore, although I do now use it to time how long he sleeps at night.I was tempted to purchase a new one since mine had the button issues, but while that is annoying, it's still functional.Couldn't have lived without it those first few weeks, and I still prefer it to an app (the simplicity of hitting a flashing button in the midst of a sleep-deprived night is so much nicer than having to swipe, hit the icon for the app, and hit the icon to start a feeding timer).They tried several times to figure it out... way too complicated for a timer.The Itzbeen timer is a fairly simple device that isn't really worth 25 dollars but is very helpful in keeping track of diapering, etc when you are busy with more then one child or are sleep deprived.I had a preemie and had to pump every few hours and I also had a 2 year old son that needed to go on the potty often so I used the timer for both and it was so helpful.I buy the Itzbeen for every friend of mine that has a baby.There's a nightlight so you can check on the little bugger, too.A nursing switch will remind you which breast you nursed last, as well.I learned my baby's schedule without having to make one up and try to have him accommodate my assumptions about him.It got down to a science.For instance, At one point, I knew that my baby could stay awake between 1 hr and 14 minutes and 1 hour and 21 minutes and after that, it would be much more difficult for him to fall asleep.2.I learned my baby's cries very quickly.When my parents would babysit, I wouldn't have to give a long explanation about what's been happening.Just handed over the ItzBeen.The ItzBeen is way better than the iphone app.It's simpler and only addresses how long ItzBeen since the last act, so you don't have an account of every single thing you've done with your baby since he's been born.Believe me, you'll never need that much information!You just need an ItzBeen.I really can't say enough about this timer.When you first come home from the hospital with a new baby, everything's so new and there's so much you have to do every 2-3 hours around the clock.Eventually, at least in my case, it's hard to keep track of time.Sleep deprivation, hormones, and the the learning curve all take a toll.This thing is so simple to use.It never left me the whole time I was on maternity leave.It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it does do, it does extremely well.I have to say that now at 2 months we use it alot less.After his birth, my brain was malfunctioning a lot and I was nursing him every two hours and this helped.Besides that, I did not find any other use for it.2.Diaper Indicator: Who cares when you last changed your baby's diaper?If it is wet or soiled, change it.His diapers had a little yellow line on the front that would turn blue when wet.Nap Indicator: Infants don't have napping schedules, they sleep when they sleep, so this function was useless to me.Whatever You Want Indicator: I didn't use this for anything.Often I would sit down to nurse and realize that I left the Itzbeen in the living room and end up not pushing the button.Eventually, I just stopped using it all together and resorted to having a scrap of paper and a pen in all my nursing locations.I definitely used this for times in between feedings, other than that it wasn't useful.The left and right sides toggle are very useful as well!!!Update: Now at baby's 3 month mark we no longer use it at all.We're keeping it because we could see a use  in the future for it...When I initially saw the Itzbeen it looked like a waste of money, but I am a sucker for gadgets so I put it on my registry.I am so glad that I did.Those first few weeks of motherhood are far more sleep deprived and emotionally exhausting than I could have imagined.When your newborn is feeding every two hours and you haven't had more than 90 minutes of sleep in a stretch, it's comforting to have a little blinky companion that knows for sure how long it's been since that diaper was changed and when the last time the little one ate was.I odered this timer when I was still in the hospital after having our daughter because it didn't take very long for us to realize that trying to keep track of everything on paper was exhausting.It was waiting for us when we got home, and we both love it!Most of the time, I didn't even know what time the last time was that she ate or was changed, just how long it had been.It's so useful for those fussy times when you're trying to figure out what baby needs.I really love this product for anytime that I went outside our home.I was able to plan trips to the grocery store better because I knew approximately how long I had until my daughter would want to eat again, and I could set the alarm so I wouldn't lose track of time.Do yourself a favor if your expecting, and get one of these to have from day one!Definitely a worth while product!I got a lot of things at my baby shower but this was the most useful for a new born.You can set timers for diaper changes, naps, meals, etc so it takes the guess work out of when things when done, which my husband loved because he could just look at it and see what needs to be done when he came home from work.I breastfeed so the little switch at the bottom that keeps track of which side you used last was a life saver.I am a first time mom and had no idea how hetic things would be so this was a HUGE help.I have used this for my last two kids...and I couldn't live without it.I find it the most useful in the hospital when you have no clue wether you are coming or going..AND you can time how long you have slept and most importantly, when you can get your next dose of pain meds.Saves so much hassel!When you are home, it's also so useful since the baby is sleeping alot and you may not know (esp.if you have other kids) how long it's been since the last feeding and if you have to wake the baby or not.Of course you are still feeding ondemand, but my babies always slept thru alot of the feedings so I would know it would be time to wake them up.I was so busy with the other kids I wouldn't have known how long it was.I am also using it to help me realizw how many hours of sleep sI am getting at night.Again, I have to get up with the other kids, and I can't sleep with the baby, so the timer is PRICELESS in helping me know how long I've been asleep.The nightlight and backlight are so helpful.I have too many other things going on and this helps me keep track.Even though she ate every 3 hours, so many times I couldn't remember what time it was when she last had a bottle.I didn't really use it for any of the other features because I changed her diaper at every feeding unless she pooped.I got this preowned off an auction site.Especially the first couple months when I didn't know what time it was, when I last nursed, what side it was done on, or how long my little girl slept for.Especially when I was nursing and wanted to know how long my little one was on each side.And how long it's taking to put her to bed and so forth.Now that the little lady is older I use it to remind me when I gave her medicine and as a nightlight as I put her to bed.I almost returned this before I opened it, but I'm glad I didn't.I don't much care how long its been since junior had his diaper changed, but I definitely track his feedings.If I'm at home, it helps us manage our time so that I'm prepared for a feeding instead of being in the middle of cooking dinner or something.It also helps me to see that if he is fussy after 2 hours, it isn't likely hunger.I like to see how long he sleeps, but really it doesn't matter.But the asterisk button is helpful when administering meds.After having immunizations, they suggested Tylenol every 6 hours.In the beginning I used the switch to remember what side I nursed on last, but I've gotten lazy at that.The only reason for the missing star...the nightlight button now sticks and is very difficult to press and turn on..which is very frustrating at 2 a.m.Overall, I recommend this for anyone who likes to stick to a schedule.If you prefer to wing it, don't bother!After using the timer for a couple of weeks, I can see why it gets rave reviews.Sleeping in 2 hour increments is not particularly conducive to remembering things.We registered for this product but then removed it from our registry as we thought it probably wasn't totally necessary and a little gimmicky.After a few days home from the hospital we promptly ordered this product!We tried writing down last feeding times and such but when you're a walking zombie writing down the times didn't always happen and then even if it did figuring out how long it had been/math on no sleep is not easy!So do yourself a favor and start out with this product!The only thing I wish it did was count feedings/diapers in a 24 hour period as that is one of the things they tell you to count in the beginning.I purchased this as a first-time mom who was previously a very organized career woman.It was the biggest help in tracking when the last diaper change, feeding, and nap was.I also ended up using it to track the last time I'd taken various medications for a couple weeks after I had major surgery.It can count the time up or down.I mainly used it to count up, similar to a stopwatch.I like that it stays put, it matches the regular toilet by being white (so hopefully less confusion later) and has the "splash guard" in the front, especially since we have a boy.Won't be disapointed and it will last for more than one child.My son is 2 1/2 and had no trouble ripping these door knob covers right off!I will say that the actual mechanism for squeezing and turning the knob is good; he can't do that.What he can do, however, is pull the two halves of plastic apart and take the knob cover clean off.But, since these were so inexpensive, I guess I shouldn't have expected too much.A little home engineering and I have gotten them to work for us: duct tape.Taping the cover around the knob keeps it from being popped apart and removed.Now it is securely on the knob, spins when he tries to turn it, and has the little tabs that I can squeeze through the tape and open the door.In short, if you don't mind having to alter the product a little, it can work.But, if you're planning to put them on every door knob in your house, I wouldn't recommend them.If they do, buy more.But if they don't, you'll feel silly with 16 doorknob covers lying around.These barely work on our doorknobs, but our doorknobs are slightly oddly shaped.I find the tabs on the sides frustrating to use, but that may be due to the odd doorknob shape as well.The one thing i really don't like about these is that the little tab to cover any locking mechanism has become my toddler's new favorite toy.I'm pretty sure that wasn't the point.Nothing fancy or expensive, just does it's job, aids and doesn't get in the way.Happy dad of juice lovers.I thought this product would work better but my 22 month old just takes the juice box out of it defeating the whole purpose of it.I only buy the 4 ounce juice boxes and this container is too big for it.She loves to drink Capri Sun drinks and squeezes them every time.My problem is now solved.I haven't tried it with box drinks yet, but think it will do fine as long as they are not the smaller ones.My child can now drink a bag drink without squirting it everywhere.The Capri Sun drinks fit very well into the bag.I got the green one...it's just not a pretty color to me!Love giving my kids juice boxes when we're out and about - don't love them squeezing the juice all over themselves and their car seat.This totally did the trick and saved the day.I have 4 of them and keep them everywhere, just in case.They make it way easier for little hands to enjoy their drink.I'm not sure what someone was complaining about with them chipping, etc.I've had mine for ages and throw them in the dishwasher and they don't have a mark.Don't throw it off a cliff and it should be fine!For $2 you can't beat it!Even though they're expensive I got these because I wanted black corner cushions.Stone table with wooden legs.Glass entertainment center.Ceramic tile surround/hearth on our fireplace.The trouble is, most of the stores only carry a beige or offwhite color, and our decor is more black.Fortunately, we found these cushions on amazon in black.They are great quality, very cushiony and of sufficient length to be able to cut to any application.The included double-sided tape is not useful.Doesn't hold very well, etc.So, we found reviews of this "peal and seal" weatherize caulk.Which is designed to be temporary for sealing windows.It's sticky enough to hold the cushion in place, and can be peeled off the surfaces easily enough without leaving a mark.These bumpers are a great find, and the best price is, of course, on Amazon.For the first few days my son kept trying to chew it but quickly gave up since it was no longer cold and hard.There is no visible damage from him chewing and it still sticks great.As another reviewer mentioned it says it's not for hearths but like her I'm sure that's a flammability issue and like her we don't use the fireplace anyway.Edit -I just wanted to add that when we put our house on the market we removed this and it came off cleanly.If I ever need it again I'll be able to use it (just need more adhesive).Its a good product other then its an ugly color!I ordered this before realizing that it came in black also.So I have both on my living room furnature.Again it didnt come with enough tape, i guess you can buy more seperate.I bought these in conjunction with theKidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions - 8 Pack.And unlike the corner pieces, these ones stick down quite well and have given me no problem.By contrast, the corner pieces stuck well at first, but over time, seem to be popping off all on their own.The cushions are great in and of themselves, but the double sided tape used to stick them down isn't.But I'm still happy with the purchase and will just stick them down better with better tape or glue.I have sensitive legs and have bumped into my low coffee table corners several times, and I know these have saved me months of recovery time.Also, the tape is not as good as the Lionheart brand which comes with wider, precut 3m glue tape.My bigger problem with it is that it's hard, and not soft like most other pacifiers, so his face can get red while sucking on this.In addition, it also left an indentation around his lips because of the tension.Overall it's a great idea, but it didn't do well for me.We purchased this gate after reading the reviews here and have been very happy with this purchase.Our cat has only once jumped the gate but that was after she snuck in when the gate wasn't latched and I caught her roaming around.I think I scared her into jumping over the gate in order to get out of our room!I called Kidco Customer Support and they graciously sent me another latch replacement.More than enough for my 225lb and 6'1 frame to fit thru - but that is where the positives end...The latch to unlock it feels cheap and flimsy.It feels almost like the plastic youd buy a gallon of milk in.When pulling up on the latch, you have to lift the gate up over that inch (doesnt sound like much but the others we have tried you only lift up a little bit and its unlocked.This bottom bracket also causes trouble when it shuts, which i might add does not automatically shut.I was shutting the gate door, and noticed that i several times had to stop for an extra amount of time to ensure the bottom bracket was aligned correctly to the frame.It was a cumbersome process and wasnt what i wanted if i was in a hurry.Other gates just have a metal pin that hangs down, that when it meets the bottom of the frame it simply slides in and shuts very easily.Another feature i just could stand at ALL, was the fact that if you have the gate door open half way and it isnt in the "lift up position", you have to lift it up again.Its kind of odd to describe in this review.oh yea - the supposed stainless steel extension connecting bars were RUSTED when they came!i pulled the first two out, and they were fine.the other two were totally rusted.Its just nothing at all what we want and i am surprised how many good reviews this has.I think it's ok. Based on the reviews I thought that this would be an awesome choice but its a little boring for my taste plus, my little girl doesn't care for it.i decided to run out to the dollar store and buy some little cards with shapes and colors on it and have her match them all up and she seemed to enjoy those much more.Tempted by the low price and promising design, my wife and I purchased this potty trainer seat.They weren't kidding when the product description notes "colors may vary" as ours arrived in a rather hideous shade of pink instead the attractive blue color shown.We could have lived with the color though had the seat been functional; alas it did not fit either  of our normal, regular toilet seats.I highly recommend not purchasing this product.I already had a Baby Bjorn toilet seat but he didn't seem to like it.I thought this one might be better since it seems like it would be a little more enclosed around his body and maybe make him feel more secure while sitting up high on the toilet.TO use this seat you have to lift up the regular toilet seat and position this one the rim of the toilet, then lower the toilet seat back down over it.Not difficult but you have to be careful not to let it slide down into the toilet bowl.This also means that to take it off you have to do the same thing.A lot more work than my Baby Bjorn where you just lift it right off.On our toilet, the seat shifted a lot.There isn't any way to secure it to the toilet like there is with the Baby Bjorn.The only thing holding it on is the actual toilet seat itself so there is no way to stop the shifting.Another thing I found out was that my son couldn't get onto this seat alone.I recommend putting your money into the Baby Bjorn seat.I have never reviewed before on Amazon but felt that I needed to review this product b/c I am really unhappy with the quality and what you get for the high price.Please take this into consideration.I wanted BPA free bottles and decided to register for these.I already threw one bottle out and realized that the others are leaking too.I am tired of the rings around the bottle when I pick it up.I have to clean my coffee table and desk after using this bottle and am not happy that formula is getting on the wood surface.For the price of the bottle, I shouldn't have to put something under it before setting it on the table or use another brand's nipple.I am going to try Playtex.They are BPA free and cheaper even though you have to buy the liner-they are BPA free too.They are a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.These bottles NEVER LEAK!!!Which is the most important factor for me.I have only good things to say about these bottles after trying many others.They even fit in my Avent bottle warmer.Every child is different so to say one is better than another is silly.I can say that these nipples held up well (we did not replace every 3 months as recommended) and the flow stayed as desired throughout the life of the product (more like 6 months).My baby girls JUST turned 6 months old literally this week.We were needing to change our new nipples out anyway so we decided to try them on the stage 3 nipples.They had no problem whatsoever.The flow seems to be just right for the and it cuts feeding time down so much!They can finish their 6 oz in 10 min.which is great for mom and dad since they don't have holding their own bottles down just yet.All babies are different but for us they worked just great.Alright first time mom here.We added some rice to the bottle and it would not come out fast enough for our baby.We tried the Y-Cut but this was horrible.Okay, here is the biggest problem I see with 80% of the negative reviews-- this cup is SUPPOSED to "leak."In no uncertain terms, the product is billed as "free-flowing."Which, to me, and I think my English teachers would all agree, means drip, drip, drip.If you are looking for a leak-free sipper, keep looking.If you are angry that the sipper leaks, I would suggest that you read the full product description before you buy.These sippers are basically identical in appearance to the Born Free TRAINER cup, which does not leak.As an aside, I will also offer up this bit of information-- it takes nothing short of a commercial vacuum to get liquid out of those spouts, but my son is very fond of the shape, hence I bought one of these, and everyone is more or less pleased.The reason these get one star reduction is that the cost of the cup is highway robbery-- if, like me, you have invested a small fortune in sippers, trying to find one your child will accept, $10+ is really too much.Yes, you can purchase the replacement spouts, but here I will let you in on another bit of interesting information-- the collar and spout do not make the fantastic seal that they do when you buy the pre-packaged cup-- why?!?I do not mind leaking from the spout tip, where liquid is supposed to come from, but around the collar is unacceptable.My other minor complaint is that the handles are cheaply made-- they are quite flimsy and after a few uses/washes, they "spin" around the sipper as they please.When baby picks up the sipper with one hand (which they will eventually do), the sipper may come crashing down at their face.of liquid, but it's enough to make even the bravest toddler cry for their mommy.Note: Unless your child has a VERY strong suck, I would recommend bypassing the trainer spout and going directly to these-- yes, they will leak, but baby won't get blue in the face from sucking or throw it down in disgust (because they aren't able to get anything out).I would recommend getting the drink cup spouts instead.The holes are much to small in these spouts, rendering them useless.We tried these for a few weeks when it looked like our son was ready to move on from the standard bottle.The flow was simply not good enough and the green ones flowed to fast.In the end we just broke down and bought sippy cups with diaphragms (which really aren't that expensive)and put these in storage.Kind of a cool idea to utilize your existing bottle system but ultimately not a great substitute.A sippy cup that won't leak milk onto my carpet.If your child drops his/her sippy cup the contents will dripple onto your floor--if you're okay with this then by all means buy these.I cannot chase my daughter around with a carpet cleaner everytime she drinks from her cup.Yes, I have also just made her sit at her high chair and drink it but at the end of the meal there was more milk on the floor and high chair than in her mouth.Waste of money!Like the other reviewers, make sure you are buying the trainer cup, not the sippy cup and you won't have leak/spill issues!She drinks from this easily and likes that she can hold it.Its allowed my husband and I to have a date night again!We've been using the Born Free bottles for the past few months and they've worked our really well - except, as I'd read in another review elsewhere, I don't know if I see a point to that vent insert.It's pretty annoying.And because I'd read the reviews about leakage, I decided to also buy the Think Baby Sippy Cup Trainer, as well, to compare the two.I used Think Baby first and LOVED it.No leaks at all.AND no annoying vent insert to deal with, either.Then I tried the Born Free trainer after, and it leaked IMMEDIATELY.That stupid vent insert.Seeing as these cups aren't exactly cheap, I'm going to return this one and get a few more of the Think Baby cups.It's not a horrible leaker, but a bit more other brands I've tried.Have you ever tried to drink from a normal sippy-cup?The little plastic valve-thing that keeps it from spilling everywhere makes it extremely difficult.I tested a few that we've ended up with, and i'm just astonished that any child can drink from them.He's constantly teething.Second, he can actually drink more than three drops before giving up in frustration.Third, when he does drink an ounce or do in one go, when he takes his mouth off the spout, there's not the great sucking sound of pressure equalizing.I'm not sure how the little plastic rings allow air to get in to replace the milk he drinks, but they work.I'm a little baffled by some of the low-star reviews for this product.There are two major categories of complaint: leaking, and difficulty drinking.The only way we've been able to get the cup to leak are as follows: leaving out the vent rings when assembling the cup, or mashing the spout into things while upside-down.Now that my son has chewed on them all extensively, some will let an occasional drip of milk out if you hold them upside-down, but not enough to damage the hardwood.(Also, the cap covers the opening in the spout, and i've never had the cup leak at all with the cap on, even sideways in the diaper bag.)As for difficulty drinking, it's surely not as easy as drinking from a cup that isn't concerned with leaks, but it's so much better than standard sippy cups that the comparison is almost meaningless.---I feel a little silly editing this review two days after posting it, but i just ordered two more of these, and something changed.The two new ones leak generously.If you hold them upside-down, they downright dribble.Further, with the cap on, the spout isn't stoppered, so the cap fills up with milk if it's not upright.(The cap makes a tight seal, so the milk doesn't leak everywhere.If you're not paying attention and open the cap, though, you will make a mess.)They're still much easier to drink out of than standard sippy cups, but i can't toss these into a bag like i could the first few i ordered.I'm not sure what changed; they look identical to the older ones, but they're not.I didn't understand when to change the nipples.Our daughter started sucking so hard on the nipple that it would flatten in her mouth.We use the stage 3 for bottle with rice mixed in.I have owned a kidco storage basket for 2 years now and i must say i can't imagine my bathtub without it.It keeps all of my sons bath toys stored and drained, safely and out of the way until bath time.This was such a good idea.Also, we could only use it in the back of the tub as ours in contoured in the front by the spout.It now sits on the floor by the tub and I keep a towel under it to soak up the water from the toys.This organizer is simply one of the best purchases I have ever made.It is simple and non-obtrusive, simply adjusting to fit over your bathtub, resting on the sides.If you do not have flat sides to your bath tub, this may not work for you.It has dividers, so you can create separators between, say, soap and shampoo, and toys.We use it to store the rubber duckies, shampoo, soap, and so forth.I usually try to avoid buying too many baby products that I don't really need it, but this one - is a total must for a clean and organized bathroom.It fits all of her toys and her shampoo and soap.I'm able to fit two GumDrop pacifiers in this pouch and slip it into my diaper bag or purse, it's very handy.I haven't had a problem with the pocket detaching or falling off of my bag, I use a Skip Hop diaper bag with two interior key hooks, and I attach the pacifier pocket to one of those.I can also maneuver the zipper with one hand, which is always nice when you have an infant in your arms.This seems like a handle pouch for a pacifier but I can only do it if it's in a plastic sandwich baggie.The concept is convenient but just seems so unsanitary to me.I bought a different brand pacifier pocket first and it did not zip closed and I was always loosing pacifiers and they were getting dirty because the design of the pocket was awful.Now that I have this one I am much happier!I can fit two pacifiers in it and zip it closed.I will be ordering another one - as you can't have enough of these for clean and secure pacifier storage!My husband refused and it seriously took us an hour to put it together b/c things kept turning out to be backwards, etc.Then when we went to roll it into our bedroom, it wouldn't fit through the door!It wasn't a problem for us that it wouldn't fit through the door, because all of the bedrooms in our house were upstairs, but if we'd been on one floor, I would have wanted to be able to move this from room to room without breaking it down.The sounds and lights are great but the battery dies quickly.I think we changed ours every few weeks.It has a cute hood that we do not use much.The only reason I do not give it 5 star is because the diaper holder kept falling off.And it is hard to put sheets on the mattress pad because the pad folds and tucks into the corners in a very awkward way.We conquered the potty with this stool!My daughter is short and has one leg that is very short so using the standard Baby Bjorn stool (which we have 2 of) just isn't broad or tall enough to enable her to be self sufficient.Within a few minutes of using this, the wire that holds the bristles and sponge on the handle bent.It then twisted around in the handle so I wasn't able to clean bottles well.The plastic end meant to clean nipples was a joke.It didn't clean anything.It is slender, which makes it easier to fit in the bottles.The sponge on top disintegrates over times, but I guess that's bound to happen.not very well made for durability.The suction cup seemed kind of pointless too - it doesn't hold well enough to be on a counter surface.I wonder if perhaps there was a bad batch that went out in stores??I find the stand very handy and the nipple cleaner connected to the handle is highly functional!The sponge part is tearing and wearing out, but I have tried other baby bottle brushes that did the same thing so I suppose that comes with the territory.I love this brush and find it handy and functional and will continue to buy only these Dr. Brown's brushes until my child outgrows the bottle!A must have for cleaning your bottles.It gets the bottles the cleanest.The only thing that I didn't like was that the top green sponge part does not hold up.Excellent product and great price!I keep a set in her diaper bag for just "in case" she needs a toy and another set at home.These links are very fun- most of the links have little animals on them.They are also useful for hanging things from carriers/strollers, etc.She does like playing with them but the paint is coming off because she is biting them so i have put them away for when she is older and past putting everything in her mouth.I found these blocks at my daughters daycare and ordered a set for myself.I really like the look (looks like real blocks) and my daughter now knows the animals and the sounds that they make.She loves to stack and knock over.I have a baby bjorn too, and that hurts my neck and shoulders, but the moby wrap distributes the weight really well.My 6 month old loves sitting in it in the "hug" hold and the sitting out (looking out) hold.I've worn him for 2-3 hours at a time before... he just falls asleep.and the wrap works as advertised but my little guy only likes it for short periods of time and won't fall asleep in it so it hasn't worked out as well as I had hoped.Still, it is a quality made product and think it is worth a try... and definitely felt safer than any of the other slings I tried in the stores.Being to able to hold my baby but still have my hands free to do other things is amazing!I am writing this review with my baby sleeping in the wrap.My baby was premature so he is still pretty small.I am sure that I will use this as his grows.I was never able to get a tight enough wrap, no matter what I did.I ordered this because my baby was having problems with the Beco carrier we had.She fussed every time we put her in it.So I thought I would try this.Personally, I thought it was hard to get the hang of and hard to get my baby in comfortably.She started to like the Beco after awhile and I stopped using this.The Moby Wrap is one of my family's favorite baby products.Our newborn daughter (our second child) loves it--she falls asleep in the hug hold or cradle hold 7 times out of 10.We also have an Ergo baby carrier that we bought before our daughter was born.We thought we could use it for a newborn but discovered that it was not ideal for our newborn (not enough head support and no place for her legs in the upright hold--the only hold she liked for the first several weeks of her life).We instead had a generic ring sling and a Baby Bjorn.Both products were extremely disappointing.If I were advising parents-to-be, I would say the only carrier you need to start out with is the Moby Wrap.If you can master the tying (YouTube has several very good clips), it should serve you well for a long time.And then later if you find that the stretchy material that was so great for creating a comfy nook for your 7.5lb newborn is now too droopy with a 22lb toddler, at that point buy the Ergo.As a 1st time parent (couselor and avid reseacher) I new the importance of day-time sleep but I just couldn't get her to stay asleep in her crib during the day (Thank God that was not the case at night...largely due to being swaddled in a Miracle Blanket...one of my other favorite baby products).I would wear her after her morning feeding and changing and she would be asleep in 15 min tops freeing me up to eat breakfast, pay bills, do some light cleaning.I wanted her to have as much contact as possible before I had to go back to work at 8 weeks.She is almost 10 months old now and I still wear her.I can run the sweeper and do other things around the house.My husband even broke down and put it on a couple times despite the fact he said it was a little too feminine for him.He prefers the bjorn.My little one is ok with bjorn now but she wasn't when she was little.With the moby, you can tuck their little heads in and they don't go anywhere.She flopped around too much in the bjorn at first.(Bjorns are also waaaaaay more $$$$ than Moby).A couple other things: 1.)I learned to stuff a burp cloth btwn me and the baby for 2 reasons (1.)spit-up(duh).A barrior btwn the skin was helpful for this.Watch some YouTube videos for further instruction on wearing.It is easy once you get the hand of it.He fell asleep rather quickly every time, and stayed that way.I've only used it at home but I could see where using it out and about might be a hassle.I'd definitely say you need to put it on before leaving the house, even if it's not time to wear baby yet.I'm disappointed with the Moby because after only one wash it shrunk significantly.I washed on a short cycle by itself in cold water, and then dried it by itself on ultra low heat.When I went to wear it after the wash, the ends are shorter by several inches and I can barely knot it properly at my hips/waist.(I'm a fairly average postpartum size at 5'6" and 160 pounds) I'll continue to use the product for the time being, but as my son gets bigger there isn't enough room left to adjust to his size so I will be shopping around for a different carrier.I am getting ready to use my Moby with baby #2 and am soo looking forward to it.I also own an Ergo, several pouch slings, and a ring sling.This was my favorite for those days when I was home for most of the day doing chores (laundry, anyone?).For anyone considering purchasing or trying out a Moby or similar wrap, I highly reccomend YouTube as a resource.I am also fortunate enough to live in an area where there is a shop that sells wraps and can give hands on instruction; I know in some areas there are baby-wearing groups as well.Great for extended baby wearing.-Baby felt very secure in the wrap, head did not flop around even when leaning over unlike pretty much every other carrier.That said, I would always watch to make sure that his head did not flop around and would occasionally use a hand to support his head.ALWAYS monitor your baby in any carrier, it is not safe to ignore your baby and assume everythng is okay!-Holds the baby in an upright position, great if your baby has problems with reflux.-I never had a problem feeling overheated with the Moby, even though I had a summer baby.Words of caution:-The Moby and other wrap carriers take some practice and patience.I found the best way to wrap my baby was to hold him to me and wrap the carrier around him rather than starting with the carrier wrapped and trying to get him in it.This way I was able to get the fit more snug where it was most needed.I would then leave the wrap tied around me for the day basically and pull my son in & out as needed.This is pretty key to using the wrap and avoids the dreaded "tails in the dust" problem that this carrier can have.However, putting the baby in an already tied carrier was just never quite as good as the first tie, which is why I also loved my pouch & ring sling- these are much easier to get baby in & out so are great for out & about.-As with any carrier, the first use should occur when baby is relatively happy.Don't try this out on a crying or fussy baby if you have another way to calm him/her.Having a helper for the first use is also nice.-This wrap IS a lot of fabric.That said, I never had any trouble getting it folded up and back into the pouch.I can't remember if I tied the tail in front or in back but either way it didn't seem like a big deal.-There is no way my husband would ever have used it.He had a pouch sling, which he loved.But I was the one at home with the new baby all day still trying to feed myself and use the toilet occasionally (and remember the laundry?Of course, if you do buy it and don't like it, there is always resale.Think of all the baby stuff you have just invested in, all the clothes that will be outgrown after only one (or no) wearings, the swing the baby just didn't like, etc.As parents we invest a lot of money and time into things that simply don't work out.Some babies are apparently fine laying in their carseats all day, if this is your baby then maybe the Moby is not for you.But if your baby is colicky, or wants to be held constantly and you can't figure out how you are going to go to the toilet, let alone make dinner while you balance a baby, isn't the Moby worth a try?No, it will (probably) not single-handedly save your sanity, but neither will that expensive whatever it is that you had to have while you were pregnant.It is another tool in the toolbelt, and for me 4-5 months of two-handed productivity was worth the learning curve and initial intimidation.I really like this wrap.Seriously, all that fabric wrapped around me and the babay...way too much bulk and body heat.My son got a heat rash from being in it.I'd opt for either a sling for young babies, or a front pack or ergo for older babies in the summer months.If I'm taking the car somewhere I wrap myself up at home so I can just load the boy in at the store/park, etc.~It's comfortable for baby; mine at least.From newborn up to 5 months now (15+ lbs) he hasn't complained!~Comfortable for me; minus the sweating.Not with the Moby.My boy really likes using his arms and they're more restricted in front packs than with the Moby.~Hides baby fat.I used it right from the time my baby was home from the hospital.It only took one try to learn how to put the Moby on.I just gather the ends up in my hands before I swing it around my shoulders, so it doesn't touch the ground, for those that are concerned.Or put it on over a stroller, lean over the car seat, etc.It IS doable.However, he is just snug and comfy but not restricted.I am petite (only 4'9") and have a lot of back and neck strain as a result of carrying the baby without this.However, when he is in the Moby, his weight is right up next to me, reducing the strain or awkward position normally used when carrying a baby (hips out, back arched).I also got a Chicco carrier that I thought I would like, but the baby's weight pulls him just slightly away from my body, causing a lot of strain after wearing it just for a minute.Using the Moby has really saved me!I can now go to the store or walk around the house hands free.These are my problems with it:- extremely unwieldy.it's been 7 weeks of my using it and i'm still just starting to get used to putting it on.every time i put it on, it's different, sometimes too loose, sometimes too tight.she fights me when i have her in and it's too loose.also, when you are outside, putting it on can be a challenge without dragging the fabric on a dirty sidewalk or floor.- we overheat.i have to make sure she is wearing minimal clothing before i put her in.but after she's fallen asleep and i want to put her down for the night, i have to put clothing back on her and that poses the danger of waking her up when i'm putting a shirt or sock on her.It was a complete waste of money.I actually threw it in the trash at an airport because I was tired of it.It's impossible to manage unless you're at home putting it on.In public it just rolls on the floor while you put it on, picking up all sorts of dirt and germs.You can't wrap it on when it's just you and your little one unless you have somewhere to put the baby.When it arrived, I practiced putting it on and tried the different styles.I kept putting her in it at home to get used to it.She never did.Also, it does not fit in a diaper bag.Forget trying to get it back in the little bag it comes in!You can't wear it through airport security, so you have to wait to put it on.It makes breastfeeding more difficult  because it takes up your entire chest.(The breastfeeding hold doesn't make it easier.)It's so big and thick that it makes you hot.You'd be better off buying another sling/carrier that is smaller.I love this baby carrier!It is comfortable to wear and baby is able to fall asleep in it.I do put it on at home before I leave because it is really long and will drag on the floor.I think the Moby Wrap has a lot of potential, but possibly not for my baby.As much as she likes being held, she really doesn't like being wrapped up for more than 5 minutes on a good day.I watched videos and tried different holds to see which one would work for her and I think I'm doing everything right, but she just gets very upset either immediately or a few minutes after I put her in there.I can say though that the concept is great and during those few minutes that she lasts in the wrap, it is very comfortable and I can get some things done.I wish though she would fall asleep in it like other babies supposedly do, so we'll keep trying.If anyone had similar experiences and succeded later on, I would welcome any suggestions.The Moby Wrap has made my life soooo much easier.I was unsure of whether my baby (3 months/17 lbs) would enjoy this but he adores it, as do I!I recommend this to every mom!!I like that the Moby is versatile and that the weight is distributed evenly across my shoulders and back.I don't like how thick and heavy the cotton fabric is.It's way too hot for summer.I wish I would've gotten a lighter color and maybe that would help with the heat.I began using this wrap when our baby was 2 weeks old.She likes the hug hold and I tuck her head in one side.1 star off for thick, heavy fabric, which I guess will be a plus in the colder months.I was a little nervous ordering this because of reviews saying how difficult it was to get on...I must say it was a cinch!He was a preemie so he loves being held tight and hanging out in the sling.I've only tried one hold so far but I'm excited to try all the others.i tend to have very large babies and in a regular carrier like a snuggli or baby bjorn my back and shoulders would end up aching so much.with the moby wrap you really can distribute the weight more evenly, and if it feels a little loose, just tighten it up!with the snuggli we had for our first child i felt like he was sagging downward AND my shoulders were constantly being pulled at.the only advantage to those designs was the quick in and out for the baby, but the comfort for both of us with the moby wrap makes that convenience not worth much at all.i'm having my third boy soon and i can't wait to get out the moby wrap again!(or the moon and stars one, that's so cute!)(If you're wondering: the Ergo is my second choice, worn without the infant insert, but the bjorn and hotsling don't work for me at all.)Biggest Pro:Comfort.It feels a bit like being pregnant again and carrying my baby as a part of myself rather than carrying a heavy load cantilevered off of me.If you get a moby wrap (and I highly recommend it), find a friend who has one to show you what to do with it.Once you learn how to do it, it's not that hard, but at first it can be really confusing and not something you want to tackle when desperate with a crying newborn.If you can't find anyone to help, search youtube for instructional videos.She doesn't love any carrier.She prefers the stroller.However, when she does want to be carried, the moby frees up my arms for cooking or cleaning, and takes the strain off of my back so that I can walk where I need to go.They say you can, but I'm skeptical.It looks tough and inconvenient and I'm awkward and clumsy at breastfeeding as it is.I just stick to it as a way to make dinner when my daughter wants to be cuddled.Over the winter it has been hard to use the Moby.If I wear my son under my coat, I can't button it or put baby in his snowsuit, so he has a chilly back and sweaty front.I have a flapping coat and sweaty chest.If I wrap him over my jacket he is fine, but I get way too hot or My arms get too cold from not wearing a heavy jacket.Overall it is a great product and works great for us in very specific situations.Running around town doing errands in 35-65F weather.I think it looks cool, it is pretty comfy (I've had a back injury and it doesn't put pressure on my low back).I'm not sure why anyone would say it is hard to put on.Why I love the moby:It is light- doesn't add weight to wearing your baby.It is way easier on the back and shoulders than other carriers.My 2 month old loves it and naps like a champ in it on really fussy days.It frees one or both hands giving me some freedom to do other things while comforting her.It is very easy to use.Spit up doesn't show on the natural color!I cannot say enough good things about this baby carrier.We've tried many, many different carriers and slings, from Hotslings to Maya Wraps, from Snugglis to Baby Bjorn, and there simply isn't anything that compares to the Moby.We have tried both the Moby Wrap and the Moby D Wrap.The difference is in length and stretch of material.The regular Moby Wrap is slightly longer and has a little more "give" to it.The Moby D is a little shorter in length, and the material does not stretch as much as the regular Moby.I really like the Moby D wrap for brand newborns and younger babies because they don't slip down as much as in the Moby wrap.However, I like the extra space provided in the Moby wrap for older babies and toddlers, and for my twins.You will have to invest some time in practicing the tying of the Moby Wrap BEFORE your baby is inconsolable.It takes some effort, but it really isn't that complicated.Once you get it down, it's a breeze.Just stick with it and you'll get it.It supports your back and shoulders so well that I can't imagine why I ever used anything else.I am able to wear the babies for several hours, yes HOURS, without even a slight stitch in my back or shoulders.It almost feels like I'm wearing my babies as a t-shirt.Older babies are also very comfortable in this thing.I've hiked many steep trails in the Rocky Mountains with a 35 pound toddler wearing the Moby, and not only have I felt great, my little one actually fell asleep.We don't plan on ever using anything else.Yes, its a lot of fabric but once you get the hang of wrapping it its not that big of a deal.I like it so much I have ordered a second so I can keep one in the car and one at home.The Mobi is basically a long, narrow, stretchy length of fabric, and to put it on you must a) fold it in half down the long middle, basically forming a 15 foot long taco, then b) wrap that taco around, up, and over various parts of your body in a precise and complex way without b1) twisting it or b2) unfolding it.If it twists or comes unfolded then the entire concept fails, as your openings and support wraps don't work if they are not perfectly folded in half with no twists whatsoever.If Person A puts the Mobi on Person B, this works great, however, this assumes that neither person is holding a squawling, squiggling infant.However, if Person A wants to put the Mobi on by themselves, this requires putting the baby down somewhere else and engaging in a combination of yoga, sudoku, gymnastics, interpretive dance, and waterboarding.If the concept of this product was to put it on once in the morning and leave it on all day, this might work, but that's not the case in our household.The person using the Mobi varies multiple times a day, and for a product that is supposed to make life more convenient the logistical barrier of putting it on properly completely defeats (in my estimation) the inarguable convenience achieved once you get the stupid thing on.All that being said, my wife has asked that I share her view, which is that she loves the Mobi regardless of any logistical hassles.It distributes weight very well and has lots of different holds you can try.You will have to practice a few times (for me I used a teddy bear before my baby arrived) to become confident with using the wrap.Then you will have to try different holds to see which your little one will enjoy the best.The instruction booklet is very helpful and includes step by step pictures.I washed it in cold water and placed it in the dryer for about 10-15 mins and then let it air dry overnight.I didn't notice any shrinkage, even if it did shrink, getting it damp and stretching it back out would do the trick since it's cotton.I like this wrap because I will be able to teach Daddy how to use it!I would recommend this wrap to my friends.She cries in it, so we have not used it much.She is a newborn so we had to use the hug and hold and she is very scrunched this way and cries till we get her out of it.We will try it agian when she can have her legs sticking out at 3 months old and see.Edit: Now at 7 weeks she seems to be liking it more than before, but not for longer than a 1/2 hour if awake.It doesn't pull on your back and your hands are free.A key to using it is that it stretches so put it on snug because the baby will be better supported that way.I had to stand infront of a mirror and practice a few times.Once you get the hang of it, you'll never use another sling again.I wish I would have had this with my first 3 kids.If I wear it out on a walk with the baby, we are both sweating (i tend to be cold, but there really is a lot of fabric!).I can't use it outside the house because it drags on the floor when you are trying to put it on (which can be difficult by yourself as it is).But if you are in your clean air-conditioned house, it is useful especially for newborns.My two month old does not like it unless she is nursing to sleep, but then I always wake her up getting her out!So, useful but in limited settings.The hospitals should give these out to every new mom as they leave to go home!Only 4 mos pregnant and cannot wait to use this!The wrap came in a nice cotton bag for storage in the matching fabric color.The material is soft and light, very breathable.***Update!Baby feels so weightless in it, the wrap is so comfortable to wear I forget that I have it on!I finally got my baby to use this wrap now that she's 8 weeks old and even then for just 15 minutes.I bought it while pregnant thinking it was a great concept but now I see I should have waited to see my baby's temperament.If you're pregnant and considering this item this is my best advise to you to wait and see how your baby is and what s/he will end up liking.One thing I noticed though is that it takes a few minutes to get this on and several tries to master it so if you're running to he store quickly and want to carry your baby this won't speed up the process.As well since the fabric is so long when you wrap it around you it really doesn't look that great.I have used several different types of baby carriers including the Moby.This type of long fabric wrap is the most versatile of all baby carriers and I recommend them to people all the time.Using it takes a little more practice than other carriers but you can use it from newborn up to toddler.The Moby wrap is very stretchy so it's easier to use for beginners and works fine with very small babies but after your baby is over 10 or 12 pounds I would recommend using a different,less stretchy, wrap.The fabric is so stretchy that you have to constantly tighten it and it doesn't offer very much support for larger babies.That said, it's half the price of other wraps out there and is good for about the first three months with baby.I purchased this sling based on all of the great reviews.It may be a great sling but I am not a fan based on the amount of fabric and the time it takes just to get the sling on.There is SO much fabric it was so cumbersome to get on, not to mention to try and carry around or put on quickly away from home.I am 5'6" and weighed 230 pounds at three months postpartum when I ordered this wrap.I tried it with my baby and after all the wrapping there was barely enough material left at the end to tie.I don't have a large chest but was still sporting a postpartum belly, however, I don't think that made much of a difference.I didn't like that and the fact that there was really no give.I like the idea of this wrap and even though I wasn't happy with the material, my baby felt more secure in this wrap than any other carrier I've tried (Maya, Bjorn, Hotsling, Peanut).We purchased this tray so he could have toys and not drop them as much.It is pretty easy to get on, though with my chunky baby it is sometimes hard to get it under the seat just right when he's seated (17lbs).He does pull the tray off, but I just read a few reviews here that mentioned it has to snap.I thought I was pushing hard enough on it, but evidently maybe I'm not so I'll go back and check.Overall it has made his Bumbo a more versatile playspot, and for the price it is a good purchase.However, I find it still difficult to get the tray on with baby in the seat.It is then very stable, but kind of cumbersome to do.Other than it does what it suppose to.This tray is great for feeding and playing!I got this for my 2nd child, because I already had the bumbo from my first.For me, I was able to sit my daughter in at just a couple of weeks old, because she is so strong she could hold her head up as soon as she was born, and steadily at 2 weeks.However, I don't have this problem because my daughter didn't have the strength or dexterity to do that when she first started using the chair, and the tray.I like to use theBright Starts Lots of Linksand hook them on the edge of the tray, and hook toys to it.Even with air drying the bag, it wasn't long before this product began to leak.I've been using them for about 4 months now and they look kind of old for some reason - maybe from always repositioning them because I have a few diaper bags that vary in size.My biggest complaint with these is that for my heavier diaper bag, its hard for me to attach them to the hooks because I need both hands to hang it on (one hand to open the hook and the other to keep it from swiveling) leaving me trying to balance my diaper bag with my knee while I juggle this task.Once again, its not an issue with my lighter diaper bags but with my heavier one...its annoying.I actually ended up purchasing another set of stroller hooks just for that bag in particular - one with an open ended hook.Just expensive...Must have if you diaper bag has the special hooks on the sides.The bag stays in place.The clips stay still and made well.I use a washcloth or drape a cloth diaper over baby's legs - works much better and absorbs much more pee pee than the tee pee!My Baby loves this pacifier, I have tried him with others which he struggled with but this one fits well and does wonders when he is fussing.It was painfully obvious to me that the breast shield that came with my Medela Pump in Style was seriously too small.I ordered the XL (30 mm) because it was the largest one I found easily.It fit better but still wasn't quite big enough.It feels so much better.Plus, I actually get more milk at each session because my nipples aren't being shoved into a too small shield which can restrict milk flow by putting pressure on your milk ducts.The one that came with my pump seemed way to small, so I got the biggest size based on reviews.Using this size seems to drasticly reduce the amount of suction I get with my manual hand pump.Too bad you can't just buy one to try it!It's wide enough and sturdy enough for a hot cup of coffee and can even serve as a cell phone holder, but the price?The price was outrageous for the product.There are several alternatives out there, including some lesser-known brands at BRU, and had I known about those before, I would have bought one of those instead for half of the price.However, shipping was quick and the product arrived neatly packaged in it's original box with all of the parts.Putting the cup holder on was also a breeze and removing it can be a bit difficult.I'm still trying to figure out the best way to use this thing because it's awkward on my Graco Cleo.It covers the stroller and stayed on in the wind, but it just doesn't look right.For some reason it looks like it's tilting on one side regardless of where I position the ties.I also can't get it to cover my baby's feet - only a problem if your baby is barefoot a lot.Maybe the regular protect a bug is better.I originally bought the navy one to match our green stoller, however the handles and everything else are black (duh!)and I prefer things to match.It is super easy to attach and folds up easily and fits in a small bag.This product is easy to use, easy to store, and does a great job of keeping my baby out of the sun.I love how big it is and shades the baby from the side and from the top.This product is fantastic.The existing shade on the Cortina is thick and nice but almost worthless because it's too small.This product is simply necessary and it works just as I'd hoped.The angles to block sun so it does a good job even when walking towards the sun.When my baby is in shorts on really hot days, I have to either cover his legs or put a lot of sunblock on because they do get some sun, but most of him is in the shade.It's your standard particle board used with most "lesser" expensive furniture, although this was still almost $200, but that is just what you get these days.As usual, these type of things come in a lot of parts.Once it was all together, I liked the way it looked.I really like this stroller, but I feel like for [...] there's some features that really need improvement.Its got some great features - absolutely love the reverse handle.Couldn't be easier to switch her direction if the sun is too much on her.Weight is good.I've lifted it one handed out of my trunk.Opens one handed easily.Fits just fine in my car trunk (I have a nissan) and folded away in my hall closet.My baby seems to really enjoy the ride in it.Folding it up is very involved.Its a two hand fold.But you also have to first lower the seat, switch the hand back, adjust the wheels and THEN you can use to hands to collapse it.Steering is frustrating at times.I don't think it navitages well when turning around or making close turns.When the handle is in the reverse position, a slight incline or strong wind can make it start steering sideways.You have to kick the wheels back straight.I emailed the company to see if my wheelers are defective or this is a problem with the stroller in this position.Waiting to hear.PROS:~ easily reversible so child can look out or at youCONS:~ Not easy to fold or open: when folding it scrapes on the ground wearing on theplastic, the plastic latch is difficult to manuver while opening it, the plasticlatch doesn't catch easily when folding it, need 2 hands to open and fold, bulkywhen folded...~ Car seat adapter bar isn't very sturdy, car seat (Britax Chaperone) just barelyfits width wise~ Not a very sturdy stroller.When pushing down to go over bumps/curbs the wholestroller flexes.~ Wheels get "stuck" easily on bumps, curbs, etc~ Material is "slippery".I have to frequently reposition my daughter because she slides down while in it.Compact with head cushion.Easy to clean.My only suggestion is to check the store first.I could have got this for less and wouldn't have to wait for it to be shipped to my house.I use this every day.It is much easier than carrying around a diaper bag now that my baby is a little bit older (10 months) and I don't need to carry as much stuff around all the time.I carry my debit cards, lip stick, gum, etc., in the outside zippered pocket.I couldn't find a store that carried both, so I picked up one of each.Here are my comparisons on certain features.Folded Size: Winner - tieThe Deluxe Fold & Go, when folded, is the same width, but about 2" shorter in length than the Munchkin Kit.However, because of this, it is also bulkier when folded.However, the Fold & Go Kit's pad is lightly padded throughout, while the Munchkin Kit only has padding for the baby's head; no padding anywhere else.The allows for more room to hold a small tube of cream or Vaseline.This makes the Fold & Go Kit's pockets less structural, which is really not an issue with something stiff like a wipes case, but is a pain with soft squishy things like diapers.Contents are very secure in the Munchkin Kit.This isn't a problem while the kit is closed, but when opening the kit, the wipes case very easily (and does) fall out of its mesh pocket.The Fold & Go Kit's openings are not elastic - which is ok since they aren't stiff at all, but is a really nice touch on the Munchkin Kit.Velcro closure: Winner - Deluxe Fold & Go KitThe Deluxe Fold & Go Kit wins this round because it has more Velcro.This allows you to stuff more into it, and keeps the overall kit closed better.But as a result, it isn't as attractive as the Munchkin Kit.One downer about it, though is that the interior is not moisture resistant; you can see the lining.I wouldn't put leaky pens in this pocket.Stroller strap/carrying strap: Winner - Munchkin Travel KitThe Munchkin Kit's stroller strap is longer and has more Velcro so the length can be varied.The Deluxe Fold & Go Kit's stroller strap has only a small patch of Velcro, so its length is fixed.The kit also has decorative accents sewn in.The Fold & Go Kit feels like alot of vinyl, very plasticky.Ok for inside a diaper bag, which is our intended use, but not very pretty to carry in public by itself.And if you're using this inside a diaper bag like I am, a lot of the features that make the Munchkin Kit more desirable aren't even necessary.Overall, we are keeping both of these bags, though we have no intention of using them as a diaper kit on their own.They will be used as changing pads with a little extra.They have no room for other things like pacifiers, change of clothes, or a cell phone.These aren't hands free, either, so I recommend only using these if you have a stroller to put these in, or they will be a pain to carry around.If you need something this small, you might want to look into a smaller diaper bag instead.UPDATE 8/22/11: The Munchkin case keeps its shape even when the wipes case is removed, while the Fold N Go turns into a big burrito.When we hike, we will use the Munchkin case because its slim form factor fits better in our hiking carrier, the Deuter Kid Comfort III.Great carrier, by the way....So far, this thermos has worked great.I use it for my daugher's lunch at daycare.Whenever I went out I would pack the milk in the munchkin cooler and throw this in the diaper bag.I'd put 1 cup of water in the microwave for 2 minutes and then pour boiling hot water in the thermos.Toss in the diaper bag and I was good to go.It does not leak and it stays hot for hours as it claims.It was a lifesaver.I don't know what the point of this jar is and now I feel like I wasted my money.It says on the label that it keeps food hot for 5 hours but in the fine print it says not to use it with food that spoils.What foods don't spoil?Chicken soup obviously can't go in it.I don't even know what I can send my son to school with in this thermos.Update: Test this out for yourself before you trust your kids to say their food is still hot at lunchtime.They could end up in hospital with food poisoning!I tested it.Then three hours later I checked the temperature of the food.It was in the danger zone- 120 degrees.Since I don't feel like making my kids sick, this is one of those purchases that will sit around my house never used :(She calls it her coffee cup.in the beginning it worked well.now, several months later, I can no longer get the yellow sippy part to insert properly into the lid so that it will screw on properly.when I do get the thing together  (and, there are four parts:  1. the cup, 2. the lid with handles, 3. the yellow soft part that inserts into the lid, and 4. the little white thing that snaps onto the underside of the yellow part of the lid that keeps water from leaking out unless sucked out).as I was saying, when I do get it together now, it leaks.it's really hard to get the yellow sippy part to snap exactly into the blue part so it doesn't leak.it's a great product & has good grips for the kids.there's nothing defective with mine....it's just that when you disassemble the whole thing in to four parts in order to run it thru the dishwasher, it is near impossible to get it back together so it won't leak.(specifically, it's hard to get the yellow bendable thing back into the lid the right way.That is a major plus for me.Now that I have many, many stains all over my wool rug, I have now changed my mind.- There are many pieces to take apart for cleaning and it is not easy to do so.If you don't line the soft spout up with the hard top exactly right when you are putting it back together, it will leak a LOT.It seemed to be leaking from underneath the sealed yellow band that is part of the handle assembly.- We've gone through four soft spouts for this sippy.My 2 year old chews through the spouts easily.Now for the UNSAFE part that caused us to throw in the towel on these sippys:- We just discovered that under the little yellow rim inside the cup at the very top is a great hiding place for gunk, bacteria, and buildup.It has been cleaned many times by hand and in the dishwasher, and we were horrified that our son has been drinking out of this grossly contaminated cup for so long.Now that I look at the cup with a more discriminating eye, I can't imagine that you could really get it absolutely clean, given the design.It fits all the "essentials" for quick trips.Great product - so useful!May be it is obvious to some, but it was not for me.The sheet is 100% polyester.Surprisingly, the product description does not even mention it anywhere, and it's not mentioned on the packaging.I had to take the sheet out, search for the label, and only then saw that it is made out of the material I do not want my daughter to sleep on.These sheets are so super soft.Plus, there is no shrinkage, or pilling.These sheets are so soft!I looked for sheets everywhere and could not find any like these.I would recommend these to everyone!!They also make the basineet sheets!Baby loves the soft sheets!Super soft sheet for my newborn to lay on.Just got this, so it's only been washed/dried one time...but it's incredibly soft.I'm using it for my moses basket, but there's plenty of room for a slightly larger mattress -- because the elastic is gathered all the way around the sheet, it stays fairly snug on the smaller moses basket "mattress" as well.I want one of these in queen size for myself!I absolutely love this sheet!I highly recommend this product!I don't find them "fluffy" so I'm not concerned about SIDS when I use them.I have the same changing table covers and love those as well.Although, he's not sleeping in his crib yet.I would absolutely recommend this and I would definitely buy it again.This sheet is so soft and comfortable.If you've used a porta crib, you know how hard and cardboard-like the "matress" is.It's so soft and good quality.Much better than the hard, scratchy terrycloth covers I had at first.I would highly recommend this product.I had a difficult time finding a cover to fit a flat changing pad because all of them seem to only fit contoured pads.I like the structure and softness of this cover, and although baby isn't here yet to use it, I think it will hold up well in the wash.I bought this sheet because I run a home daycare and needed something inexpensive for the pack and plays where the children sleep.I was impressed with how soft this was!I have washed it several times already and it is holding up well.Its not as soft as the Baby Bjorn sheet but I dont think the Baby Bjorn sheet is $30 better.This fitted sheet is soft (if a bit lightweight) and fits snugly & securely around our crib mattress.You have to really pull the sheet to get it around the mattress, but it does work... We've been using it for five months now without any problems.All in all, a good buy and a good fit!FYI, we are using the MDB Crescent Mini Crib Mattress -- for the MDB Kalani mini crib -- and the American Baby Co. waterproof fitted quilted Porta-Crib Mattress Pad.I also appreciate the price of this fitted sheet.It's affordable enough that you can buy several... and it is a good idea to have extras handy because baby spit-up happens often!This is a great sheet for the price.The Graco PnP mattresses fold accordion style and when you stretch this and the mattress cover over the mattress, it's going to fold up (hello...tight elastic stretched over something that bends...common sense!), but when you stretch it out in your PnP (where it should fit snugly) it will not make the mattress fold up.The sheet fits my portable crib, and it's a cute print, BUT - it's not soft at all!After every wash it's just as stiff as it was.I purchased these when I was first being introduced to the cloth diapering world.Overall, I'd say if you're looking for something to minimize contact with messes, opt for a disposable liner (Amazon sells a great biodegradable, disposable liner).Just because I have them, I use them if we're leaving the house for a tad bit more absorbency in the prefolds.They certainly don't act as doublers, they only avoid having to clean small messes...not really beneficial for big blowouts.I love these little liners, and for the price, you can't beat these.They are 100% cotton, so no microfiber stink, and the benefit of all natural fibers.They are thin, which is what you want in a liner.Many people have complained that they aren't very think, (perhaps they are looking for a hefty doubler) but I think the fact that they are thin is an asset.If you really want a thicker doubler, you can stack two on top of each other, but having them thin means you can customize the absorbency.They are perfect for putting inside an All in One diaper, or on top of a tri-folded pre-fold, and make flushing the poo off much easier - you just lift out the liner and it's much easier to clean.I put them inside all my diapers- it helps keep the AIO's free from stain, adds a little more absorbency, but not a lot of bulk.Some complained that they were short or small, but I think that this too is also an asset  It keeps the extra absorbency of the diaper where you need it, between the legs and in front,  and doesn't add extra bulk through the whole diaper, where you don't.I plan to buy more.I guess I didn't check into these carefully enough.They are not liners but extra liners for Kushies AIO.all of mine have shrunk after their first washing and seem extremely worn out for just a few washings each (they've only been washed maybe 10 or 20 times each so far - and I've never used bleach on them), but they do a good job for overnight cloth diapering or for saving the diaper itself from too much soil (poop) stains.My favorite thing about this product is the size.It really seems like it was designed with mothers in mind because of the convenient extra pockets and manageable size.I read some reviews about the strap breaking, which has not happened to me of course because I just barely got it, but I pulled on the end of the strap that they were talking about to see and I can see how it could be a problem because the threading there is visible and doesn't appear to be incredibly sturdy.However, I don't think that mine will break because it seems sturdy enough to handle what I need it for.I imagine that some of these bags are worse than others in this area.There are only two things I could complain about (other than the potentially weak strap).Still, I did not plan to wear it messenger style anyway (just think it would be nice to have the option) and the gender neutrality thing is not all that big of a deal to me.Overall, I really like this bag.(I noticed this product was lacking in good images))I saw these at Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10 just before Christmas and ended up going back a few days later and getting them.He chews on the legs and the head.He throws them.He lines them up along the table and then flings them all off.So while they aren't played with as intended, he still likes them.They have held up really well and seem pretty durable for a toy (I actually drove over one of them and it popped back to normal like nothing ever happened.)I couldn't stand the feel of them on my fingers much less putting these next to my baby's skin.I like the idea of a one size diaper - but not the idea of nothing but man made fabric.Wouldn't recommend them for anyone.new to cloth diapering- trying to figure out if its right for you?- check out this link to help break down the lingo and facts: [...].if that link doesnt work- i will copy and paste the info at the bottom of this review.And now- MY two cents....I used disposable first as my baby was too small to fit into his ALL-IN-ONE BumGenius pocket diapers.He grew into them once he reached 10 lbs.(around 1 month old).Originally I only had 20 diapers but quickly purchased another 20.The total of 40 diapers ran around $650.00.If you do the math, thats what you will pay for dispoables in the first 5 - 6 months!VERY few leaks.Actally had more leaks and blowouts with the disposable diapers- also more issues with diaper rash.They go on with ease- the velcro makes them just like disposable diapers.Once I have removed the used diaper I simply place it in my Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag.I initially feared there would be smells through my house from this type of diapering.There is NO SMELL.To wash, I use a special detergent on them: Charlie's Soap Powder or Rockin Green Cloth Diaper and Laundry Detergent.Once you are getting solid bowel movements- you can use liners and shke solids off into a toilet.Warning- even if liner says "flushable" DO NOT FLUSH- its not worth the plumming bill!These diapers make cloth diapering as easy as disposable with the obvious $$$ benefit.I dont know why people are still using disposable diapers.REALLY, what a waste of money!HERES THE INFO FROM THAT LINK IN THE BEGINNING OF MY REVIEW:Curious About Cloth?Get the Skinny on Today's Cloth DiapersToday's parents make hundreds of decisions for their little ones with a combination of instinct, friends' advice, and research.Even with the recent surge in sales of new types of cloth diapers, many parents remain unaware of the latest developments in cloth.Curious moms are going to the Internet to research, but basic information is still somewhat hard to find.There have always been economic and environmental advantages to using cloth diapers.Clearly, having diapers that can be washed and used again saves (a lot of) money and keeps disposable diapers from filling up landfills.Even the most expensive and fancy cloth diapering system will save the average family $1,000 or more over disposables.Unfortunately, many moms today still envision cloth diapering as squares of cotton, safety pins (eek!)and plastic pants.CuteyBaby wants to help!Some Wraps put the PUL between layers of cotton for a very soft feel.The Wrap usually closes with Velcro or snaps so you can adjust fit.Absorbent layers - which could be cotton, hemp, bamboo, or microfiber - are placed inside the wrap to hold liquid.Some moms attach the absorbent layers with a Snappi closure.A "prefold" just refers to the old kind of diaper with thickness down the center.Hemp Babies FlatsSeveral manufacturers make squares ("Prefolds" or "Flats") that you fold in thirds to use inside a Wrap.Prefolds and Flats can be a variety of materials.At changing time, some moms will just switch the absorbent layers and re-use the Wrap/Cover if the baby is only a little wet.Pros: Cheap - the least expensive of cloth diaper styles.Flexible - Moms can adjust absorbency by adding more layers.Cons: Putting them together requires extra time, effort.Examples: Wraps: Bummis, Thirsties, Imse VimsePrefolds/Flats: Swaddlebees, Bummis, Green Acre Designs, Hemp BabiesThe "Wrap with Fitted" diaper:Kissaluvs Fitted Cloth DiaperThis diapering method is similar to the "Wrap with Prefolds" approach except it has a fitted absorbent layer.It is the most common design because it can be loaded up with absorbent layers that stay relatively in place.Pocket diapers are often "one-size" designs that can be adjusted to fit babies of different sizes.Pros: Selection - Many options with snaps, Velcro, different soakers.Absorbency can be adjusted by stuffing in extra soakers.Cons: Requires disassembly before and re-stuffing after washing.One-size designs can be bulky at the small settings and may not fit up to potty training age.Examples: Happy Heiny, Fuzzi Bunz, Bum Genius, Smartipants, Blueberry, Rocky MountainThe "All-In-One/All-In-Two" diaper (AIO or AI2):CuteyBaby All-in-One Cloth DiaperThese diapers are usually all one piece but sometimes have a snap in soaker, making it an "all-in-two".The easiest type to use, they require little or no assembly and, like all cloth diapers, can be washed in a regular home washing machine.Some AIO/AI2 diapers come in sizes, and other are adjustable "one-size" designs.Pros: Simple - Very easy to use, no stuffing/assembly needed.Cons: Often require longer drying times, may not have enough built-in absorbency.Examples: Dream-Eze, GroBaby, CuteyBabyDiaper DialogueGetting started with cloth diapers can be confusing!Different manufacturers may call something by different names.To help you sort things out, here are a few of the most common terms:Soaker: The soaker is the highly absorbent portion of the diaper.Also see: DoublerDoubler: A doubler looks like a pad and is an absorbent soaker that can be added to a cloth diaper if you are having leakage problems or for times when extra protection may be needed such as overnight.Liners are disposable or flushable and usually come on a roll.Liquids flow through to the diaper as usual, but liners keep the poop from staining or sticking - you can flush or throw them away at each diaper change.Snappi: A special "T" or "Y" shaped plastic closure to secure fitteds or contours (like a fitted with no elastic or closure) on the baby (replaces diaper pins).Sized diapers will give the best fit, but you will need to buy more as your baby grows.Check out our Cloth Diaper Comparison chart to see how a size "medium" fitted diaper compares to "one-size" diapers in a few of the top diaper lines.Wet Bag: Many moms like to have these washable, waterproof fabric zipper bags for dirty diapers.You can also just stash some plastic grocery bags in your diaper bag to bring home dirties.100% Polyester interlock is laminated (could be 1-2 mil thickness) on one side and becomes waterproof but remains breathable.Good quality PUL can withstand very high temperatures and should last for 100s of washings.This is usually 100% polyester or sometimes recycled plastic fiber content.They do stain more easily than other lining fabrics.Cotton: Our old friend cotton still plays a big role in diapering.Organic cotton is a popular soaker/inside material and is used for fitted and contour diapers (that require a cover).Cotton is very slow to dry and may require up to 8 washes before it reaches full absorbency.However, organic and "regular" cotton perform the same in diapering.Hemp (fleece, terry): Hemp is stronger, more absorbent, and more durable than cotton and most other fabrics.Hemp requires several hot washes to reach full absorbency (called prepping), and it will shrink A LOT - usually in one direction.Hemp absorbs like crazy and many moms swear by hemp Doublers/Boosters (see above) for night time cloth diapering.Bamboo (fleece, velour): Bamboo has a silky texture and is very absorbent.Bamboo fleece and velour are used in fitted diapers and as interior diaper fabrics.Bamboo and hemp are still quite expensive fabrics, and that will show in the price of diapers that use them.Wool: Many experienced cloth diapering moms swear by wool outer layers.Wool requires some special care to keep its water resistance, and I wouldn't recommend it for a mom who is trying out cloth diapering for the first time.If you are new to cloth diapering, I recommend getting some disposable/flushable liners with your first purchase.If you line the diapers, then you just lift off the little liner thing and trash or flush it.If no liner, then you sort of shake poops out into the toilet.Some moms like to have their dirty diaper bin in the bathroom.So at changing time they take off the dirty dipe, set it aside, put on fresh diaper - then walk into the bathroom & shake out / flush, leaving the dirties in a container or laundry bag in the bathroom.Other moms (myself included) have two bins by the changing table - one for trash (shake out or put liner in there) and one for the diaper laundry.If you want to try cloth diapering, pick the type of diaper that suits you best and buy enough for one day's use (usually 6-10 diapers or 4-6 wraps plus prefold/fitted).Maybe pick two brands and buy a few of each so you can see what you like best.Once you see that it's "no big deal" you can expand your collection - or "stash" of diapers, as we say.If you don't like it, there are several sites where people buy pre-owned diapers in good condition.The people there can be extremely helpful and will answer any questions you have about the different types of cloth diapers.These are comfortable, soft, and convenient.I've had two of these for several months now.My only problem with the pocket diapers is that you have to wash the entire thing, whereas with prefolds and fitteds you only have to wash the diaper and not the cover (unless they poo).I thought I'd chicken out with cloth diapers, but these make it so easy!I still do regular ones when we go out or at night, but I use about 1-2 a day only.I also have the Thirsties covers and use baby kicks prefold diapers, but the Bumgenius are really much easier and fit better.They are great for my heavy night wetter.The only thing I don't like about them is stuffing them once they are clean!My husband even says they work better than the disposables we used initially.We have not had one 'blowout' or leak and we had almost daily occurances with disposables.As far as extra work- 2 diaper loads a week- big deal.I would recommend these to anyone!UPDATE:  I have been using these for 16 months now and still would recommend to anyone.They do need to have inserts in them for naps and bedtime, but still do the job.They have held up with washing and airdrying with no problems so far.Just like disposables with the velcro tab.Baby has had no diaper rash whatsoever in 2 months!I gave these diapers 4 out of 5 stars because I have been happy with them for a year.They were a bit pricey when compared to prefolds and covers, and even some other pocket diapers, but I heard good things, so I was willing to spend the money.After a year, I am shopping for more diapers.He was a VERY heavy overnight wetter and with the toddler inset and doubler, we didn't have any leaking issues as long as we changed him as soon as he got out of bed.I just put the insert back in, lined it up, folded it in half, and my husband or sitter could take them right off the diaper stacker just like a disposable.They don't have to mess with anything like most prefold / cover diapers.What I don't like:Very detailed washing instructions:  I am glad I had to wash these (particularly the inserts) a few times before we were able to use them because I felt like I was doing something wrong or forgetting a step every time.I ended up taping the instructions from the BumGenius website above the washer.Maybe I was paranoid, but the money I spent, I didn't want to destroy them by using the wrong detergent or wash cycle!Quick to Wear: When I did the math, what I spent on these diapers (24 of them) was what I would have spent on 2 years of disposables.For me, that was more than acceptable because while it seemed really expensive up front, it meant we would be saving money in the long run unless our daughter potty trained VERY early.Now, a little less than a year afetr using them, they are wearing a lot.The velcro isn't as catchy as it used to be.I have had 2 diapers where the top back seam has come completely undone, which makes the diaper unusable because that's the seam that secures the back elastic.My daughter isn't terribly big, nor are we particularly rough with the diapers, so it seems a bit ridiculous for this sort of wear and tear, even with daily use.I have joined a Cloth Diaper swap to try to get some feel for other types before we make another big investment, and it seems I am the lucky one in the circle - most of the other moms who use the BG's have had the same problem in less time.If you've got the money to spend, these diapers are very good.They contain blowouts very well, are absorbent, easy and convenient for other care providers, and aren't terrible to look at.If you're trying to cloth diaper on a budget, or don't want to have to expand your stash in a year, I would check out Thirsties Duo Wraps, gDiapers, or another prefold / cover combination.We've added 2 gDiaper covers and 2 Thirsties Duo Wraps to our rotation in the hopes of holding on to the BG's until she potty trains, but at this rate, I think we will probably be buying more Thirsties and gDiapers!After reading reviews, these were one of the first cloth diapers I decided to give a trial run.I also liked that they came with the insert that you can snap to double it up on one end.They line dry great.I have washed them every night since buying them and there is no noticable wear thus far.On the negative side, I have a rather chunky 9 month old (24 lbs and carries most of his weight in the thigh area), and this diaper barely fits him.It is a little short through the rise, so when I stretch it for a better fit, it is pretty tight on his legs.This would not be a problem in a child with thinner legs, however, so I just want those with bigger babies to be aware.My daughter is now 11 months and we've been using these diapers since she was two months old.She was a small baby when she was born (5 lbs 2 ounces) and they were a little too big, so we couldn't use them right away.I really like these diapers, however.I also really like the fact that they grow with your child (the three snaps on the front allow you to change the size) and that they are environmentally friendly.These diapers have never leaked, except for once when I didn't put the insert in properly.putting the inserts in), but now I just shove them all in a drawer and assemble as I change my daughter - its much less tedious.It just takes a second to put the insert it, so no biggy.When my daughter went to daycare, we took a whole bunch of regular disposable diapers for them to use.She suddenly started getting diaper rash - we realized it was all the chemicals etc that regular diapers use.She never gets diaper rash when we use cloth diapers, so now we only use cloth or "green" disposables.Do one wash on cold and the second wash on hot.I also like letting them dry in the sun which bleaches them naturally.Even though you use water to wash the diapers, cloth diapers are still the most environmentally friendly option as "green" disposables do not biodegrade, and we love these.I've seen other cloth diapers in stores, but none compare to the quality of Bum Genius.When people find out we are using cloth diapers, they are shocked and ask "Why bother?Isn't it a hassle?", but when I show them how our BG's work (and how cute they are), they are always impressed and want to get some for themselves or someone they know.Yup, this diaper fits my newborn and my 15 month old!And the diaper itself dries fast.Though i thought that it is a little big and sometimes gets in the way of my baby when he is trying to feed himself cheerios.Overall, great product, am pleasedIt wasn't hard at all for my husband to install from wall to banister at an angle.I give it 4 out of 5 stars at this time b/c the pieces that screw into the wall are made of plastic, not metal.So far it's worked great and seems durable but it's only been 4 months.I used it from birth till now (8.5 month) and the battery still alive.It might seem expensive, but it's worth it for sure.I love the prints of these sheets.They are so cute.I would have chosen a different fabric though as these are fairly thin and the material is not as soft as I was hoping.Overall it is a decent product, just wish it was softer.I love this sheet.It is a great product for the price.The sheet was soft and comfortable.Fits my baby's mattress well.I am buying more in different prints.Have not washed it yet and hope that is stays as soft as the previous reviewer had noted.The sheet fits well and is soft.The pattern is cute and well like by my girls.I am not dissatisfied because I just wanted some reasonably priced cotton sheets for back up.We will see how they hold up after being washed.This brings me to remembering the first few baths given to my daughter once we were home from the hospital.I had purchased one of those long bath tubs that's a massive space hog because I didn't know any different and that's what was available to me in the stores I shopped at.My daughter would end up crying for her entire bath and be completely freezing no matter how quickly and much I tried to keep warm water on her.Also when she got a little bigger but not quite able to sit up on her own yet, she would end up getting bruises on her back from lift that was in the tub I purchased.Before I received this tub, I was skeptical if she would even fit but low and behold she does and absolutely loves her bath times even more!I like that I can sit over the side of the bathtub and easily wash my child without bending over uncomfortably or kneeling on the floor, very helpful to a very pregnant mommy with an already achy back I might add.Though if wanting to wash your baby elsewhere, you could easily purchase the stool accessory also available on the Tummy Tub website which also doubles as a toddler step stool.I've been using the Tummy Tub for about a week now and have had no issues with it whatsoever.Will I use this with my newborn?You can bet that I will though I will be careful because bathing a newborn baby in a sitting position can be a little tricky with them not being able to support their own head quite yet.As a first-time mom, I had a bit of a learning curve trying to get the water level right and trying to get the holding the baby with one hand and washing with the other hand thing down.Once my son got past the uncertainty during his first couple baths, this tub became his favorite place to be.When he would start to get fussy, I could put him in his tub, and he perked right up.The tub makers say that it promotes baby starting to stand early, and I found that to be the case.What makes it better is that you can set it on the floor, on the table, or just about anywhere.There's no bending so it isn't hard on your back.To make the Tummy Tub even more convenient, add the stool and make it the perfect height to clean the baby while seated in a chair.At first I thought this was the most ridiculous thing I ever saw....an over-priced bucket!I recommend going to their website and viewing the slide show of 500+ pictures.She's been in that tub since 1wk old and sometimes even falls asleep in the bath!For us, this bar was both pricey and unnecessary.Although the bar works great for our carseat (Graco 32 Snugride), we only used it for a very short time and therefore wasn't worth the money.As an avid runner, I still had to take about 6 weeks off from running after delivery.So, I was walking in those 6 weeks and I used this carseat adapter.Additionally, running with the carseat definitely adds weight and wind resistance so you will probably be inclined to stop using it as soon as possible.If you are looking to save money, skip this product and perhaps spend your $$ on the BOB weather shield or the BOB handlebar console.Okay, so we love love love Bob products!High quality, durable!We have a combi car seat (it's not on the compatible list).You do not need the padding below and remove one of the bars (like you would for the Graco car seat).Works with Gracco Car Seats.Dooooo it.I give them 4 stars because I think that they are a bit pricey; it would be great if you could purchase them in a set of two.They were the only thing that I could find to work to save my banisters from drilling and holes and they worked perfectly for that purpose -  so maybe they are a bargain:-)If you're looking for a light weight stroller for 2 kids (toddler and a younger child) and do not want to spend in the $300's and $400's, this is the one to buy.I can fit 2 drinks, my wallet and 2 cell phones comfortably in it.It also has an oversized umbrella that can cover both child.You can move it and adjust it to block out the sun pretty well.Cons: The basket on the bottom is smaller than my ideal.It's also harder to access because the seats cover up most of the open space where you can stick your hands in.Currently, we've been putting a baby car seat in the front so we are able to stick a diaper bag on the front seat under the car seat and it works better for access.The pull-out seat (where the older child sits) is able to pull out further (if child wants to sit) and slides back in when the child stands, but when they're sitting, it slides back a lot and I end up having to pull it out further for my son.It's a little annoying.It never flipped on me, but I had it off 2 wheels at one point.It's hard to put him in the pull out seat because you have to watch out for the handle bar.He's able to pull out some of our drinks from it.My kids are 2 1/2 years apart, and I was seriously hoping I'd never have to buy a double stroller.It was a good setup.When my daughter turned a year, she suddenly discovered strollers.Doing day trips was getting a little harder, and I started wishing I could have a better place to store my diaper bag, not to mention a place where both kids could sit.I remembered looking at Joovy strollers when I was pregnant, but I never got one.I decided to start looking at them again-- we were planning a trip that summer and I knew that it would be nice to have a new stroller before that trip.After much research (especially after viewing Baby Gizmo's video review), I decided to get the Joovy Caboose Ultralight.I don't think I've ever been happier with a stroller, and this is my fourth one.Easy to maneuver-- Of course, it's harder than my Maclaren, especially when it's fully loaded with kids, but it's so much easier than other double strollers.If I really need to, I can sort of push it one handed for a short time, especially if only one kid is riding.Since my kids are both totally mobile, they don't ride in the stroller the whole time, but it's not really cumbersome to push the empty stroller.It's also not very big-- I think it's just slightly bigger than a regular single stroller.I can fit it through doorways and it doesn't take up a lot of room when parked.Storage-- Keep in mind, every time I'd put a diaper bag on the back of the Maclaren, it would tip over if no kid was inside, so it's SO NICE having a storage basket.It can fit a pretty full diaper bag.I can also put things in the outside pockets, so I usually stash snacks and water there.If you do recline it fully, the older child can only stand in the back.The sunshade is nice and big and can cover both kids sufficiently.), I usually don't buckle him in.My daughter also enjoys her snack tray, though her Nuby sippy cups don't fit in the beverage slots on the tray.Collapsing the stroller-- My only big complaint about this stroller is that the locking mechanism for when the stroller is collapsed doesn't hold very well.It comes undone when I put the stroller in the car or I take it out, so the stroller sometimes threatens to open when I'm not ready for it to open.But it does collapse easily, and you can open the stroller with hardly any effort.I almost look forward to taking a stroller with me when I'm out and about with the kids.Honestly I had wasted much money on other pacifiers because now at 2 months old these are all she'll take.She has the frog and the giraffe which are both so cute and functional.She is able to hold on to the hands of the animal (esp.I was always digging around in his car seat searching for his pacifier when he spit it out so I needed a solution.It makes it so easy to find wherever he drops it or spits it out.It is very light weight so it is not too heavy even for a newborn.The only downside is that if you need to rinse it off, you have to be careful not to get the animal wet but if you do, it dries quickly (as long as you don't soak it).I would recommend the Wubbanub especially for babies that like the Soothie pacifiers.After they outgrow the pacifier, I remove it from the stuffed animal and they still have their lovey.My 6 year old still plays w/ his little green frog, (without the pacifier attached), and sleeps w/ him each night.We've had several varieties and the green frog is the best as far as weight, lying on the baby just right and easy for baby to hold.This pacifer is so cute.The pacifer is attached to the horse, so you can't really lose it.Also you can't replace the pacifer in the horse's mouth.Plus, the baby can play with the horse while using the pacifer.I understand the idea behind this but think there are better products out there.I dont recommend.We give 4 stars!The Good:* It is seriously soooooo cute!Not to heavy and not to light.It will nicely stay right on babies belly without falling off unless baby wants to play with the horse itself.* Looks to be well made.Since you have no option but to have the Soothie sewn in it is the best option in size I guess.Not too big and not too small.The Bad:* I hate that the Soothie paci is sewn in.Couldn't there have been some other way to do this... now instead of buying one Wubbanub and a few Soothie's to replace a dirty one with you have to buy several Wubbanub's?That can get expensive.Had I done my research and learned that the paci is actually sewn in I would have bought the Soothie Pacifier Attacher.FYI - Our Wubbanub did not smell when we got it out of the box and honestly I would not have held that against them if it had... come on... manufacturing plants don't smell good.Would you rather they spray toys down with perfume before sending????I have tried 4 other brands so I was skeptical when I came across this one.But it is super!It is easy to use and it keeps those doors shut from any toddler!They installed in 1 minute and are a breeze to operate, just side them over using the handle.Make sure you purchase one for each door.I highly recommend these for moms with curious little ones.Our doors must not be standard depth.The other door locks (w/twist button) work just as well in my opinion (we now have both kinds).Both still allow for some "give" and similarly seem a bit flimsy ... with enough force i think either kind would break easily, but not something I suspect my 1 yr old will be able to do.We have these on metal bi-fold doors.We did have to lower the doors a little (by adjusting the screws) but this wasn't really a big deal.The rod that hangs down to move the door lock from side to side is fairly useless because, even on a door where this slides easily, the rod just bends when used.I've also had a problem with it getting stuck a few times when I forgot to move it aside before opening the door.Aside from the problems I've had though it does keep the door shut and is well out of reach of my son so I would still recommend this product.I'd been worried for a while about how to keep our toddler out of the folding closet doors in her room.Never would I have thought a small piece of plastic would work so well, but it does!Great product!Consider a different chair..cons: Assembly took me an hour because the pre-drilled holes did not line up and connector fell out.I ended up drilling my own holes for some of them instead.Chair is a reddish cherry - looked more espresso colored in the pic online.i bought this chair thinking my baby would sit on it but i was soooo  wrong he doesen't like it at all maybe if it was cushioned or something ....anyways we don't use it it was easy for him to get out of the straps.When dining out my son seemed to love this high chair so I ordered it.Assembled it in no time.I forgot to put the strap around the bar infront of the child seat so I had to loosen the screw but it was no problem.Instruction wasn't clear on that part but it wasn't too hard to figure out.My son love sitting on here.I have a Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat - Red/White that i purchased prior to this.And the table for it fits perfectly with this high chair so I got 2 long velcro strap from local hardware store and strapped it on for a high chair with a table.Like almost anything I purchase I did a lot of research before I decided to try this pump.I was very skeptical about purchasing a manual pump because a lot of lactation consultants refer to them as torture devices.I had used two different electric pumps with my son 3 years ago and wanted to make sure I got something that was going to work so I could continue to provide our daughter with breast milk.At first I was looking into the lansinoh electric pump but after reading all the rave reviews on this pump I decided to try it.I am soo glad I bought this pump.It works soo much better then the other pumps I have used.I know one reviewer found it "frustrating" cause she stated it wouldnt work with droplets of water in it....However I have had to use this pump while it was still wet cause I was at work and fully engorged and the pump worked just the same wet.I have had no issues with this pump and thanks to this pump I have been able to exclusively breast feed my daughter for 3 months now.I had a small cooler from one of the electric pumps I had and I am able to fit the pump, 2 bottles and a cool pack in it when I go to work.It has been a huge life saver and you cant beat the price!I love lansinoh products and will continue to use them and recommend them.This manual pump is good.Only complaint is that for some reason it developed an annoying squeak.I really like Lansinoh products, so when my daughter decided at 8 months she was going to have none of nursing for about a week, I knew I needed some sort of pump and turned to Lansinoh.Now keep in mind this is not an electric pump, so it definitely takes longer.And let-down can be difficult with a manual pump.All things to keep in mind if you are looking at long-term pumping.But for the occassional pump, it really works well.This pump works great!I didn't pump full time or anything, but it always got me more than I expected.I highly recommend this pump, don't waste your money on the more expensive ones!I purchased this for emergencies and for long trips in the car.It's easy to clean and affordable.Time will tell when it comes to durability, but I would highly recommend this product.The only thing is that this may not be good for women with large breasts since it's a one size fits all design.i purchased this pump and for me it was very uncomfortable (my nipples are too big i guess?)i ended up throwing it away and kept the Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump which came with two sizes and i could pump with one hand and feed my daughter on the other side at the same timeI waffled over which breast pump to get, because I work, but only part-time.Ultimately I decided against an expensive, space-consuming, energy-hogging electric pump and picked this one instead.Easy and comfortable to use, easy and light to transport, no need to worry about plugging it in or charging a battery, and it extracts enough milk that I can pump on my break time for the one feeding per day that I miss.I've never actually used an electric pump so I can't compare the amount of milk directly, I'm just saying it's enough to tide my baby over while I'm at work the next day.Also, it's easy to assemble and clean.Five stars here!buy it!way better than my electric pump of different brand that malfunctioned after 2 weeks of use.Lansinoh manual hand pump offers little suction.I tried it with and without the silicone insert, and there is little suction.A few times, I pumped nothing.However, if you are engorged with milk, this could prove to be useful (but so could expressing milk by hand).The manual pump is not useful for those with poor milk production.It does not compare to the $1800 hospital pumps.I didn't like this pump that much, but I reluctantly used it when my electric pump died.Now I love it and don't plan to go back to an electric.These are durable and an important replacement part for your AVENT pump.If you buy one of the corresponding pumps, you should really buy these also.With constant pumping, these need to be replaced every few months.These are inexpensive and very helpful in getting the most use out of your Philips AVENT breast pump.I spoke with Lisa at customer service who was polite.I told her that it was cheaper on amazon.com so I would just buy it there.Goodbye.I can't believe some people got these for free!!GOOD LUCK!they said only replace if cracked.I wasn't sure how to rate this because while the product is great, the fact that people are selling it on Amazon is really cruddy.THE PRODUCTWorks great and lasts long.Only con is that it gets spotty from water sucked in, but that can be cleaned (run rubbing alcohol through it or leave the pump running to get out most of the moisture).THE PRICEI'm SO GLAD I read the reviews.I called Medela and got new tubing for free (shipping too), no questions asked.Well, except for what year I bought it and whether it was the Pump and Style original or advanced.I just called, Aug 10 2010, and Medela is sending them to me for free.I may not have spent my money at Amazon today, but this is why Amazon is my go to place for almost everything I buy.I just read some of the other reviews that Medela customer service will give them to you for free!!Wow.... No more buying them!I am going to tell you some tips about this tubing though...Make sure you use the correct tubing for your pumps b/c they will not work correctly if you use other Medela tubes made for other pumps.It makes sense but I just thought it wouldn't matter.Well it kept stopping up my milk ducts so dont do it!Also, for people who have not used these breastpumps yet...These tubings are VERY cheaply made..Reminds me on how some cars spark plugs are meant to crap out on you after 30,000 miles....These tubes do not seal well.The plastic applicator that goes into the tube on one end always seems to come loose on me after about 11 times using it and once it comes out just throw it away b/c you dont get good enough suction.If you're anything like me you'll end up getting stopped milk ducts all the time!Lots of things I was never told...But I know everyone's boobs are different.This bag is spacious and confortable to carry.I always overpack but I can get everything I need in here and still have room!There are several roomy pockets on teh inside, a small snap closure pocket in the front and a pocket in the back of the bag.This is a great eco-friendly diaper bag and well worth the money!The only downside is that I ordered it in cafe but the color is more grey than brown.The outside is stylish enough that it doesn't look like a diaper bag.I love that it has 4-feet on the bottom.The bag could be slightly more stiff as it does tend to be floppy.Otherwise, I anticipate using this bag for many years, even after my daughter is no longer in diapers because it is so roomy and stylish looking.My bag is the black background with brown fleur de lis print.One note - the shoulder straps are not adjustable.Just something to keep in mind if you are particular about where the bag may hit on your torso.It's great for traveling, and I use it as a carry-on bag (in addition to our real diaper bag, which is a backpack).I also like that the company is environmentally conscience, and that the bag is eco-friendly and Phthalate free.They don't hold on the baby.And the feet are too small.The fabric is great, but totally not usable.We had a plastic mat underneath our high chair for the first two years for our daughter...It was very useful, the only downside being that it wasn't that attractive and things sometimes got under it.All in all it was fine and we replaced it because it was getting worn out, and we thought we would get something more attractive and fun.Enter the Splashmat - we put it under the high chair and gave it a go - but we expected it to be a little tougher and thicker so that we could move a chair on it without it bunching up, and that it would stay flat.It does not stay flat - Every time we pull the chair in and out it bunches up and wrinkles.Though we can straighten it out, it requires constant attention and re-laying.Not what we needed, and we have stopped using it and folded it away to use for picnics or as a beach throw, we guess.It's pretty and probably would be good for that, but fails as a under table mat to keep things clean.The mat is absolutely adorable but it does tend to bunch under the fisher price rainforest highchair.We wind up re-spreading it out before each use.That said it cleans easily and covers a wide area when it lays flat.And so far seems more durable than the baby Einstein mat.Great product - eco friendly, made in the USA, and free of harmful chemicals for children, pets, and adults.PLUS it's cute and functional.All in all I recommend this.I know that it will be used a lot in nasty public areas!There's a very expensive store that sells a crib skirt that is similar to this one, but over 7 times the cost!!!It is too long for my crib, which is already lowered & I had to slip it through two wooden beams on the sides of the crib, so it took some time & work.It also was not as long as the crib, but still works.I just pulled it through the back more so it looks better on the front.The one from the other store, people complained that it fell apart & for the cost that is ridiculous...I think with this one if my daughter destroys it I would not be upset, it's a very light material, but for the price & especially compared to other one's, just can't beat it!It is a soft pink, the inner layer looks white or really light pink.I bought this and the Carters soft bumper (has minky dots) and they go great together.I had a local seamstress monogram my little girls name on the bumper and it made a very cute and budget friendly set!This is the prettiest bumper I have ever seen!!:-)  Our bedding is better than ours!This gate is an extremely well designed infant gate.What I love is that not only is this a pressure gate, but you attach circular connectors to the wall (via sticky tape and screws).I tried pushing it over several times and I even fell against it once - it didn't budge.The one hand operation is simple and effective - you twist a knob.I'm very impressed with the gate.I like the feature which allows for the gate to swing both ways.I like how it comes with extensions.It fits well even if you don't have much wall space (the wall only juts out about 2 inches from our bottom step).I have no problems going through it while carrying my baby up or down the stairs.If you have the space, I would recommend The First Years Hands Free Gate over this one (it has a large foot pedal that may not fit small staircases).Our ten week-old daughter loves this mobile!(Check out the "Oklahoma Mom" picture that I posted here.)At first, she just looked at the mobile while it was still.Then, when she was about eight weeks old, we started using the music box.She loves it either way -- she talks to it and laughs at it all the time!We are still using the black and white shapes, since our daughter enjoys them so much.I'm looking forward to seeing how she likes the pictures of the faces as she gets older!I tried this totseat with my nearly 9 month old.It is a great harness if you need to keep them in place, but does not work with an average table and chair set.We like to offer puffs or mashed fruit at the table - this offers no place to put them.The baby sits on the regular seat and is, therefore, too low.I will be looking for something with a tray.I honestly see no point to this product.Contrary to other reviews, we've found that our 8 month old is at a good height when placed in the totseat in any normal chair.He cannot sit unassisted on the floor, but he is stuck in place in this harness.I do not worry that he will fall, though I was hesitant looking at the design.!LIKE:*low price*keeps baby in place (our baby can't sit unassisted yet but this held him in place)*folds up small (fits into my purse inside included storage bag)*machine washable/dryable*fits every chairDISLIKE:*wish they made an organic/eco-friendly versionWe have had the opportunity to use the totseat a couple times now.So far so good!We haven't had a problem with fit or security.It is made of very good quality fabric, and is really attractive.I like the mirror on the back cover too.Cons: Not a fan of the GIANT company logo on the back cover.Don't they know babies and toddlers will be playing with it?I liked the idea of the last page being a "mirror" for our babies to look at.That feature is nice, but the rest of the book is lower quality than I had hoped for.The plastic makes the pictures look somewhat cloudy.My mom bought this classic shape sorter for my one-year-old, and I think it's the best shape sorter toy.At first my daughter didn't show much interest (except for trying to chew the pieces), but now at 1 1/2, she can put the shapes in if you help her find the appropriate shape.It is rather difficult to get to the nether regions of your baby in this style of tub and the water cools off quickly.The biggest problem with this tub is that it is really too big for a newborn and too small not long after that.On the pro side it doesn't take up a lot of space and can be used as a toy bucket when baby is older.Luckily, I did lot of research about bath time options and happened upon this tub.The idea of a baby sitting down IN water, vs. spread out above the water, like traditional baby baths, made so much more sense to me.My baby had his first bath in this tub, and I was able to give it to him unassisted.This tub sold for almost half the price of all the other tubs like this.I bought it knowing there might be a reason why it's not as expensive as all the other tubs like this.I still can't find out why.I guess it's just the brand.My 1 month old bathes in it without crying and only cries when I take her out.I'm glad I didn't purchase the more expensive brand because I'm sure there would be no difference.Wait until baby is born.Mine had a dislocated hip and couldn't use it for a while.i took her out and learned my lesson.she spashes and grabs her duck....and actually gets clean!This is once again a product that is not needed at all.The washcloth is much better alternative.It actually stays in place.An adorable idea, seemingly ingenious, but in the end horribly executed and a waste of money.They make for a couple of cute pictures when your newborn is very small and still in the beginning, but as soon as they can move the product becomes more of a hassle than a help.We found placing a burp cloth/cloth diaper over top of them during changes worked just as well if not better.I honestly wish I had saved the money for something far more useful.We use these every time we go out.The wait staff appreciate it as well as cleanup is very easy.It might go without saying but we recently tried to stick it down on a table clothe and it did not stick.Not a big shocker but something to keep in mind.It has also left marks on one or two tables in the past.Well worth the price, some places sell them for more than others, so check around for the best deal.Easily sticks to any table to give child a clean place to eat.Great for using on park benches or picnic tables.Even sticks to the wooden ones!Ot those metal picnic tables with the holes, prevents food from falling to the floor.Hard to unpeel and mine never tried, colorful characters and pictures help keep mine entertained while waiting at a restaurant.Plus I don't have to worry he is going to throw the glass dish on the floor, I just put everything on the placemat, and take the plate away!My toddler loves to play hide and seek on the placemat,...we use salt,ketchup, sugar packets to cover up characters or items on the placemeat and he tries to find the correct item by looking under it.Another time waster that works!I throw one of these on and don't have to worry about it.Cute designs.The only thing that I don't like is that the container that it comes with is bigger than a wipes container.So it is bulky.I just take it out of the container and throw it in a zipped bag.I keep the container bags in the closet and refill as needed.The table topers and case meet my expectations, they are very nice and everything, but after I got it, I found out that they aren't as usefull as I thougth... Maybe when my baby becomes a toddler I'll use them more...Not sure how they would work with other bottles (if they fit other bottles) but with the Evenflo Classic glass bottles, they collapse during feeding, requiring them to be removed from baby's mouth to re-fill with air.They do not have any markings to indicate which are slow, medium or fast.So don't get them mixed up unless it does not matter to you what size you have.The only way to tell is put liquid in it and compare them.I'm sure it would be fine if all you want is to let your child sit in the carseat with a damp bathing suit... however, if accident protection is what you're after, this is useless.I have a Britax, and my daughter's first accident in her car seat leaked right through, wetting the cover underneath and the middle seatbelt material.Very irritating.I just ordered the Kiddopotamus Deluxe instead.Wish me luck.I put these on my twins' Britax Roundabout 50 car seats.These pads are thick enough to eliminate discomfort but still thin enough for the five-point harness to function properly.They don't interfere with tightening the straps.We actually got The First Years rack as well as the Munchkin drying racks, and neither was very useful.This Munchkin Drying Rack holds lots of "snap out" pieces that fit in the Medela bottle lids (to close off breast milk after you pump), but little else.We don't use the lids with the snap out pieces, so it was pretty useless for us.Dr. Brown's bottles didn't fit well at all.My wife took one look, tried to place a part or two and sent me back with it.The best rack we have found is from Prince Lionheart:http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00018XCJC/qid=1124937150/sr=8-6/ref=pd_bbs_6/002-3590167-9987266?v=glance&s;=baby&n;=507846It holds 8 bottles as well as other accessories on those same "projections"... it has places to dry the miscellaneous little parts of a breast pump and can fit the breast pump shields with no problem.A side by side comparison of the three racks makes it no comparison!Have not had problems with anything breaking or falling off.The drainage situation is not ideal, but for the price, this is a good drying rack.It has just enough slots for every piece of the bottle and I havent found anything wrong with it.These drying racks work great.I could never get all my baby's stuff dry by laying it on a paper towel, and these really help.However, some of the spokes are too close together which leaves some of them useless.Also it would be great if there were drainage holes in this.The water pools at one end of the rack.The suction doesn't stick to anything.My son barely touches the plate and it starts sliding.The lip would work well, IF the plate would stay suctioned in one spot, but it doesn't.This product is a disappointment.This would be such a superior product if the plate didn't come in three pieces.The suction also worked pretty well in the beginning but stopped working after some use (I only hand wash this so it couldn't be warped).I do really like the spoon and the rubberized, thick handles because it's easy for him to use.This would probably be a good set for a very young toddler learning to eat on his/her own for the very first time but doesn't really work well in the long run (my son grew out of it in a few weeks.Worst possible suction bowl/plate out there for your money.Munchkin Three Stay Put Suction Bowl 3-Packis much better.I don't expect any suction bowl to stick on if a determined toddler wants to pull it off and fling it.All I am looking for is the stay put feature to help them eat if they actually want to eat offof a plate or bowl.looks cute and guess I have a usable spoon and fork out of this deal...Not microwaveable - at least not past 10 seconds.It's a good little container on the go.Haven't tried it with snacks yet but lid seems to close snuggly.Can't beat the price!I've always loved these bowls and they're handy even when you don't use them for infant feeding anymore so they last a super long time.I purchased these over other options because they were BPA free.I'm making my own baby food and freezing it into cubes, and in the morning, I stick a cube in the bowl, snap the lid on, and it's thawed by the time the sitter feeds him.I don't know how they hold up in the dishwasher because I choose to handwash them, but like I said, these things are fantastic!I purchased these bowls because I wanted BPA-free products that I can use to transport food when we travel or eat out.The bowls hold 8oz and the lids snap on with a click and are not flimsy at all.I put them on the top shelf of the dishwasher and so far neither the lids or the bowls have changed form.I have two Boon Spoons which are great for purees but I use these bowls for thicker foods that I can't squeeze out of.When my baby gets older, these will also be great to hold dry snacks in too.Great product for the price, considering the Munchkin bowls are the same price without lids.The lids still fit perfect and the seal is so tight you can put liquid foods in them or keep dry foods (like cheerios, crackers) from getting stale.I like these bowls for home use, but they are a little big for packing in lunchboxes/backpacks.They are BPA free, dishwasher and freezer safe and the LID NEVER GETS LOST!Sure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * 4 Ounce/Half Cup/118mL - 2 Per PackSure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * TSA Airplane Friendly 1.5 ounce - 2 per packI would still highly recommend this product."Colors vary" - mine came in pink.Makes washing so quick and all my pieces look very clean.I end up with the nipple brush always out (not inserted into the handle) so not important to me that it can do that, I suppose it would be nice for travel.I keep it on my drying rack.After using a Munchkin "deluxe brush" for a few months of baby bottles washing (Medela brand, plastic), the bristles started flatening at the end and stopped doing their job.I decided to try this Munchkin "regular" brush that has a sponge tip instead of all bristles to see if it was making it easier to clean the bottom of baby bottles when a little formula powder or something else gets caked on.First, let me say that the sponge does not work better than bristles at removing product from the bottom of bottles.The bristle part of this brush is a lot less "hairy" than on the deluxe brush and so does a poorer job at cleaning the sides.All this would be OK if the overall quality was good.Unfortunately, after only 2 weeks of usage, this brush is already in very poor condition: the sponge end has started desintegrating into little pieces and there are not enough bristles to compensate once the sponge is gone.For me, this brush was not money well spent and, for only about a dollar more, I am going back to the deluxe model, which lasted over 6 months.I recommend you look at the other one too!It makes a lot of scrach on nipples.So overall I don't recommand it.Sponge fell apart after 1 week's of use.I would not buy this product again.I use it on all of my baby utensils as well.Reaches every nook & cranny.I just wish it had a suction cup at the bottom so I did have to hang it.On the other hand, it dries better if you just hang it on a hook.Less clutter at the sink, and out of the way.Great product!It tells you right on it that you shouldn't use for more than 30 days due to bacteria/germs.While I read the reviews on the nipple brush, I haven't noticed any issues after 2 mos of use.If that design flaw could be fixed, it would be PERFECT!buying 2nd one as demanded by wife - what more can i say.the pull out little brush can be used with nipples and breast pump parts.This is the best bottle brush I ever used to me is even better than the deluxe one that came with my bottle sterilizer for the microwave, cause of the sponge on the top does not spray all over the place like the deluxe does when I'm washing my standard Dr. Browns bottles, eventhough don't last long but it worth the price anyways you're not supose to use this for too long, you can't go wrong with this one.I'm not overly fond of the foam/sponge thing on the top, because it doesn't exactly scream "sanitary" - although it dries out pretty quickly.I have tried a couple of other formula dispensers and wasn't super impressed, until I got this one.The lid pops open easily (which was a problem with a couple of the other ones we tried) and doesn't seem like the formula mixes in with the other slots.I use it every time I'm on the go and use the single bottle dispenser for a quick trip to the store, or even sometimes at home, when I need a bottle fast.The only thing I wasn't completely thrilled with was the fact that I got a pink dispenser, wish I had a more gender neutral color, but I wouldn't rate the product down for that.I would recommend this product to anyone feeding formula to their child, wanting to go out at all.This is a must have if you are formula feeding.I haven't had any problems with the formula in the three section one spilling over - it works great!And it's handy to have both a small one and a bigger one for different situations.I'm very glad I have these!I don't spill any formula when mixing bottles away from home, and I can just throw these in the diaper bag with no worries.Then there'd be formula all in your diaper bag!Convenient for moms on the go.Great for baby bags without weighing it down with big cans of powdered formula.The single serving dispenser is a nice addition.Now you needn't waste your money paying extra for the individual formula to-go packets -- just fill up the slots in these dispensers and they are just as convenient without the added cost!I haven't used them for snacks yet, but I'm sure they will be just as handy for those!The single one is great, too, for a quick errand!I love these formula containers!!I don't leave home without them!!I tried a different brand before and the formula would move from section to section...this one doesn't do it at all!!Makes formula feeding that much more convenient!I got this initially because it had the single serving dispenser along with the 3 compartment dispenser and I thought it was the best deal.I have used thePhilips Avent Formula Dispenser / Snack Cup, BPA-Free, and this Munchkin one is much nicer.The cap is a bit tighter to open, which can be a pain, but I would call this a pro and not a con because there are less chances of spills in the diaper bag.Another thing that makes this nicer than the Avent, is that it has a funnel shaped lid that allows for ALL of the formula to come out of the compartment and not leave any behind like I found was a frequent problem with the Avent, having to shake, tap and jostle the dispenser to get out the last bit.If you don't line up the dividers of the compartments with the little grooves in the lid that show you it's locked in place, you may have formula from one compartment fall into the compartment you are pouring out, but I found this true with the Avent too.Overall I would say this is a great product, and a much better deal since you get the bonus single serving dispenser and it's pretty much the same price as the Avent.We have 3 sets of these, and use them every day.The design of the spout helps keep the formula from getting spilled.You can buy the Munchkin formula dispenser at many stores, but only Amazon includes the single serving container as well.She's bored with the toys with our current exersaucer and I'm glad they made these so we can get more usage out of it!The "stem" is a good material too, it is easy for them to pull the toy down to their mouth.We have an older excersaucer that my sister gave me that she used with her kids.It was missing a toy or two so I thought I'd be able to order this and plug it right in but it didn't work with our older saucer.I got this and no matter what temperature the water is, the word "HOT" shows up and doesn't go away.I love these cups for my toddler.They are spill-proof, easy to clean and can be run through the dishwasher, which is a definite plus.The only draw-back is that we've had some of the cups mold inside, so I would recommend either putting them in the fridge or emptying them out at night, etc.However, they're cheap to replace.- they are waaay too high to be useful as snack traps.- once they get gross with soggy goldfish there is no way to clean them because they stay permanently attached.So unlike other strollers where you can easily pop out the snack tray and hose it off in the sink, this one stays gross & you have to do your best with wet wipes.- it makes the folded configuration a little thicker- if the kids are buckled, the tray is so high they can't reach it.(this goes with my first point)- it is soooo difficult to install & one screw on mine constantly falls off so I finally just left it off.- too expensive- it's impossible for the kids to climb in.a 2 year old & 4 year old both have the same problem.So I have to lift my heavy 4 year old &  2 year old in EVERY TIME.lift them in, lift them out, lift them in, lift them out.and it's not just a short lift, you have to lift them high up and they have to contort themselves to fit under it.awful design.Bob folks - you gotta fix this.this design hasn't changed for years.Change the seats so they sit straight upright and add a snack tray that will funcion as a snack tray.It doesn't fit all infant car seats though (like the Chicco) so we did have to borrow a seat from a friend.Cup holder also doesn't fit all size drinks.I bought this knowing my car seat was not on the approved list (Combi Shuttle-original up to 22lbs version) but it fits!it was a small project to put on, and the thread lock tube was empty but I'm glad it was because now I can take off the adapter if I ever want to sell it or just not use it.So..if you ever want to take the adapter off, my dad said to skip the thread lock step :).My 3 year old can climb right under the tray on his side to get in and out.Why on earth does this adapter hold only one car seat?It's for a DUALLIE.I have twins, and that renders this accessory completely useless to me.What a waste.Seriously, don't buy anything else.The bent handle was easy for my son to grasp, helping him learn to feed himself.These spoons have been great!She really likes the colors and handles these quite a bit.My wife does believe we will have to get her a more point to them as the fork is sort of too wide for her mouth, but these seem to be good for the time being.Her mother also liked them better than the ones she had at home so I gave her one of the sets.I liked these at first but now I don't like them as much because my 3 year old sometimes likes to step on them causing damage to the trim they are screwed into.They cannot support the weight because they do not bend.I've also had one break, but the main issue is the damage when these get stepped on.Keep that in mind.Also, I wouldn't call these "soft".Scented dog bags would work as well.Will use those when I run out.Cheaper...Smell nice though...I use these bags with the dispenser (sold separately) almost every time I go out with my baby.I was expecting each bag to be small and maybe only hold 1-2 diapers but the bags are large and can fit multiple diapers and an entire outfit if necessary.The bags contain diaper odors and wetness very well.I wouldn't go anywhere without these bags.I agree with all the other reviewers that this seller is way overpriced.I made the mistake of thinking I was getting a bulk product but received only one package.What a rip off!I use these Evenflo classic mainly for storing breast milk.I wanted something non-plastic and this is the one.Like all the reviews said, these bottles fit Medela pumps and you can pump directly into these glasses and put them in the freezer!These bottles are so thick that I am not worried about breaking them at all when I have to carry them to places.I have both 8oz and 4 oz bottles.When my baby was first born, he demonstrated a clear distaste for these bottles.Now he likes it!I like that the nipple is made of silicone.The glass bottle eliminates the BPA worry and makes for a nicer looking bottle.I have never had an issues with breakage.The glass seems pretty thick and shatter resistant.The ounce markings on the side of the bottle are hard to see, especially at night since they are just raised and not marked but this also eliminates the paint risk so I am okay with it.I would recommend buying one or two to try and see what your baby likes.My baby had colic when he was born and has always had gas issues.These have helped relieve some symptoms.The straw holders are ineffective - more straws than not end up at the bottom of the dishwasher, unfortunately.I really like my basket for the dishwasher.The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because there is no way you can fit a nipple in each slot!I used Avent nipples/bottles and I could only put a nipple in every other hole.The product worked great otherwise.The basket stayed latched all through the cycle in the dishwasher and the items got clean each time.I have several of these that I purchased from stores (Babies R Us and Target).During the first few uses, the top snapped off and it continued to snap off in subsequent uses.Although it was pretty easy to snap it back in, it was annoying that it kept happening.This product is more sturdier in stores and the store version comes with a tiny extension basket to hold spoons which this online version doesn't have.The top has never snapped off of the store versions either.The plastic on the online version was a bit thinner too.All of that aside, it held up in the dishwasher much like the store versions.However, I only used it for two weeks so I really can't tell how long it will last.We got this basket on a whim at the baby store--not sure why we picked this one instead of one of the other handful there, but we did.And it has served us well for 18 months so far.At first, with the bottles, nipples, and pump parts...through to sippy cups...and now to straw cups.I really don't like that I can't fit the bigger straw cup tops (like these:Playtex Lil' Gripper Straw Cup  9 oz) in the top section...BUT, the fact that it has the little flip-down straw-holders is a definite bonus.I just went looking for a bigger one that might work better with the straw cup tops, but none of them looked any better than this--or had a neat system for the straws.Inexpensive way to help you clean your bottles and nipples in the dishwasher.nice idea but a waste of time.takes up a lot of room in your dishwasher and you can't fit that many things in the basket.if you use playtex nurser nipples or wider nipples like the playtex nursers, then don't expect to use each hole on top for a bottle nipple.this product is a waste of space and more of a hassle than anything.I don't have any regular nipples so I can't tell you if they fit as suggested in the picture or not, but it fits about 6 wide mouth nipples in the top if you are good at strategically placing them.If you are using the niples that it shows in the pic you are fine but i use playtex and they don't seem to fit.It does hold bottle parts and nipples but just doesn't seem to fit great in my dishwasher... (I have a totally normal upgrade dishwasher) and this basket seems to tilt and not stay upright on the shelf.I always have to adjust it before I put things in it which is pretty annoying.Good product!I don't know that it's the design, I have tried to find a sippy cup my 11 month old would use... and this was the 4th one I've tried.Good for an older baby... a bit tough for my 7 month old... he prefers the ones with handles.The flap covering the zipper does flip up, but doesn't get in the way of the little one.Great concept...i was so excited to buy these sheets, but they are too big.I washed and dried them (low heat) and they still remain too big for my colgate classica mattress.Wish there was a way to adjust them.ADDENDUM (several mos later):Well, i just got over the fact that they are a little big and after my daughter was 4 mos, i used them regularly and the more they got washed and dried, the better it seems to fit.The QuickZip Sheet Set is a great idea--easy to use, and great quality.However, the set only comes with one base and one top sheet, so you have to buy a separate spare top sheet for those "middle-the-night" bedding changes that this product is supposed to ease.That adds up to a lot of money.Plus, these aren't waterproof, so you have to buy their mattress pad (which did poorly in other customer reviews) or another brand of waterproof pad.Again, more money.I found a product called ZipSheets at [...] and they are better in every way.They were on sale for $49 and included the base and TWO top sheets (called piddle pads), which are WATERPROOF with a hospital grade barrier fabric!Their webiste does a side-by-side 7-point comparison to four similar products, and the ZipSheets are clearly superior.Unfortunately Amazon doesn't sell ZipSheets, but should.You can still add them with the Universal Wish List.Plus, they offer the same product for twin-size beds, which I shared with a coworker who is caring for a sick elderly parent who is incontinent.One last thing, QuickZip doesn't offer flannel top sheets, which are a must in winter, in my opinion.I'll probably do the same with the ZipSheets.Good luck!We didn't know it wouldn't work with cloth diapers because of the crazy way the bags are cut.(I personally think this is a waste of plastic concerning the bags, and the cutting mechanism takes up a lot of space in the actual diaper pail...)  My husband saw this at BabiesRUs and we took it out of the box to check it out.I'm glad we did, because it has been a great addition to our cloth diaperig regime.Instead of using the included plastic bags, I put a Thirsties diaper pail liner in there.Smell doesn't seem to be an issue, since the top is sealed with a rubber gasket, and it works way better than having just a liner that we had hanging on the door - husband complained of smell after only one day.The only issue I have is that the door seemed to be getting a bit stuck this morning, not wanting to fully close - and we've only had the pail for 2 days.I bought this wrap after researching different types of slings and carriers.It kept her secure and freed my arms.However, I noticed that it was a pain to put on and being petite (5'2") every time I was putting it on the fabric would touch the floor.This came really annoying when I tried to use it at the mall.Most of the fabric was in the floor getting dirty.Another problem was that no matter what I did I always looked like a Jedi from Star Wars (LOL!).Currently, I use a Bjorn (the one w back support) outside the house and the moby inside (I want to get something out of the money I spent).My girl was able to fall asleep while I held her in there which was nice for when we were out and about and even just doing things around the house.The wide straps allow for maximum comfort and because the fabric stretches out across the shoulders, it helps relieve some of the strain on the back.It also leaves me hands-free to do chores or whatever.She hates the car seat so whenever I go to a store I just put her in the wrap instead of the stroller.Only reason I gave it a 4 is that it's not as easy to put on as say the Ergo carrier or Bjorn.You have to put the wrap on before you leave the house since it's like 9 feet long and you don't want the wrap to drag on the dirty ground.What a 'sleepy time' life saver these sheets are!They are soft, durable, and never cold which is great when the weather turns.We were having problems with our baby waking back up when we put her to sleep on cold cotton sheets.Now when we lay her down to sleep, she snuggles her face against the sheets and passes right out.Once I pulled them out of the packaging I noticed how soft they were yet durable.They held up in the washing machine which is always a plus.I was a little hesitant to buy a brand online I wasn't used to since I've never seen these in the stores but they turned out to be very nice, maybe even a little better then the Gerber brand.I would definitely recommend this product, and you can't beat the price.I love the cute sayings on these, and that's about as far as it goes.They are so thin they couldn't possibly absorb much after bath time.I suppose you get what you pay for..My daughter was breast-fed and they are the only ones she perfers.So you shouldn't have as much problems as one reviewer says about keeping it clean.My daughter has two bottom teeth now and chews on it constantly.SEND IT BACK.Dont chalk it up to a bad design or unsafe.I would definantly recomend these pacifiers!Out of all the different pacifiers we tried, theses are babys' favorites.Don't waste your money on others.Something about the shape of the nipple is supposed to more closely resemble the real thing.My only other complaint is that they have a way of disappearing (I have 6 but can never find more than 2 at any given time), but I have a feeling that's not the paci's fault:)However, it is too heavy for her to hang on to at 4 weeks.I am shocked at how many people like this pacifier clip.Even though it is really cute, I found it incredibly bulky, big and basically unusable.I agree with the other reviewers.This was too big and heavy for our baby.The pacifier just fell out of her mouth and she got frustrated.I gave it two stars instead of one because it makes a great chew toy!First off, $20 is way too much for this, I got mine at target for about a quarter of the price.My 8 month old tolerates it, but prefers the soothie without it.We're going to try a different brand and see if it's better.We've had this playmat for about 3 months and we really like it.it is easy to clean and configure.we ended up buying 2 sets to cover most of our baby's playroom.I love this mat.He's now 2 and I'm back to buy another one, our third, for the baby we're expecting.We ended up buying a second one for his room to make it even bigger.I never had any problems with smell and it's very durable -- it's lasted through two years of heavy use and still looks almost new.I also really appreciate that this mat is made especially safe for babies.This is one of the favorite products I bought for my son and I'm excited to get another one for our next baby.It does have smell but only took 1 day to be completely gone.The tiles are truly stylish and give a good cushion for the baby to sit and crawl on.I just lined the 2 sets up side by side.They are quite easy to clean.I usually first dust it with Sweefer then spray BabyGanic all purpose cleaner on them and wipe clean.They are expensive, but if you are patient, Amazon sometimes would drop the price to around $60perfect for our needs -- we use it only when we travel (leave the baby sleeping in a bedroom and hanging out with friends/ relatives in the living room/ or in the yard) or when we are at home and have music on in the living room and she is sleeping in the bedroom.We do not use it when we are sleeping in the night, since our bedroom is right besides her room and we can hear any mid/loud sound she makes very easily without a monitor.voice activation works well (though it does fire up for a few seconds every once in a while, since we use a white noise maker) -- good rangeThis model came highly recommended, but I use a noise machine in the baby's room and it makes the monitor list at high levels of noise at all times - and there is way too much background noise to hear the baby.I have this monitor and it has really bad interference.It makes loud popping/cracking static noises at night that would take me up for nothing.I even hear some strange man talking for 5 seconds once.Tried several channels, simply can not find a channel that is interference free.This product will go back to SONY tomorrow.I totally would not recommend this.I have been through my share of monitors and this one is by far the best!It holds its charge for a long time and I haven't had any interferance at all.Very much worth the money!Skip the cheap monitors and go straight for this one- you'll save money in the long run!Nothing fancy.What you get is 900MHz frequency baby monitor that works.Zero signal warning, in case your monitor is not turned on, on different channel as receiver, or out of range.This is a quality monitor at a decent price.It works very well and has come in extremely handy at home and while traveling.4 Stars - The voice activation feature works great when we don't use the white noise machine.Unfortunately, our baby won't sleep without white noise, so it is picked up on the monitor in either setting and we must listen to the white noise while we sleep as well.It doesn't bother me but certainly annoys my husband.works great - never had a single problem and puts my mind at ease!After reading lots of reviews i decided on this monitor.Our house is not that big and i did not really see the need in a monitor but wanted to be safe.So far (6 months later) i am so glad i bought this one!The price was so reasonable and i've had no issues with it.The rechargable battery does not last that long (and the warning sound is piercing!), 24 hours maybe, but i just keep it plugged in, no issue.Definitely would recommend this one if you are looking for a basic, reliable monitor!UPDATE Oct'10:  So far still works great.No issues whatsoever.It is very afordable and seems very well made.It will even pick up sounds in the other room with the door closed.The only problems we have had is it will pick up weird noises when close to a cell phone.The tags on it really do attract their little fingers.I brought this home when I was 30 weeks pregnant and suffering from back pain.My husband was able to set it up very quickly and said it was easy to assemble.I sat down in the chair and didn't get back up for over an hour.It is very comfy.The chair glides/rocks smoothly and reclines in the same fashion as a beach chair (by adjusting the arms).The cherry wood matches the crib's cherry wood.It would be nice if the cushions were a bit thicker to help with any potential flattening over time.However, at this point in time, they are plenty thick.We ordered this chair for our nursery.I like that it can change angle depending on how you want to sit at that moment... sitting up for my wife to nurse or leaning back for rocking Elsie to sleep.The assembly was easy enough to do.The padding on the chair and arms is nice.We had an issue with one of the arms not locking into place... the one side would catch but the other side kept popping loose.But this is still a 5 star review because the company stands behind their product.I called Shermag and the person on the phone was very nice (maybe because it is a Canadian company they are nicer?)and asked that I email all the information.So I took a couple pictures and sent everything to them... within an hour I had a response that they would ship me new arms.The new arms arrived and now the chair is works just fine.So, even if you get a bad part the company will still take care of you.Makes this a great chair and a safe buy.... and the PRICE is great.Don't buy one of these chairs at a box store known fo-R- baby products... they mark them up like $150 and the quality doesn't look any better than these.Thanks Shermag!The back has 3 positions that are adjusted by lifting the arms of the chair and placing them into notches - can pinch your fingers if your not careful.Bottom line, I really like the chair and it was a great price.This thing doesn't work.Period.The front part goes up, like a duck's bill, thus defeating the purpose of the product: to block the sun from hitting your baby.It's big and bulky, too.Total waste of money.It gives just enough when you press on it.The mattress sinks more than i would expect under the weight of a 12 pound baby.It arrived with a tear in the packaging and some black scuff that came right off with a wet cloth.It fit the standard sheets and covers.I like the print on it as well.I purchased this mattress after reading many reviews - I didn't want to spend too much on a mattress, but I wanted it to be a good one.It's not too expensive but is a great mattress.The mattress arrived very quickly and was exactly what I was hoping for.I read a lot of reviews and was scared that it would be too soft like some said or that it would be defective but I was very excited when it arrived and was perfect!It is very firm and fits perfect in our DaVinci Kalani Convertible Baby Crib!I would recommend this mattress!I like it because my son can't get his fingers between crib and mattress but it makes replacing the sheets an ordeal.Additionally, it runs a little larger than the average mattress (we had a different mattress that we got for free with the crib that was a few inches smaller on the side), so it fits VERY snugly in a standard crib.In fact, we have to lift the mattress out a little just to get the sheet on, which can be a pain if you have a crib bumper but is comforting to know that the baby can't get his hands stuck between the mattress and crib.10 stars!The arch is flexible, so you can lower it for baby to reach toys.I attach it to the bassinet during the day, to the crib too sometimes.One of my top 5 best purchases for my first baby.My son loves this so much that he broke it in about 3 months.It's pretty sturdy toy, don't get me wrong.Had my first kid and saw this on sale for $16 from Amazon and had a great review.Pretty much any surface that is less than about 1 1/2 to 2 inch thick you can attach this.It's got joints so you can twist it to go on lots of different things.My son didn't care much for his bouncer attachment so I put this arch instead of the bouncer toy and presto.(which is the reason this broke).Well it's not broken.I'd hand him the ball and help him pull which caused the pin wheel to turn.He'd look at the ball then the pin wheel and the ball again trying to figure it out.And he eventually did after awhile.The the rubber part ripped and he grew out of the bouncer and he got millions of other toys so I forgot about it.and he has forgotten about the ball and the pinwheel.So it took him awhile to realize that pull the ball = wheel go around.Great toy.Friend who came over to my house asked about it.It's exactly as pictured.My baby loves looking at all the things.He hasn't started playing with it yet.(He hasn't even discovered his hands.hahaha!)We've attached it to his car seat, the high chair, the swing (he got tired of looking at the animals on the swing's mobile already), and even the pack-n-play.Definitely worth it!UPDATE:  So my baby boy finally discovered his hands now.He loves staring at the sun and the butterfly, and now he's reaching to grab it.Keeps him entertained while in the high chair and swing.I REALLY love how you can detach it and attach it to so many different things.Ordering it for friends' baby showers now!!I am SOOOOO glad i decided to try this out.The sides are very wide so i wasn't sure if this would fit on them or if it would stay on it and SURE ENOUGH IT DOES!!!she pulls on it and everything and it never comes off, longs you tighten it up like you are suppose to.It has helped keep her from crying while being in the car.I love that you can adjust it to make it lower if you need to like for my daughter right now because she's so tiny and can't reach very far.I am going to get a second one to go on my stroller that also has no way to attach the normal toys or toy bars too since i live in japan and the strollers are not made like the American ones with things to attach toys to.it fits on his cradle and his car seat, and I'm sure you could figure out other places, the clamps extend and are soft so you don't have to worry about hurting the surface you attach it to.The only thing i thought was weird (but not worth knocking a star off) was that the picture is slightly different from the actual product.the middle dangly toy is non-existent, just the butterfly and the ball are on it.the red pieces of ribbon on the sun and hanging ball aren't on the toy either.So, the picture has more pizzazz than the actual toy.This toy arch has been a lifesaver for us!Our son went through a phase when he hated riding in the car and would just cry the whole time.I tried so many different things and wasn't too successful until I found this.This clips to just about everything.For outings it gets clippped to the car seat when we're in the car.Then it gets clipped to the kelty back pack, the wagon, the conoe, the kayak, or whatever else we can think of.It is the best baby toy ever!The clip on the one side snapped off.H e is the type of baby that needs to be held during the day so he will take a nap...He is currently ten weeks old and loves looking at it.He is also starting to reach out for it as well.I have also put it on his bassinet and he loves staring at it.He loves the spinning wheel and the mirror in the flower.He also likes looking at the sun and if we are in the car and the little balls start to rattle - he will stare at those as well.I had tried those tag-along chimes and he was not interested in them at all.I have the graco snugride 32 and I'm able to clip it on without issue.Anything that keeps my son from crying gets 5 stars!!love this thing!I bought this product when my baby was 2 months old and he did not seem interested in it.I thought it was a waste of money at the time.But when baby turned 5 months old, I pulled it out again and he loves it.He is a "hold me" baby, but with this product, spends 30 minutes playing with it, especially likes the fan and noise ball.Its very easy to attach to the car seat, bouncer, and high chair.It bends in several different places to maximize height and let down lower so baby can easily reach the different features on the toy.They love spinning the ball and turning the 'little fan'.It also has a little mirror hanging from the sun.This is a very cute, and sturdy toy!!!I use it when I'm traveling, need to make supper (as they will play with for 30 minutes or more!)This is a definite must if you are looking for something different to attach to other toys (car seat, bouncy, etc...) You will wonder how you ever lived without it!!I also like how I can so easily transfer it to many other things.I agree with other reviewers that this product has many uses.I have attached it to playard, car seat, stroller, bouncer, and swing.He laughs out loud when he sees me attach it to wherever he is sitting.After 4 months he still has not tired of it and plays with it constantly.A must have in my opinion.She will grab it to make it stop the let it go and on and on.Often she falls asleep holding onto it.Plus, there's a drawer for small items like diaper rash cream and q-tips.The mat is plastic which allows for quick and easy clean-up.We keep this in the den for quick changes.It hold everything, unpacks easily with one hand, and stores discreetly when not in use.These are my favorite burp cloths!They are so nice and thick, my baby is a very messy eater but his shirt is never wet when I use my JJ Cole burp rags.I love the curve because it fits perfectly by my neck when I put it over my shoulder.I would recommend these to anyone.!These are the best burp cloths ever - hands down!1) extremely large in comparison to other burp cloths2) incredibly soft3) contours the shoulder well4) great coverage (our son is a spitter-upper so we use them all around the house and in the stroller)5) stands up well to washingWill definitely be giving these at every baby shower from now on!I bought this fishing set for my 2 yr old daughter and she does really like it a lot.We got this about a week ago and she is still running around with the pole.I do not find it to be as great as I thought it would be for 2 reasons.Whoever said in their review that the little fish/crab/starfish "click" nicely to the hook is not correct, these things barely have enough magnet to attach.It is a cute set, and worth the $8 I suppose.Also the other reason I don't like this is the HUGE worm on the hook.It is bigger than anything else and serves really no purpose.The whole hook piece in general needs to be rethought.This was a great add on and works really well.The zip mesh pocket is a nice touch.It even works with our Joovy Kooper's split handles (it doesn't have one long straight rail) so if you are worried about it slipping on that kind of stroller it doesn't seem to have any problems on ours.Cheap, easy to use, holds a decent amount of stuff.But one of the straps broke after a few months and now it's useless.I'd sorely missed a place to put my stuff while walking!It does the job well and I have it situated to where it doesn't swing when walking.It easily holds a LOT of stuff and attaches even to the wide BJ handle.and for $8, you can't beat the price or storage it comes with.it can hold up to 5 drinks and has a great zippered compartment for valuables.i was looking for a drink holder for my stroller and an attachment for just one drink was over $8, so this is by far the best.i purchased two for both of my chicco capri strollersI searched high and low for a cupholder for my Uppababy Vista 2010, and I stumbled upon this one.I read all the reviews on Amazon and I'm so glad that I purchased it.It's less expensive then the cupholder that Uppababy offers, and it's so much nicer!I love the fact that it can hold 2 drinks (one for me and one for my hubby- or later on, my baby's sippy cup!), and I like the storage compartment in the middle- great for putting snack, keys, cell phone, sunglasses, whatever!It even has a small zippered compartment that's barely visible from the pictures.Great product for the price.Haven't had any problems with it.I can't believe we lived without this for so long!The BJ attachment was expensive, so I was so happy to read the reviews on this and find out how well it worked.Very sturdy and stable for drinks and made of tough material.An employee of a stroller rental company stopped us outside of our hotel to ask us about our Buggy Buddy.He loved the way this one was made and was going to look into it for their rentals.Would definitely recommend it!I got this to go with the Britax light-weight stroller.I would recommend this.i've been looking for a better one and still haven't found it.it holds my keys, blackberry, coffee, sippy cups and much more.It does tip forward and backward a bit though so an open cup would probably spill.I do have to undo one of the velcros to fold up the stroller, but that's no big deal.Happy to have a place to put my drink while we stroll!It fits my UPPA VISTA stroller very well.It's a difficult stroller to fit with a caddy because the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them.Considering the price, the material is really good and insulated.The cup holders are large enough to fit a coffee cup (which will sit upright) and you can fit larger water bottles in there because they are stretchable.My 2 umbrella-style strollers had no cup holders and this product solved that problem.To fold the strollers I just un-Velcro one side of the Buddy, flatten it, and tuck it into the stroller fabric.Since it is all fabric, it can be tricky getting a paper coffee cup into the holders, but just leave the cardboard cup-cozy in the holder- works great!Also has plenty of room to hold small snacks, napkins, tissues....  Best of all, I bought 2 for the price of one other brand holder.I simply love it!Just got it today and it is roomie and very durable!cant wait to start to use it!It's a great product and I haven't had any problems with it.BUT if you forget to take it off before folding the stroller it gets bent horribly and its hard to flatten back out.THEN one of the straps came off after only 3 weeks of use.I sewed it back on, but it was hard to go throught the thick material.I wish it worked better, its a great ideaWhen I was looking at a parent compartment to add, I really didn't want to spend a whole lot of money, and didn't like the cost/design of the parent console sold by Baby Jogger so I bought this one.My one and only hesitation in buying this was that it attaches by velcro and we all know that velcro can fail over time.I have not had this problem with this at all.I use the "buggy buddy" all the time for drinks of all sizes, keys, little toys, etc.I thought they would sag under the weight of my fully filled Klean Kanteen bottle, but they did not.The product appears to very well made, especially considering the low price.I have to say that for the price this cannot be beat.We can bring a bottle of water (or 2), cell phone, keys, sunglasses, and still have room to put the dogs retractable leash in there too.The material to me is just the right thickness its not too thick so it will restrain movement but at the same time allows for enough protection in my case-if it is for crawling baby that goes outside then these might not be the best.They do stay in place as well.I bought this bag for my toddler's daycare lunches because i was seeking a bag that would be BPA-free.We got the bunny model.Also, when you unzip this bag, the "placemat" you get is shaped like male genitals--a bit scandalous, but above all completely impractical.I'd say in the future I would buy any of the other models, which are more rectangular and can probably fit better in a bag, give less trouble stacking containers within, and probably unfold into a somewhat usable rectangular placemat.That said, i would not buy again.The exterior is coated with a plastic film (much like the film that use to cover old paperbacks) that started peeling off at the seams within a month.It is now peeling in big stretches all over the outside of the bag--and of course, your toddler will not hesitate to pull and make things worse.More importantly, the zipper was always awkward and within six months it has broken beyond repair.The inside is coated with that shiny silver plastic that may contain lead in it--it cleans well, but not worth the safety concerns.Last of all, the insulation is pretty poor.This bag is thinner than others I've had before, and it does not seem to have much insulating material at all, Unlike what happened with other bags, the icepack I put in melted before his lunch came up.Not a big deal (yogurt and other cold items were still relatively cool), but also not ideal.The bottom line is, the zipper is a goner and the outside is peeling and now the bag is getting scratched.I have to buy a new bag, and it's only been six months.I'll be going with a crocodile creek or a skip hop lunchie next.They are not as cute, but they seem more durable, better insulated, and are also pvc and bpa free.Fits great, doesnt get all loose and bunched up.Makes the crib softer, but not fluffy, which is exactly what I was hoping it'd do.This is really more of a mattress pad than a sheet.One think I have noticed is that it can pull the pack and play "mattress" together and leave a bit of a gap in the corners... not a huge deal but worth knowing.I tried to use it on non Graco pack and play and it did not fit well.This did not shrink when I washed and dryed it.great cover.I liked this pillow for support between my knees, but I'm not sure how well it supports the belly!I was so excited to get this pillow.The thought of a good night's sleep brought sheer excitment!When I got the pillow I was disappointed with the material of the pillow cover.It's not soft like you would think a pillow should be.I had intended to use the straight portion to cushion my belly while using the curl of the candycane to support my knees/hips and hopefully reduce the number of pillows I was using (3 at the time).Well, in order to get support for my belly, my knees way overshoot the pillow and it leaves my knees hanging on nothing.No matter which way I turn this pillow it is awkward.Now I'm using two regular pillows and then this giant one instead of the original three regular pillows.I'm sure my husband enjoys that I've taken over the entire bed!I am a stomach sleeper, and of course, being about 6 months pregnant at the time I bought this pillow (now 8), I couldn't really sleep on my stomach anymore.And they recommend you sleep on your side when you are pregnant anyway.I had to find something to help me stay on my side.This pillow looked like exactly what I wanted.I didn't want the kind of pillow where you have to use it under your head, too.I bought this because I could use it upside down with the curve between my knees.This pillow is good, but there are a couple things I would change.It is kind of firm and overstuffed for my taste, but that's a matter of personal preference.I also wish it was longer.I wanted full body support and to be able to hug the pillow, but this one only comes up to my chest/top of my stomach.This is the main thing I don't like about the pillow.I chose to keep it, but ended up buying a Snoozer pillow that is much longer and I like it better.I will probably use this pillow later when I am not pregnant and don't need to full body support.I can also see using it to breastfeed.I don't think this is a bad product.That is mostly my fault.I looked at the picture and assumed it was long enough, but didn't read the actual dimensions that were listed.It think if you aren't looking for full body support, or are shorter in stature than me (although there aren't too many who are, lol), then this pillow would work fine for you.Hence, I am giving it a good review.I am coming back here to add to this review now that my son is 9 months old.I didn't end up using this pillow much to sleep with, but it worked out great for breastfeeding!I am new to cloth diapering so this was one I wanted to try.The hook and eye tape is stiff yet lets loose easier than many of the others I have and it's REALLY bulky between his legs.I noticed he tries to roll less and kicks less when he had this on because it really is too much diaper between his legs.Our primary use of this diaper is for a reusable swimming diaper because it's less stiff between his legs when it's wet.I'm hoping the extra use and movement when wet will help soften it and make it less bulky between his legs.These are super soft and very absorbent!Also, I like the more conical shape, it tends to show less through bras.I take them out of the dryer and they are all crumpled/wrinkled up.But still a great product and I do recommend them!As a nursing mom, I would prefer to use washable nursing pads to save money and decrease waste.But what options do we moms have?Each one offered slightly different products.I'm working to test each product I can get a sample of.I believe most products fit one or more specific needs."White/patterns" absorb a bit faster than "natural" so I like to put "natural" as an outer doubler and "white/patterns" as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine.Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable, free samples, and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted.No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling.All samples were used at least a month before final opinions were noted.Categories: dry shirt test, rate of

and it turned out to be the perfect toy for him!He loves chasing after it and grabbing its tail.I like that you don't have to turn it on and off.The gate requires a level to install because if it is off in any direction it will pop off and it does so with a good amount of stored energy.This is due to the top bar being bent out slightly to give it a super snug fit when installed.The first time the gate popped out of place was when our Newfie, who is not accustomed to hardwoods, slid head first into it after attempting to get to some guests at the front door.The gate flew out about 4 feet, the tension screws another 4 feet.After that I immediately measured and re-setup the gate using the screw-in holders.Hopefully this will alleviate any future problems.I would recommend that everyone use these little pieces due to the amount of tension placed on the gate.Regarding installation:  It would be nice if the extension pieces could snap in or screw in in some way.They're really easy to use and appear to be very durable.Just got this in the mail today.It smells awful straight out of the package -- a strong, plastic-y odor.I've washed it more times than I could count and it's still in great shape.I will be using it as a sheet saver in anticipation of newborn poopy blowouts.The cloth part of the pad is soft and cute whereas the backing looks to be and claims to be waterproof.When my son was little I used it under his sheets in his porta-crib (the cotton side is soft and not sweaty).Soft flannel and well made!My baby likes the gym!Granted I have bought extra links that hang down and have other toys that I attached to it as well but overall my daughter likes it.I put the mirror up in the center of the beams of the gym and she will talk talk talk to it.I like it overall and could point out the little things that are not as great but really it doesn't matter because my daughter really likes playing on it regardless if the music is playing or not.BEWARE:  The ocean discovery cards featuring real life images of 6 underwater animals have "stickers" on the plastic circles which can be chewed off.I took these attachments away, but absolutely love everything else about the gym.I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.The colorful mat gave him a great incentive to want to be on his tummy.The octopus is designed very well because it hangs above his head but he can pull it down and it reaches perfectly to chew on.The music is less annoying than most toys.I thought this gym looked entertaining and wanted it for my son.I was so excited to get it for my shower.old and he never plays with it.There are one or two toys I detached from it and I give him to play with from time to time as rattles that aren't big hits with him.The lights/sounds/music that can attach to a crib was the ONLY good thing about this toy.It also plays for a long time.Worked wonders when he was a newborn.Also, the flimsy little mirror gave him some fun when I hooked it to his crib.But other than that, I would not recommend it.Buy a mirror and crib toy for cheaper.He ended up getting a lights and sounds type gym that grows with kids as they age from someone else and uses that as his play gym instead - so he likes the idea of an activity gym, just not this one.My 6 week old loves it.He is entertained for an hour just kicking and cooing.This is a great play mat!When she's not already in a fussy mood, my almost 3 month old really enjoys lying on her back and playing on this Neptune Play Gym.She enjoys the music because when it stops, she starts hollering and gets aggravated (lol).The music flashes lights and runs for a decent amount of time (I think 10 mins or so).You can actually throw the mat in the washing machine and dry it on a low setting (love that).You can also use the extra loops to hang other toys/rattles from the top of the activity gym.My 4mo old likes this activity mat but it doesn't hold his attention as much as I hoped for.He is amazed the first 10min or so then loses interest.The lights and sounds/music are great and an added bonus is that you can detach it and hook it to their crib or carrier.I already had a Lamaze Playhouse Gym and wanted something that would give my daughter room to move/roll on.You definitely need to read the directions to put this together though but it wasn't terrible.My daughter likes although she doesn't really grab or things yet but we're working on it!As for tummy time - she still hates it!And the whale pillow slides all over the place which doesn't make tummy time any easier but oh well...it's serving it's purpose right nowWorst play mat ever.I can't even believe what they charged for this piece of crap.The toys are super lame.The lights are off to the side.The rods won't stay level.The "tummy time" cushion is so cheap I tossed it in the trash.This entire line just screams Made in China GARBAGE!Keeps baby busy.Flaps and colors on mat are good for tummy time.You can add your own toys to this and it folds for easy storageWhile she isn't using the mat anymore, she still loves the toys!The music/light up toy is her favorite.My daughter went on it for hours a day.Unfortunately she hated tummy time so we didn't really use it for that.We never used the whale pillow and we barely used the plastic cards with the real life pictures.And we had it set up correctly.The poles need to be parallel, not crossed.Once she learned how to roll over we were done with it.It was too small for her to stay on, she kept getting stuck on the poles and she just outgrew it.So it did last us 5 months or so.We saved the bag it came in and it is put away and went back in nicely.I do wish we had gotten one that could have been used when she was able to sit.Some other gyms do have pieces that you can sit on the floor and your child can play with it from a sitting position.He like the song.(by that i mean shake his body around)  Definitely one of his favorite toys.Only problem is that he drooled on 2 of the legs too much that the buttons don't work.It was exactly what I thought it was going to be.It could be that my daughter is not old enough to enjoy this toy yet she is a little over 3 months, but my 5 year old loves to play with it.He keep asking if he had one when he was a baby.Overall the toy is cute and durable the songs are also catchy.Once she gets older I am sure it will keep her entertained as well.My daughter likes too slam the octoplush around causing it to make noise.Didint get a five because it wont keep her interest for too long but its long enough to get a four.This is a toy she continuously plays with.This little guy is great!He's easy for my 7 month old grand baby to handle and play with.He plays fun music and holds my little guy's attention.He is not plush material, he is a corser material, something else that I didn't realize when I ordered him.Yep.One foot quit working after a few months.The music is fun and not tiresome.My only complaint is that it tends to fall over because of the heavy soundbox.I don't know what it is, but every baby I know who has one of these adopts this as their go to security object.I'd be tempted to try to enumerate all the great things about this, but frankly, I have no idea why babies love these.It's soft, but I'm guessing there's more to it than that, and we'll just have to wait until somebody makes one of those speaking gadgets for babies that they had for the dogs in "Up" before we'll really know what the deal is.But I can say this: for the love of God get at least three.You'll need some in reserve, because eventually one will get barfed on or lost and you'll be really glad when your child's security object needs are still able to be met with nothing more than a quick little switcheroo.You may need to rotate in the second and third string blankies for a while to get them all smelling like you.That way, when the need truly strikes, the blankie you call in from the bullpen will not smell like the factory.He loves to cuddle soft things, and we didn't feel comfortable putting a stuffed animal in his crib.Cotton vs. Polyester:Polyester is produced entirely from chemical sources, a polymer produced from coal, air, water, and petroleum products.Cotton/polyester blend is commonly used for beddings.Although easier to care for, it takes away the 'coolness' from cotton and also added a "pilling" effect.Cotton fibers are harvested from seed pods of the cotton plant.Cotton fibers absorb and release perspiration quickly, thus allowing fabrics to "breathe".I would give this 5 stars just for its use as a pregnancy pillow.It was great because it is firm so it didn't sag and gave me the support I needed and wasn't so huge that it took up the whole bed.Then I opened it up and used it for my baby's tummy time and the short barrier kept the dog out so it stayed clean.We did that for about the first 2 months until he got too tall to fit.I didn't use it as a nursing pillow at first because it seemed too big and awkward, but I put it behind my back so I could sit up in bed to nurse.Now my baby is 4 months old and I just purchased a glider (should have done that 4 months ago) and I have rediscovered this pillow because it is big enough that my 16lb 4 month old can still lay on it to nurse while I rock him.oh, and another reviewer mentioned it is hard to clean, so I kept mine covered with 2 standard pillowcases.This is a terrific idea, but the elastic botton will not fit over the Back of my VW Routan.Wish the material was also a little thicker/sturdier than just a thin layer of polyester or cotton??My 10-month-old is still rear-facing in her car seat and she absolutely HATES it.However, since we can't turn her around to forward-facing yet my sister found this mirror for us in the hopes that it would stop our sweetie pie from screaming after 3 minutes in the car.THIS has done the trick!We've got the mirror stabilized on the safety latch behind the middle back seat in my Jeep Grand Cherokee.It's stable enough.And, the mirror height and tilt is adjustable.It's set up so that I can see my daughter AND she can see me waving at her.Most importantly, in the mirror she can see out of the windshield.She LOVES not looking at a back seat.I'm going to buy a second one of these for my husband's car.My sister's daughter is 2 months old and she loves staring at the toys on this.A nice big mirror and seems to work well for them.So far this seems to be a good buy.I have White Lether seats and this protector has kept the carseat from cutting and leaving indentions in my seat.I love the toy holder too.I wish I would have known about these sooner as we have another car with cloth seats that has been ruined by the carseats.I only wish they came in different colors to look better with my interior.I have been using this mat for a year, and the car seat on top of it leave no dent to the leather seat in my car.I have light color leather seats in both cars, and this mat does not discolor my seats.I notice some reviewers said the non-slip plastic at the bottom melted.I don't have this problem with my mat.This is a great product!It covers the whole area that the car seat touches the car (and I have a big car seat) and I am no longer concerned about my son's car seat damaging my car.I definitely recommend this for anyone with a car seat (forward or rear facing) who doesn't want any damage on their seats.It attaches by velcro to the back of your rearview mirror, which works out fine.But the problem is the mirror, it's not really a mirror at all but a mirror-like piece of paper.It literally gives me a headache to look at and it's hard to tell what's going on in the periphery.I'm going to buy a better product with a real mirror.These are a bit pricey for soft cars.But the soft body is an advantage when you have a car obessed child .Because they don't damage your furniture or hurt your feet when your kid drives over them.I hope that these are more durable than the previous plastic ones.I would recommend them to parents of children who loves cars.I bought the 4x8x4 osocozy diapers that should fit a baby till 30 pounds, my DD is a chubby 17 pounder at 5 months and has just about grown out these.They are very thick and absorbent.We started using these at about 3 weeks of age and they held in every BF poo she had, with or without a cover.These are great prefolds for a skinny baby or till about 6 months of age.It fits on to the Maxi Cosi very easily and quickly then stays put no matter how much wind is whipping around.I Put this over his carseat when we are out for a walk and it is really cold outside.This is the best convertible car seat ever!Very comfortable and extremely easy to set up...just follow the manual, which also is available on the company's website on PDF (for the tech pepople).We also bought a Britax and returned it because it did not recline and was very stiff and uncomfortable.This is forward and backward facing, reclines etc!The first time we opened the box and took out the carseat, our daughter sat in it after we removed the wrapping on the kitchen floor and refused to leave her "chair" that night, and fell asleep in it.We are back to the Maxi Cosi brand because Dorel makes the best products for babies and kids period.Excellent purchase, the only drawback is that the toddler seat does not snap into the quinny...kidding!However, after buying it and trying to install it for over 45 minutes - we walked back into the store and returned it.The directions are incomprehensible and the seat is impossible to install (rear facing at least - didn't attempt forward facing.)No excuse for that - with latch system it should be brain dead simple but for some reason its not with this model.We had the Chicco Keyfit infant seat and its so easy to to install so we were shocked when we could not get this one in correctly and could not decipher the cryptic directions.Happy with it after a few weeks of use.He hated his infant car seat.it was so small and he screamed every time we put him in it.Our car didn't allow this chair to be rear facing but he was already a year and 20Ibs so we were able to have him face forward.Some of the review said it was hard to install but we never had a problem.One bitter sweet thing on this car seat is when you tighten the strap it's very hard you have to put your knee on the seat and wrap the belt around your hand a few times to get it tight.I guess that's a good thing knowing that it's a tight lock but not good for a busy mom.We initially liked this carseat because it was not so bulky for our station wagon, but as our daughter grew (and she is on the smallish side for her age), we began to see the drawbacks to this carseat.The major complaint is that the lower buckle is not adjustable so as the child's torso & bottom grows, the buckle is fixed uncomfortably close to the crotch.This will NEVER do for our son and we are now shopping for two new convertible carseats that don't take up so much room in the backseat.However, the royal blue color of the eyes and especially the smiles was so bright that it almost gave the animals a frightening, or menacing look.If that doesn't bother you, the rug is otherwise cute.I bought most of this set locally but was able to get two of these rugs on Amazon for much less than the stores.It comes rolled up but flattens out very quickly.VERY SOFT!No matter how slowly I pull it, it still makes a very loud and deep click.It is very heavy and feels like it's made to last.Overall, great product and worth the cost.Our daughter who is over 25 lbs.can lean up against the middle of a section in this configuration and the structure will not budge.On its own it confines baby to a very small area - need to use the wall on one side and hope that the gate can be configured to fit the house architecture.The pictures are misleading as to how large the enclosed play area is - you have to use 2 such gates in some of the pictures.In fact, the picture showing two kids playing together, has 8-panels, so it includes an extension.My son looked like he was doing time enclosed in this gate.Also, at only 8 months, he could shake it so hard it was bound to collapse.And yes, it did scratch the hardwood floors.This gate and the sorry look of my kid confined in it trying to break out, convinced me for good that gates for babies are inhumane.I childproofed an entire room at first, and eventually the entire house, so the baby can roam around and explore.I only have gates at the top and bottom of the stairs, but that's it.I love this product in that it is very sturdy, extremely easy to set up, and it keeps my baby safe so that I can do all those things that a person has to do in order to remain sane and keep her house from falling down around her.I might as well toss Elsie in her crib with her toys to keep her safe.I recommend buying at least one set of extenders to make it an octagon or a square if you're going to use the play yard free-standing.We use this gate to close off a room with an 8 foot doorway (to keep babies out of the home office).12 feet of gate were provided and if we felt that it was not sturdy enough we would have arced the gate, rather than laying it out straight across.When we tried it out in the arced fashion, it was sturdy enough for an adult to go crashing into it and still stay standing.We used the hardware provided with the gate and had no issues.The gate can be detached from the wall in about 1 minute, so if we were interested in moving the gate somewhere and using it as a play yard elsewhere, that would be very easy.As long as you setup your gate in a non-straight formation, you probably don't need to attach the gate to the wall by screwing it into studs (you'll need your own hardware if you don't attach the gate to a wall stud or wood).However, you should give the gate a good test once you're setup.This gate is sooo much better than the others (better than the Kidco Configure Gate too)!I like that this fence gives you the option to be used as a self-supporting enclosed play yard OR wall mounted AND you don't have to buy anything else to have these options.Other gates don't come with wall mounts and these other gates with wall mounts cost more too.It is, however, very small if you just have the six-sided hexagonal starter kit.It took the playpen and made it a play-yard.Now it's big enough that I can get in and sit down with my daughter, and big enough to put more than one baby in at once.The original superyard was really only about as big as Elsie's crib, but with the two extra sides, it feels much, much bigger.I have mine set up as a square, two panels per side.I recommend the whole kit and caboodle.This toy is so cute and the fact that it's a pirate just makes my son love it all the more!A great toy for kids starting to get dressed and use buttons, snaps, zippers, and laces.It's much bigger than I thought it would be, which is definitely a plus for little fingers.I'd say it's probably about a foot tall from top to bottom.It's machine washable so whenever it's dropped in dirt or smudged, you can just throw it in the washer and it's good as new!Our daughter received this doll from Santa this year for Christmas, at 20 months.Her daddy helped her name the doll Princess Kate, and now she is a part of the family.Our daughter sleeps with her, and carries her all over the place.It is also a great toy for learning dressing tasks.I had a similar doll when I was young, though not as cute!Our daughter is already able to do several of the tasks - zipper, snap, button, and velcro.The shoe tying will come in time!This is such a cute little toy!The pirate is very cute and can be used to learn how to tie laces, etc.what a fun interactive toy.makes alot of noises just by grabbing the petals and the bug.vibrates when you pull apart the bug from the flower.Attached it onto mobile of my 4mo olds swing (fisher price zen)...now when he wakes up instead of crying to be picked up he stares up (the bottom of the toy has black/white contrast) and bats at the rings.He liked his swing for sleeping before, but that was about it.Now I can finish a few things while he entertains himself.I had tried another toy like this and he wasn't interested, as well as a high contrast picture but that only worked to have him look at something as he fell asleep- not for when he woke up.It is durable, makes a fun hum like sound when you pull the bottom part.She has three lamaze toys she likes them in the following rank order.I hook two on her car seat at all times, I swap the flutterbug out for Princess Sophie.I always leave the Firefly, it is her favorite, she gets upset if it is gone.She stopped crying in the carseat the first day we hung Freddie Firefly in there.Now she holds the rings and plays with him, or falls asleep holding those rings.(Granted if we take a very long car ride she will still cry - these got us about 30 minutes of silence/happiness on car trips)1.Freddie Firefly - by far her favorite2.The good features of this high chair are that it folds up easily, has a wipeable cushion, 5-point harness, recline (both the seat back and leg support) and adjustable height.Thus, when 'self feeding' starts, this becomes a problem because you have to clean the tray first to take it off before you can clean the baby (who, by this point is screaming to get down because he's done).This is a bad, bad, bad design:1.The tray does not slide on smoothly and often goes off-track when you are trying to side it in.3.The tray is poorly designed.There is an attached hard plastic piece that is designed to be straddled by baby's legs when it is in place.However, when the tray is slid in, it is easy to push the tray too far in and smoosh baby's crotch.Unpleasant.The same plastic piece prevents the tray from being set aside and laying flat somewhere for storage or just to set aside for a moment while putting baby in or out of the high chair.4.The chair is excessively HUGE.My 6 month old son is still too small to be buckled in snugly in this chair.I've seen a much better designed chair by Safety 1st.It is much easier to get baby in and out of the chair because of a much better tray and restraint design.We have 2 children & 2 Recaro car seats & 2 Recaro boosters.I replaced my Britax car seat for this one.Both of my children are very thin.These seats have great side protection unlike other seats I looked at.I read all the bib reviews and decided this was THE bib to get.I found it on sale at the baby superstore, and have not been disappointed in my purchase.If there are only a few little spills, I can just wipe it down with a wet rag.If it gets too dirty, I can wash it in the sink or throw it in the washing machine with his laundry, then air dry.I have also put it in the top rack of my dishwasher and it cleaned well, but the dishwasher was a little rough on it as it was wrinkled and stretched a bit after I took it out.Although it dried to retain its regular shape, I will use the washing machine instead.The only thing this bib doesn't work so well for is particularly runny foods/purees.When I first began feeding my son rice cereal and breastmilk, it would run down his chin and onto his clothing - the neck opening is wide enough to allow food to pass behind it.The same thing sometimes happens with applesauce or store-bought purees.Works great for my five month old who just started rice cereal.Bumkins makes great products!This product popped up when I searched for "superbib" and the picture looks like my Superbib.If you are looking for a superbib, do not buy this product.I am giving it 5 stars however, because Bumkin bibs are awesome and my gripe is with the labelling of this product.We also have the Dr. Seuss one.The bib is cute and it does it's job keeping my baby's clothing clean.I just run it under water and set it outside to dry.My baby is only 6 months old and I don't see this bib lasting much longer due to tightness of the neck.Awesome product...  now I can drink wine with dinner, and then test my breastmilk before baby drinks it.If it comes up colored on the tab, we just use previously frozen milk.I was finally able to use it for the first time this weekend (March 2010).I was a little scared given the nasty reviews I had read regarding the poor construction.To make it a 5-point harness (instead of a 3-point) a little finagling is required, and it's made a little more difficult if your child is squirmy like mine.We figured it out, though, and were on our way.It handles great!We walked down the street and back (traveling on sidewalk and street), and he was asleep by the time we got home (stoller must be comfortable if he's asleep!).Then we headed to the mall.The stroller collapses easily and I was able to stow it in the back seat floorboard (I drive a Saturn Vue).Took it out of the car, unfolded it, and it was ready to go quite quickly.I really like that you can see the top of your little one's head thru the canopy--which still hasn't budged or given us any trouble.Not sure where all the negative reviews are coming from...we love ours!As a result, they move around during the wash cycle and don't get clean.I picked up a set of these just to try them out because they were so inexpensive.I was so happy with them that I went to the store to buy another set and ended up buying two more sets (the only two the store had or I would have bought three!).They are great for so many things, not just baby stuff.It took a little experimenting to figure out how the closures worked.I cut the plastic bands to make them easier to free from the packaging.I don't know if it was because I used the right bottles + nipples or not.One little think though: I've purchased a set of nipples and one of them didn't have the hole perforated so my son was kinda of pissed as no milk was coming out of there.That's why I gave them 4 stars.Overall, very good product.I will recommend it!These nipples have worked great for my daughter going back and forth between breastfeeding and the bottle.I was sterilizing the nipples and bottles (boiling water) and the inner blue nipple melted in to a heap on one of mine, and the other got a large crack at the hole where the milk came out.I had to buy more.I still like this bottle overall, especially over the Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Set, which I feel like was an expensive waste of money.Just beware when using boiling to sterilize your stuff!I have been using Dr. Browns bottles since my baby was about 2 months.Our baby is a breastfed baby and he refuses bottles now.period.He used to use Tippee Tommee Bottles and then decided one day no more!We have tried EVERYTHING under the sun.I think he would have taken it earlier, after birth, if I had offered it to him sooner.OMG why don't they issue these at the hospital when you have your baby?!?!My daughter had no confusion between breast and bottle feedings!With the regular bottle nipples she did but I received the stage one with the breast pump I purchased and thought it wouldn't hurt to try and I'm glad I did!Our baby loves this bottle, and it makes it easy to switch from bottle to breast.I just wish they came with collars and caps.The bear is made out of the softest fabric ever.I use it while i'm not using her diaper table to change her.It's a great buy, and lets not mention the cute design!It's completely washable as well, i think the bear gets softer with every wash. :)I got this rug in pink for a baby present and we love it!It took so long to get around the circle at my baby shower because everyone wanted to hold on and snuggle up with it.I really didn't think we'd use it much but we leave it out in the living room with toys around for her to play on.Now at 6 months we still sit her on the bear mat to play but she somehow ends up rolling and scooting off.As all baby products should be - it's very easy to clean.Machine washable.It's seriously so soft.I've found myself napping on it several times while the baby plays nearby.This was a Christmas gift from my aunt for our eight and a half month old daughter.It wasn't something I ever thought of buying or thought I needed, but now that I have it I can't live without it!Although our daughter is sitting up, she still flops back or to the side at times; I was propping pillows next to her on the floor during playtime, but it is a pain to always drag the pillows to the play area and you can't just throw them in the washing machine when you are done.This mat is the perfect answer!You can throw it in the washing machine (cold water, gentle cycle) which is ideal for spit up/drooling babies.I uploaded a picture :)Purchased this based on the purchasers reviews, and the fact that it looks cute!I love the Sugar Booger mat.It is very thick and has a nice weight which helps it to stay in place.My little girl fell in love with it as soon as I got it out of the box.Also comes with a cute little storage envelope with a zipper for traveling.The mat is super cute and has a good weight so it doesn't move around much on its own.We have wood floors in our kitchen (I know, weird!), so we wanted this to protect the floors from our food-flinging toddler.The care instructions say you can wash it in a washing machine and hang to dry, but DON'T do it!The coating and the cloth backing have separated in places all over the mat, so the coating appears to be all bubbly, and it looks really cheap.The mat won't lay flat anymore, and has a tendency to curl along the edges.I was hoping this would be with us for years and we'd use it under a craft table down the road, but I doubt it will last that long.It's also not especially "jumbo."I'm potty training my daughter and we're going straight from pull-ups to underwear.Cold turkey.Yep.While containing messes, it doesn't absorb the mess like a pull-up so my daughter very much knows when she's soiled herself.The price is great, came quickly, and was more of a selection than the ones at the local stores.Thick enough to help with training, cleans up well, and my daughter likes them!I could not find them in-store at Wal-Mart or Target, so I was glad Amazon had them.My son likes the printed ones the best and can easily pull them down to sit on the potty and pull them up when he's done.I didn't want to use pullups because they are too much like a diaper, so I thought these were great since they have padding in case my son didn't make it to the toilet quick enough but he can still feel he had an accident.A potty training must!Since no training pants hold very much pee, I think these are just fine; and they are cute; and they are soft and fit well.They hold a very small amount of pee but that is why we got them.We don't want to use pull ups since they are just like diapers and my daughter loves to wear these.Great for potty training a toddler!The thick middle helps absord pee and (runny) poops instead of thinner undies that would leave the floors a mess.we used these training underwear for my daughter during potty training when she was three.The crotch area has a thicker cloth, so when she had an accident it soaked up a lot (but not all).I do wish it would have stopped all leakage, but I guess that's what the plastic training underwear is for...?I will buy this again for the next time.They feel wet when he pees in them and don't hold much, which has been great for him to understand that he can't just go in them as he can in a diaper.18 mo = 24-28 lbs or 30-32 in; 2T = 28-32 lbs or 32-34 in; 3T = 32-35 lbs or 34-38 in.Btw, did I mention that both mom and daughter love these panties?I had this mattress months before my baby arrived... looked great, chemical free, organic... loved it.Well, after only 3 months of my little guy sleeping on it, the mattress wasn't feeling or looking firm anymore.I even had to position my baby in different spots to try and find him a flat spot to sleep on.Unacceptable safety wise (and $$$ wise).So, I emailed Naturepedic and described what was occurring, and they set up to ship me a new mattress immediately!The mattress arrived within days, and it was much more firm than my previously purchased one was when it was new!Like many people on here, I wanted a quality organic mattress for my new baby.In researching, it seems that Naturepedic really knows what they are doing in this area.Their website explains how they have developed the mattress using quality materials and organic cotton.I like that they are made in the USA and have a decent warranty too.The mattress appears well made and our daughter seems to do fine with it.I just ordered another (although, not from Amazon, since the price was slightly lower elsewhere) one for our new son.Overall....highly recommended.I disagree with others that say the top is not flat.The top is perfectly flat.It is a firm mattress that has no odor at all, the top cover will protect the mattress from dust mites and liquids, and its made from high quality food grade plastic-  not cheap plastic that can leach off chemicals.People think all plastic is unsafe and this is simply NOT TRUE.They do make plastics that are safe and most food products we buy are stored in the cheaper stuff anyway.SO if you put a safe sheet on top this mattress to lesson the effect of the plastic cover you will have no problems with this mattress.Its great that you buy this and you don't have to spend extra money on a good cover, its already on the mattress.Organic cotton, etc.I don't agree with any of the bad reviews people gave this.I think its good people are awake to the fact there are dangerous products out there that are unsafe but I think they are being too picky and unfair on this mattress.It does not have a high spot in the middle as some said, and any mattress for a child needs to have a good cover.SOmetimes in life there is no perfect answer.You need to make a choice on what makes sense and find the safest product you can that will function.I don;t believe a mattress without a plastic cover is going to be safe for long.Soon you will have urine in it and it will end up harboring bacteria and whatever else.Then your safe mattress will be causing more harm then good.I think this for the money is as good as you will get and delivers on everything I was looking for."...simply the healthiest crib mattress available"?There are WAY healthier mattresses.You can buy mattresses now that are made of organic rubber cores, unoiled metal springs, and organic cotton and wool (wool being flame retardant, dust mite protective, and waterproof without the plastic addition).Europe even sells crib mattresses made of organic coconut fibers.And most of these are cheaper than Naturepedic's mattress.Besides, who wants their baby sleeping on chemical-laden plastic?Polyethelene is made of petroleum, and the production of this promotes pollution.Save your money and buy a "real" organic mattress for less money.I know some people think putting your kid in a harness is treating your kid like a dog but I'm not one of those people.This little guys is really cute.Now the few times we've had to use this she hasn't given us any issue.I have a fractured spine so having to chase a toddler in a busy area is difficult if not impossible at times.At first, my toddler hated this and would go to the end of the rope and throw herself on the ground.But I perseviered and now she tolerates it pretty well.Once she realizes it is not going to come off, she stays with me well, and likes how cute it is.She also uses it as a lovey in the car.The straps are comfy and not restrictive, and I like that the leash can connect to the side or the back.(We usually use the side.)I would definitely recommend, but unless you use it from the beginning, be prepared to work with your toddler.We got so many compliments with this little guy on the back of our little guy walking through the city streets!If you have small hands/wrists, the safety loop may easily slip off, which can be concerning since this harness is meant to keep your child "connected" to you.It allows your child to be hands-free to explore or hold his/her cup or toys while being connected to you.Design improvements could be an adjustable leash length and wrist loop.Stuff does fall out of it though, so do make sure you also buy the cover lid for it, so you do not have snacks all over in your bag like I ended up having.Got the cover lids now and I can truly recommend the snack traps.We love our Chicco KeyFIt30 car seat.It is a little heavier than my previous Graco car seats, but well worth it.For us, having an base in both cars is a necessity.Really helpful if you have other kids or you are in a hurry.We purchased this base so that we could easily move the our KeyFit22 between two cars.I love this sling.I wish I had know about this product when my baby was first born.Would have save my arms and wrist.It would have been so useful for those first baby months.I'm barely 2 and the x-smal didn't feel comfortable if you are carrying a baby.Also it is very complicated to use, you really need to take a tutorial.In my opinion is expensive, difficult to use and wrong sized.My little guy loves being in the baby k'tan.He will happily hang out while I clean or write emails etc.And when he gets fussy we pull out the k'tan and it instantly soothes him.This is one of the best baby purchases!I tried the Moby first but couldn't deal with the 12 feet of fabric and all the time it took to just get it on me.Especially when he is fussy that extra time really makes a difference.The k'tan is so easy to throw on quickly and get baby in and happy asap.Love it and so does baby (he's sound asleep in it as I write this review!)Granted it's a bit of work to break down.Once we get the hang of it it's no problem.We have not used it as a play yard yet.We have advised all of our friends to buy this item when co-sleeping!I can't even begin to tell you what a life saver these are.Then we introduced food.And the poo, it changes.A lot.And it smells.This means our diaper pail smells.Bad.Enter Kushies!It makes clean up a snap (I'm sure it would be the same for disposable since you are still supposed to remove before you throw out).Bonus, our pail doesn't smell half as bad as before (this is a huge deal too).So if you use cloth, you owe it to yourself to get these.I usually flush them with the rest of the "mess" and don't feel guilty, since they're biodegradable.Makes cloth diapering much more tolerable since I don't have to touch or rinse poo off of diapers before tossing them in the pail.I use cloth because I want something soft next to my baby's bottom, and these are not soft at all.The hold up well, although I have not tried washing them like some say you can.They tend to bunch up on my crawler, so sometimes aren't effective.Honestly, we only got through half a roll before I got frustrated with them... Liners aren't really necessary anyway.Oh, and don't flush these, they will clog up your septic tank.All in all, I wouldn't recommend these.Not bad.They last forever.I like these liners.Great idea and people are impressed when I explain the concept to them.I have found that they tend to bunch up.I have tried to wash the wet liners to reuse another day but have yet to get one to make it out in decent shape.I don't use them in every diaper though so one roll lasts for a while.It does indeed make poop removal easier, although it is a bit narrow.I would never want my child to sit in dried out paper so that my job is easier.I thought these would be the salvation for cloth diapering, but they're just not what I was expecting.My baby is breastfed, so his stool is still very loose and VERY yellow, so it just kinda goes through these liners.I have, however, washed them a few times on accident and they actually come out of the dryer looking brand new like they could be reused.Turn off power at the breaker, remove old outlet cover screws, pop out 1 or 2 holes depending on outlet type, fit using new screws.Took me at *most* 3 minutes for the first one, but only a minute for the last one.I'm not a big fan of outlets which only have the single screw because - as naturally happens - it makes any outlet cover more likely to move.But that's not a fault of the product.The only flaw with the product happens when you are required to have a single-screw outlet cover and only a 2-prong plug: the sliding part may dislodge the plug.But this is just as much the fault of whoever designed outlets like this and the apparent American default of non-grounded items which leave insecure plugs easy for anyone to knock out.This product is awesome, yes it takes a little time, one time to remove the old outlet covers and replace with this new one, I would say it took my husband about 2 hours to replace about 36 outlet covers in the house.I like this child safety cover for ever reasons, one is the outlets look like outlets no one would know unless they really looked, second the old plastic child push in 100 to a box child safety plug ins a child can choke on, and it a royal pain when you need to use the outlet.Plastic keys are a classic toy, and one that I like to get for all my pregnant friends.I was disappointed in these ones though, especially for $2.99 (I see them in stores sometimes for $0.99)  The plastic is not as high-quality as ones from my youth, and there are fewer keys per chain now too.Even for today's standards, I have seen better-quality keys for cheaper price.It's such a simple toy, but my daughter ADORES her keys!For under $2 a pop it's totally worth it to get a few extra sets to keep in the playpen, car, diaper bag, etc to make sure you always have some handy.All the things a child loves.My daughter likes the fact that she is like mommy and daddy with her on set of keys.great product.He grabs it from me every time I show it to him.Purchased this for my granddaughter who is a tall toddler (3 ft) with cerebral palsy.This sat firmly on top of the existing toilet seat and is built sturdily.In fact, my granddaughter's chosen position on the potty is cross legged lol!Kiddyloo Toilet Seat ReducerSeveral mealtimes of requests for a 'big' chair halfway through resulted in either her tears at refusal or me getting out another chair for myself or taking the booster off of her chair.Our chairs are upholstered so I bought a her a 'special' chair (of the $15 Ikea variety) and slapped Kaboost on the bottom.There's no switching chairs, cleaning crumbs out of the booster, worrying about the upholstery or having a chair always taken up by the booster.So the stepstool tucks in really nicely and we just leave it right there at the base of her chair.This is a well constructed device and may serve some kids very well.There are two height settings on this chair booster, but even the lowest setting was too high for us.Unfortunately, when Grandpa tried it he clipped a bit of the surrounding skin and the baby (at about 15 months) responded with a lot of crying.It works very well,and the little magnifying lens is an aid, if we can keep the baby still.Plus, we're trying to be more careful.Gary PetersonI purchased these thinking that the magnifying glass would help.I agree with other reviewers that the magnifier on these clippers is virtually useless.After that I was reluctant to use these clippers, but a couple weeks later I tried again WITHOUT the magnifier and was much more successful (while baby was sleeping, of course).Because of this, I would recommend just buying simple, normal baby clippers and forget the magnifier.We've tried 3 or 4 different infant nail clippers.This one has its pros & cons.I was excited about the magnifying glass, but it doesn't help.The best infant clippers, in my opinion, have a guard to prevent cutting too much.The biggest design flaw in this is that the pin keeps falling out - and it almost impossible to get back in (I've had to do this twice).If you own (or are buying) these clippers, do yourself a HUGE favor - put a dab of superglue or even clear nail polish on both sides of the pin (at the head of the clippers).Don't bother looking - you just have to bite off the nails with your teeth.But you have to read the instructions (or watch a Youtube on how to use them) - most people who have reported problems just haven't read the instructions.The best clippers we found have a guard (like the Sure-Grip), but are a no-name brand we found at a church rummage sale.Hope this information helps.Good luck!Magnifier is kind of a waste, but I have good vision.This is the first teething product that our son will use.I think it is because he gets a positive response when he bites down, while everything else is just another something that can be stuck in the mouth (and because we WANT him to stick teethers in his mouth instead of, for example, small plastic pieces from age inappropriate toys or daddy's shoulder, he refuses).It is nice to see that there are other vibrating teethers on the market, and we may buy another although the star shape seems to be pretty effective.I should mention that we did NOT buy this from Amazon, we got it from a supermarket, but it is nearly identical (the color of the completely pointless spinning part at the bottom is different).I am leaving this review because I just left negative reviews for two other teethers that I did purchase from Amazon and I recommended this product instead.A teething baby is an unhappy baby.An unhappy usually makes for tired parents who are searching for answers.While the "The First Year Massaging Action Teether" does not solve the problem it does see to offer our daughter a little relief.The pros-- Inexpensive - really, how much do you stand to lose if this does not work?- Our daughter seems to enjoy the massaging action, although she rarely uses it for more than a minute.- The massaging section is shaped so that it can be "bitten" in a variety of directions.Once the batteries die the whole thing goes into the garbage.While this seems to be a negative - I really don't mind that my daughter mouth does NOT have any type of access to batteris.Call me old-fashioned like that ;o)Final Verdict - I would not consider this a "must-have" but for the price it is well worth the investment of a few dollars.4 starswe start using this from when he was 4mo.He was throwing up while he was biting it so I only gave him after his stomach was settle down.now and he still enjoy this teether.I recommend this to everyone.I recieved three bottle brushes for my baby shower.My girlfriend (whose daughter was a few months older than my son) noticed I was using a different brush and asked why I didn't use this one.She said she wanted one like it and that the one I had would fall apart soon.I'll probably swop it out only to have a new/clean one soon.The sponge hasn't fallen off or fell apart like the other ones and the top sponge cleans that area near the top of the bottle where dried milk lieks to collect very well.I use Dr. Brown bottles which have a bunch of little parts to clean.The sponge has a tendency to slide around which is annoying, but not a dealbreaker.However, after using it for about a month (daily scrubbing of 6 bottles plus bottle paraphernalia) I noticed rust on the inner wire structure between the blue sponge and the handle.Then one day, while scrubbing away, the brush snapped off completely from the handle exposing a rusty wire.I thought at first we had been too rough with it, but the inner wire structure on a product like this should never rust.I guess it's pretty typical for these to break after several months of usage.This did the job for 5 months and then the handle broke off... oh well, it was getting dirty and needed to be changed anyway.I keep on buying these bottle brushes because they clean our baby's bottles well and they are cheap, but they are not very durable.The handle plastic ends up breaking after about a month or two of use.Then I have to buy a new one.I like the foam cleaner part and the nipple bush in the handle--both are great for cleaning our bottles.I do like the size of these and I can put them in the freeze and dishwasher with no issues.I would recommend these.There is a fill line and I never fill beyond that point.I really like the fact that I can easily feed baby out of the cubes.I don't have to transfer to another bowl and they are easy to pack in the diaper bag.The only thing I am not sure about is if they are BPA free.That is one of the major reasons I ordered them.I did a search on amazon for BPA free and this came up but the packaging does not even mention it.However, after only a few uses a little bit of plastic broke off (who knows where it is) and that's almost scarier than BPA or pthalates.We're sticking with silicone.Just going down to one star.I took the tray out of the freezer (7 mo.baby in one arm) and one of the jars fell on the floor.But now I'm going to throw them all away.That was really scary.Kinderville all the way.This product has a nice portion size, but I prefer Beaba much better although it is more expensive.Removing the babyfood from the cubes leave waste behind.It's much cheapter at Babies R Us.I baked up a sweet potato, mashed it, added water so it was thin and smooth, and placed about 1 ounce in each cup and froze them.It is so easy to just grab a cube and throw it in the bag for later eating.They thaw enough to eat in an hour to an hour and a half (at room temp).If I am using one at home, I place the cube in shallow hot water to defrost or you can run it under hot water to loosen it and microwave it in a glass bowl.I will be buying some of these for friends having babies.I've found a contianer that I like alot better (but they are 4 oz).You may want to check out Sure Lid containers.No problems with them so far...Sure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * 4 Ounce/Half Cup/118mL - 2 Per PackI bought this because my daughter has reflux and spits up and this was the best tool for mixing out all of the clumps in the Similac RS formula.It worked great for a month, however now the button on the top stopped working; even after replacing the batteries.Kind of bummed out.I guess I'll try the Prince Lionheart brand one or look for latte frother.But it was a waste of money.The battery connectors dont work well so either its hard to turn the thing on...or impossible to turn it off.sometimes when it's just sitting there in the cupboard it will have a spasm and turn on and off by itself.My daughter is 10 months and I bought these a couple months ago when she was able to sit on her own.Well...to be honest this is the crappiest water toy.Only the biggest cup holds enough water to actually drain, the other cups are useless.She loved them.As she got older I took them to the sandbox with her.She loved them.Then we took them into the kitchen for water play in the sink while Mommy cooked.She loved them.Now she used them to pretend they are measuring cups in her own kitchen and sometimes she pretends to juggle them with her Dad.They still look brand new and have provided hours of entertainment for her.Great toy that has lasted the longest in terms of entertainment and physicality of all our toys to date.The tongs are very small and I would say useless.But the rest is good.I don't find this product useful.I'd rather just boil a large pot of water and save myself the time and hassle over using this product.Would not buy this again.I use Clorox Spray anywhere, just spray it on 1 foam tile at a time and wipe dry with a paper towel.The tiles have lots of wear as well.Not only do these protect the floors, they keep my girls from sliding all over(they go crazy in those things) and it also keeps their feet warmer from the bare floor.We've had their jumperoos on these foam mats for well over a year and they don't have indentations or any wear what so ever!We've used these while doing home improvement projects to protect our knees/backs, they work great, especially if you double them black side up...MUCH better than knee pads!!We just recently put a piece of exercise equipment in the living room(one of those crazy Gazelle things you see Tony Little doing on infomercials) I got it from my parents and figured I might actually work out if I can watch TV as I do it so we put 4 of these mats down and voila!My husband had to dissasemble the machine a few days ago and there were no signs of wear or indentations.Anytime we have something that might damage the floor we get out these mats and they do a perfect job.Both of them have their own beds & both of them are allowed on all of our furniture but they end up laying on these mats all the time.It's funny when our English Bulldog(who we'll just say he likes to eat) he will try to fit himself on a little edge that is sticking out from their jumperoos with most of his body hanging off ; )The list of uses for these mats are endless...These are SO durable.If I were to throw a Twinkie, my Gazelle & these mats in the trash and they went to a landfill, I think in 100 Million years you would find a cockroach working out on the Gazelle that is sitting on these mats.I know what you're thinking "why is the cockroach working out?"Because he ate the Twinkie, of course ; )However, the quality of this tote is poor.The side walls are thin, the strap seems cheap, and the ice pack broke open after only a few weeks use.I ended up buying a different cooler tote in the lunch bag section at Target (for a few dollars less), and it is of much higher quality.I would recommend exhausting all other options before buying this bagwas disappointed to find that this is quite heavy and actually contributes to the pacifier falling out of my baby's mouth.would definitely not buy again.the only reason i gave it 2 stars is for the cute design.I am very happy with this car seat.I did alot of research before i purchased this and think it is a good value for the money.The base is easy to install, and the car seat snaps in and out easily.Once the base is installed, it's very simple to pop the seat in and out of your car.That way, we can easily switch cars without having to install the base every single time.It took us a total of maybe 30 minutes to set up and install everything.The base makes getting baby in and out of the car very easy and convenient, but even without it, the seat is still remarkable.I love how easy it is to just "snap" right onto our Literider stroller straight from the car.)1) The fabric/padding is a little thin.It's not terrible, and our baby doesn't seem to mind.The thin fabric/padding may be more of an issue if you have a smaller newborn or preemie, and in that case maybe a infant support pillow would be an option for a little while.2) The head support is a little too big for newborns, but within a month or so our babies were big enough to use the support that comes with the seat.You really can't go wrong with the Snugride.We installed it in the car easily, and it's simple to transfer from car to stroller to swing.The product has lived up to their reviews and our expectations.Quality construction, secure fit in our crib, and the firmness that babies require.We went with the foam mattress due to the overall weight.Changing crib sheets is difficult and the foam mattress at least cuts down on the weight one has to lift and move in order to do so.I was excited when I put the mattress in my crib (which takes a standard sized mattress) and had to push on it a little to get it down all the way- NO SPACES in the sides or corners!It is also vented in the sides which gave me more peace of mind when thinking of how hot foam can get and the issues some foam mattresses can have with bacteria and such- that shouldn't be a problem with this mattress as it has a waterproof cover and is vented.The mattress is also extremely light, I handled it in the box easily at 6 months pregnant.I bought it because it was the top baby bargains recommendation, and am extremely glad I spent the extra money on a great mattress!yes, crib mattresses are supposed to be firm, but even the soft side of this one is still quite firm if you ask me, never even used the infant side.We love the three-sided contoured edges, and the size fit our delta changing table with no problems.The straps are a big plus also, though our table also has straps, so we will probably end up using those.We were glad to see that a regular cover would fit this pad.The pad is soft and comfortable, and had no smell when we removed it from the packaging.We are going to purchase a second one for use downstairs.I definitely recommend this product.ps.shipped quickly too!I ordered this based on these reviews here and because it was $7 less than Babies R Us for a similar eco friendly changing pad.This pad didn't have the same paper insert listing all of the organic/eco friendly assets that the changing pad has or the same print on the pad as the Babies R Us pad did, but this pad didn't smell like plastic when it came out of the package so I didn't have a problem using it for my daughter.I am not an everything must be organic type of mom, but I just wanted a pad that was well made, and didn't reek like chemicals.It seems to be very well made, and worst case scenario if something happens to it within the first year of ownership it's guaranteed for one year!Another plus was that is Made in the USA.The wood is smooth and has a little bit of "grab" to it which I think he likes on his gums.We would buy again and we definitely recommend it to our friends who are about to have a baby.Plus - it is wood, not plastic and not chemical filled.Great for quick trips... my baby likes to have room to move around, but the car seat attachment is wonderful when he is asleep or we're doing a quick errand.And it works well with the second seat for my toddler.This is a must-have for any Uppababy Vista stroller owners, in my opinion.Works seamlessly with the Graco car seat and is super easy to install and uninstall.Additionally, if you have tinted windows the shade makes it somewhat difficult to see through.I have used a few different shades and none of them provided 100% protection.It always seemed that the sun could get through the corners.The shade fits the entire window in my SUV.It's sheer enough that my daughter can still see what is going on outside but has UV protection from the sun.We are very happy with this product and I would definitely recommend it especially for cars with large windows.I don't know why other shade manufacturers haven't caught on to this, but Uppa is the only shade I have found that even comes close to covering our windows.Thanks to the stretchy material, my daughter gets much better protection from the sun!The corner knobs and suction cups tend to come undone from time to time, but you have to make sure you're attaching them just right.We bought 6 of these - 2 for my car, 2 for my husband's, and 2 for my mom's, and we all couldn't be more pleased.My husband, father and I have all tried to get this thing to stick to my car windows and it just would not stay in place.We tried on days when there were different weather conditions and temperatures thinking that maybe it wasn't sticking due to dry air or colder temperatures.Guess what, on warmer more humid days it also didn't work!We tried using water, we tried spit and we tried sticking it on dry.Again, none of these attempts worked either.Only a few of the suction cups seemed to stick.The rest all ended up coming detached from the window and swinging around within minutes.It was very concerning to us from a safety perspective, so we finally just took it down and tossed it in the trash.We would not want someone else to buy this product and endanger their child - that's also why I'm taking the time to write this review!I have it hanging on a long cord above my baby's changing table so that it's about 2-3 feet above her reach.SInce she was 2 months old she has been enthralled with watching it.The two arms can rotate in opposite directions while also going up and down.A quick spin from me is all it needs to get her watching.SHe can reach for it while moving and immediately grasp what she is reaching for.They do not leak at all.Also, my baby is breastfed and has no problem with any nipple confusion with these bottles.I intended to use BornFree bottles exclusively, but little  did I know that my baby would not be a fan.He prefers the Dr. Brown bottles because the smaller nipple is easier to fit in his mouth.Also, I use a Medela pump, and the 4 oz Medela bottles always tip over in this sterilizer.I'm not sure it will be better with a different sterilizer though.The price on this one is quite high.)it does have that small nipple to suddenly a very wide bottle problem.. i switched to breastflow and that worked better for my kid.It's hard for me to say...this was the only bottle some of our nursing only kids would take for a date night, but they were kinda pricey for their lasting value.We did wash them in the dishwasher and I think this contributed to their eventually leaking [out the bottom].I'm torn between buying more.So, you end up buying several of several sizes.Expensive, but it is very much like a breast.It DOES have a bit of a learning curve like the Breastflow.For instance, one day I left my son with hubby to do some quick grocery shopping, but had to come home to show him that he had to put the bottle *upside down and into the cap in order to fill the bottle!!We ended up being given the Nuk from my mom and had IMMEDIATE success with it, JUST in then nick of time for our weaning him from the breast.We tried MANY baby bottles and this is the only one that our newborn latched to without any problems!The bottle is shaped like mommy's breast and the material used for the bottle nipple is soft against the baby's lips and face.The clear cover that goes over the bottle keeps it clean.Our baby had no problems transitioning from the breast to this bottle and back again.The bottles are also BPA free.We also snap on the caps for traveling.The added bonus is that they also look "cool" - the bottle design always prompts positive comments whenever we feed our baby at restaurants....Overall, we are very pleased with this nurser and would recommend this to anyone!Using the clock and a lot of firm, repetitive behavior will do it, but not over night.On another note, I wish the clock had multiple alarm settings.If you want to use it for nap time and night time, you have to manually change the alarm each time.We just started turning the sleeping bunny "on" for nap and then I would manually turn it off when nap time was over.It got to be way too much hassle to reset the alarm every day.Oh, and the actual alarm is very weird.Yes, it is a tad bit wobbly, and mine came with a scratch on the bottom of one of the sides.I didn't buy it because I wanted an expensive table.How long do you really use these things anyway?I figure I'll use it until the baby is walking, and then I will change him/her on the floor.Once they are mobile they don't necessarily want to be up on a changing table where they can't do anything but lie there anyway.It's very attractive (I got the cherry) and it matches the crib.I feel it's sturdy enough for me since I plan to be standing right beside it the entire time my baby is on it.I'm 5'11 and my husband is 6'2 and we both feel this table is at a very convenient height for both of us.If you're not obsessed with big, expensive, brand name baby furniture this might be the changer for you.If you are interested in a high-quality piece of furniture with a steeper price tag and are not interested in lowering your expectations, this table is probably not for you.Update:We have been using this table for 10 months and it has not fallen apart yet.It holds a full-time stash of cloth diapers, a full-time stash of disposables, cloth wipes, and a basket full of supplies like swabs and creams.It's plenty roomy.so we have 7 more lbs.to go before the weight limit is reached.Not sure we will make it that long, but it will definitely be around until then and would last through at least one more kid.and buying a cheap one at that.This proved to be one of the wiser choices about baby gear.It is a very pretty crib.I would have given it a 5 except it came in slightly damaged and I don't like that they don't have something white to cover the screws.They stick out like a sore thumb.I was disappointed that it had 3 dents on it.One was on the back so it didn't matter.Probably  won't be noticed by others but I do feel it was poorly packaged and certainly I would have been happier with it had it not had been damaged.I was very hesitant to buy a crib made from Graco because I think anyone knows Graco does not make cribs-  so the question is where they came from and who made it?I was worried Storkcraft made it which their cribs have caused babies to die and they are notorious for terrible customer service.Our last crib was made by them, got it at Toys R US and it was a cheap piece of junk.Well to be more accurate its not that the customer service is bad-  its simply NON EXISTENT!They will not return phone calls or emails and the thing broke way too easy.Anyway back this Graco.It is furniture quality as far as the wood, it feels solid and well put together, and VERY sturdy-  everything I wanted in out next crib.We put it together last night, wasn't to bad to do, there were no missing or bad fitting parts, and I am impressed at the strong parts and hardware.No way do I ever think anything on this crib could come apart or break and cause harm to our baby.After its all together it has a very sold feel, it will not shake around easily like other cheap cribs.The box was heavy which I thought was great, the heavier the wood the better built it is.If I thought otherwise it would have been shipped back.Its not just a plain crib, the top has a design and the bottom has a curve to it.Bottom line is for the price I think this is at the top of the list and we looked for months at cribs.I'm glad I gave the other one away and got this one for the new baby.I think Graco did a great job on this crib so when it comes time to finish up the room I am going to throw more business their way.Hopefully if there ever is a issue the customer service is good also, but I bet there is no way its worse then Storkcraft.Never, ever buy from them.Their products have killed babies and they do not care-  they still continue to make cheap junk.They should not be allowed to make cribs.Couple things to keep in mind:- if you want to have a dust ruffle it needs to be long as the bottom decorative piece is low to the ground so it blocks 80% of the material unless its long enough to reach the floor.- I havent been around a lot of cribs but it seems the mattress frame is low - even at the heighest setting.as is clearly stated this is not a drop side crib so you really have to reach over the rail and down in to the crib to reach the mattress.I'm a small mom (5') so maybe this is more of an issue for me than others.We put it together pretty easily.I made a stupid boo boo putting it together I used a wrong set of bolts in one place and had to take 3 parts apart again to fix the problem.Oh well that was my fault otherwise the assembly was easy and took less than 2 hours-with my error.The basket in my new stroller is a little smaller than my old, cumbersome stroller.You can buy two of these and put them on the sides of your stroller; I have only one so far but plan to do that for my lightweight stroller that doesn't have much of a basket.My 17 month old son knows his snacks are in there and reaches over to the side when he wants to indicate he'd like a snack.For better or worse.What a waste of money.The velcro attachment on the back ripped off after only 2 uses.I also found that it's not the best idea for a side-by-side stroller since they barely fit through doorways the way it is.I might try the skip hop version for my Quest.It's hard to make a one-size-fits-all product and it is well-constructed.Mine arrived with an upside-down logo for which the company gave me a small rebate, so I'm please with their customer service.For now, I'm hanging onto it until I can either find a use for it or until we no longer need a stroller, whichever comes first.I need to emphasize that you need to have a belly before you think about buying a pillow because you will better understand the difficulty of your sleeping habits.With that said, you need to figure out what kind of sleeper you are to properly find a sleep-aid pillow.If you still toss and turn, you need a lightweight body pillow (using a number of small pillows won't be any good for you because you will have to keep re-adjusting them and you need to stay as asleep as possible to maintain good sleep).Do you sleep with your legs straight or curved?This body pillow is for those of you who don't want to spend the whole night in one position (it is easy to throw on the other side and turn over on top of because it is lightweight) with your legs curved.If you like to sleep with your legs out straight, you will need another small pillow at the bottom.It's very plush and soft, so don't worry about the pillow being too stiff (unless that is what you are looking for).I've had a hard time sleeping with it during the summer time because my left arm is underneath the pillow and gets a little hot--but I'm sure that's a goofy problem and doesn't hurt my rating of the pillow.If you are one of those people who can spend a night not moving at all, but sleeping in one position, I would strongly recommend getting a number of small pillows.While this one is very comfortable, you have to sleep somewhat curled up, and if you need to stretch its a little difficult.It's hard to get comfortable trying to sleep during pregnancy.I like how the bottom can be bent to rest between my feet, knees, thighs, or wherever I need support.I also sleep with my back to the pillow and pull the lower part between my legs for support.The only negative I see with this pillow is the only color I could find it in was a green print, which doesn't go with the rest of my bedding.This pillow is great for the start of the pregnancy but by 5 mos, as my belly grew, i soon realized what other reviewers meant by no belly support.i wanted to return the pillow for another one with more belly support but missed the return date.i will definitely use it for the start of my next pregnancy, but for now, i need another one that will pick up where this pillow left off.I was so excited to see these- my dd has been standing for a month now and her regular sacks drive her crazy, not to mention the bruises she has from falling while trying to stand in them.I bought the 12-18 month thinking that since she was wearing 12 month clothing this would work fine.WRONG- its enourmous.I'm not sure when, if ever, she'll wear it.It took my husband and myself less than 30 minutes to put it together.There are a couple of things I want to point out - yes the wood does scratch easily.It is pine.Unless you want to spend $500 or more on a hardwood bed this is just a fact of life.Also the screw holes show in the front, but the tiny wood stoppers that usually cover something like this up would be a choking hazard.We have not put the trundle drawer together.We bought this crib because Davinci products don't show up on the re-call lists.They make good products, and this crib is no exception.It took us about an hour and half to assemble the crib and drawer.Other reviewers have commented on the instructions being too vague, but we found them to be sufficient.This crib is worth the money, especially with Amazon's low price and free shipping (I couldn't find a better price anywhere else).It was alot to put together.The instructions weren't the best but they also weren't the worst.I am a lil upset that its not made stronger.The wood is extremely light.I feel that it could easily break.Once put together its ok.When spending $[...] I expect it to be made of harder wood.If you are shorter than 5' good luck reaching over the side to pick up your child.It's a great purchase for the money and I'll probably buy another one for our second baby, since our son will still be using it as a toddler bed.Now that I'm pregnant again, I appreciate the dip in the front rail that allows me to get him in and out more easily!Two reasons for not giving it a five star rating: (1) the bolts that hold the crib rails together are exposed, which is only a cosmetic issue but doesn't look as neat as something with matching wooden plugs but it's so that you can take it apart easily when transforming, so I get it and (2) the trundle drawer is small and flimsy (particle board mostly).The drawer doesn't effect the crib at all but if it's part of the package, it gets considered when rating too.Overall, despite these two issues, I would buy it again and recommend it to anyone!I was so excited about this cup in principle- no chemicals, easy grip, cute.Within minutes it had become an epic disaster.First of all, the plastic looks and feels cheap.It's not flexible, but it's not as hard as the standard playtex sippy cups... it was just hard enough to be unpleasant and difficult to use.The top was almost impossible to get off, and unless you took a long time to carefully set it down and then took care not to breathe on it, it wouldn't stand up on its own.But the true fatal error of this cup is that it leaks abominably.I'm not talking about a couple little drops, either: it was practically pouring out.Now if this had been a one dollar sippy purchased at Walmart, I would think I'd gotten what I'd paid for, but for the asking price, I just about expect it to sing to me.No good, Boon.No good.We love the Boon products for our grandson but after reading the reviews for this cup, I was wary of buying it.After trying several others that got rave reviews and my grandson hated them all, I gave in and bought one - am I glad I did!I immediately bought 3 more!I think he likes it better than the rest because the spout is not soft so he doesn't try sucking on it like a bottle nipple - the liquid slot opening is just the right size so he gets the right amount of fluid w/o choking.Boon has done it again, great products that don't disappoint!This is not spill proof!That's why its a toddler cup and not a training cup.I don't know why people get so frustrated that it "leaks."She is 9 months old and this is our at home cup for now since its not spill proof.She thinks its a great cup and it keeps her busy when I'm cleaning up from her meal.I love this cup because it is easy to clean, has TWO parts and not 5 or 6 things to go missing like some cups and its made by Boon so I know its BPA free and safe to use.:)I've never had issues getting the top on or off and it stays on nicely.I really didn't think I'd like this cup after some of the reviews but for the price, give it a try.This cup got me with its cool looks and because we have a few other Boon products that we like.However it is very hard to get liquid to come out of the tiny opening.Besides this I find that it is hard to clean even with a bottle brush--we only put water in it but I can't imagine trying to get it thoroughly clean in the bottom area, for instance if you put some milk in it that then was "lost" under the couch or something...So it has mostly sat in the cupboard as an occasional back-up that becomes more of a toy.At 11 months our son is using the Thermos straw cups, they don't leak and keep drinks cold.As far as sippy cups go, the best ever I have used is called the "Tilty" cup, which is what we always use at the table during meals.With some thanks to the Tilty sippy my son can now drink out of a regular cup very well and without mess, unless he decides to tip it all the way up and over his head ;)In fact, we own three of these (one of each color).What I love about them is that they do not use one of those annoying valves in their attempt to be "No-spill".When my daughter (14 months) sucks on it she's able to drink normally, but when she carries it upside down, only intermittent individual drips fall out (as opposed to an entire stream of milk or water).This is a major plus in our household because we've spent 6+ months learning that NO sippy cup is 100% spill-free.We did have issues with one of the tops we purchased [no one could drink out of it, no matter how hard we (toddler and parents) sucked], but after a quick call to Boon Customer Service, we received a replacement top in the mail 3-4 days later which has been working perfectly.It is difficult to clean, difficult to use and difficult for my child to get anything out of it.After one use, it went in the trash.I read all the reviews on the Boon Spoon and had to buy it for my baby!In fact, I bought two, because I got a good price at the grocery store, then bought another at a consignment sale.Well, the lumps in the food clog in the hole and cause a back-up.I suppose if you strained the homemade food through a mesh strainer, it would work.This product is very easy and fun to use.Works as promised and it is easy to clean.This is the best invention ever!We love the Boon Squirt Spoon!I have 3 kids, and this has made #3 so much easier at feeding time.I just fill the spoon, close it tight & feed.Most of the time he doesn't even get his bib dirty because it's completely mess-free.I recommend it to other moms every chance I get :)My son immediately tore the lid off the ball, then he shook it and threw it around, sending snacks flying everywhere, then he figured out how to unscrew the ball part and it was in two pieces.The Boon Snack Ball was entertaining for him but totally useless for snacks.Choosing design over function makes me feel like a yuppie idiot.(See my review of the horrid Keekaroo wood highchair).Lessons learned, I'm sticking with dorky uncool designs that actually work and make my SAHM life easier not harder!The number one problem is the round shape.While it looks cool, it has no flat part at all to it so if you set it down anywhere, it rolls.Set it on a table and it rolls and falls on the floor.That makes it really impractical and you're out and about.Third, I think its use is mainly limited to transporting/storing the snack, not really to eat out of.The opening is big enough to pour but little hands can't really get in to pick things out.Overall, waste of money.The opening on this is too small for even an average toddler to reach in, the lid has to be slid to the side to open(too difficult for little ones to do on their own), its obviously a ball so it can't be set down without rolling and the lid snaps off quite easily.Get another snack container.No wonder this was on clearance where I purchased it.I'm very glad I paid so little for it.The spork just does not make sense to me.I realize that some folks do not want toddlers to use a sharp point fork, but these tines made this one useless as a fork.The set is essentially two spoons (one just looks a little like a fork).The worst part about this set is the durability.The grippy handle of mine seems to have melted a little in the dishwasher and has food particles imbedded in it (I think it is tea leaves).Gross.Eventually, he was able to scoop cut-up food from the food tray, but not able to feed himself, yet.They are also pretty easy to clean, just soap and water and all the grease comes right off.I just wish it came with 2 spoons instead, since the fork is pretty much useless.It was a good price, but I found out later why.It sounds like a hair dryer is running even on this setting.After only a few days, the filter (which sets in a pool of water) starts to get moldy.The filter replacements are not cheap at $6 each.I recommend spending a bit more money and getting something that will last and not make your child sick from mold.The only thing it isn't is portable...I love love this swing.My baby sleeps in it 2 out of 5 nights a week.I love the different speeds, and I love(d) the sounds it played.Pros:-mac daddy of all swings.-plays ipod lullaby playlist!!-comfy and snuggly-doesn't scream "baby in the house"-great soothing sounds-has vibration!!-sturdyCons:-I bought mine used/new from a woman who said she never used it more than twice.-the whole sound thing stopped working after 2 months.No Ipod, no rain noises, NOTHING.It's okay.. i mean I can live without that as long as the vibration works and the swing itself swings... but when you pay this much for a swing and now I cant even really resale it when I am done with it.. boo.-HEAVY and bulky.Way way heavy.-basically impossible to transport over to grandmas for the weekend due to large size and weight and bulk.Even unassembled, this thing is a beast.So we just left it at grandmas and bought a rainforest swing for our place.Rainforest swing collapses flat practically, and can be crammed in a closet for a day if needs to be.it just doesn't have the vibration.Or the ipod feature :)-the toys SUCK.I just took the toy bar off and tossed it in a closet.Completely in the way and useless.sigh.This swing is GREAT.I love that you can switch the seat so it can swing baby back and forth or side by side.The music is great and the mommy tummy sounds are very soothing to her when she was first born.The only bad thing i hated is the buttons are blue led and shin VERY brightly and stay on the whole time so every time the swing wasn't blocking the buttons she woke up so I had to keep a folded recieving blanket on top of the buttons.I did have a graco car seat and it went in place of the swing seat easily and was SOOOOOO great and handy from going from the car to the swing when we got home to keep her asleep while i put up groceries, etc.The harness i love because it is not like a car seat harness where you got to fold her arm to get it on..this one it detaches from the bottom part to you can just sit her in the seat asleep and put the straps over her shoulders than get the waist straps put them together and than in the leg strap it made it so easy to get her buckled it but not wake her up.I wish more car seats made them like that.I would not buy this swing...unless you use the carseat that fits into it.We have tried it at different times from his birth to now - four months later.We have used the sounds as a soothing device for him while he is in his room (not in the swing), which has been nice.It may be the angle of the seat or something else that doesn't suit our little man.He won't stay in it very long before throwing a fit even if we put him in there completely happy.However, when we use our Snugride 32 seat in the swing, it works like a charm.He has fallen asleep and stayed asleep in that combination for hours.I would not make that mistake again.Did I think this swing was worth the money... between 3 - 10 months - yes, I thought this chair was the best investment, it was a distraction when we needed one - a napping place when no other would do... and a captivating toy for a standing and very curious baby.But here's the thing - desperate to find another chair for napping, I searched the internet high and low for a chair not bound by a 25 pound weight limit (which honestly Graco was stretching the truth because at 23 pounds our chair stopped swining at all.)The only chair I could find was a $35 Fisher Price infant-to-toddler rocker - no bells and whistles (just a small activity bar and a vibrating feature) but, it turns out that infant/toddler rocker was the better investment.My son is turning 2 and still uses the Fisher Price chair.We honestly solved the problem of white noise by buying an external CD player (or IPod) and just playing music while he relaxed in the chair.So, as the Sweet Peace is taking up room in the garage... the $35 toddler rocker keeps on going!If I had it to do over, I would have gone straight to the Fisher price chair and saved myself $120.It plays pre-recorded music, womb sounds, and has an iPod attachment.This part of the swing was a life saver, especially when one of my twins wanted to be held throughout the night.However, it doesn't lay flat (the seat does adjust to sit more upright, we needed it to lay a lot less upright though).There are no fun toys on the activity bar (the mirror is too small and the teething ring is too heavy).We've used it for a couple nights now.On its lowest setting, its a managable noise level.Just background noise.About 6 month ago our then 14 month old son had a very bad cold which resulted in breathing problems at night time.Our doctor recommended the purchase of a cool mist humidifier for his room to make breathing easier for him.We did some research on the internet and continuously stumbled across the Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier.It had pretty good overall ratings and was in an affordable price range so we went ahead and gave it a try.So far we haven't had any problems with our unit.It is super easy to use, has a large tank for your convenience, is quiet and doesn not (unlike some cheaper models) leave a water puddle on the carpet within 4 feet of the humidifier.I am glad we made that purchase however those filters do go bad rather quickly and replacements are on the pricey side.This might not be the solution for someone on a tight budget!It fit onto every chair we used both large and small.It also came in handy in restaurants as most of the high chairs used did not have safety belts.It's not really a high chair more just something to use to strap your kid with onto a chair.(mine is a wiggler so it was very necessary).If the chair didn't have a full back we propped something up behind him for support then strapped him in.Glad that I have this for travel -great value for the price!I can see myself using this at our relatives and future vacations.great product!My 6 month old loveeeesss this jumper.It's sturdy and I like the fact that there is two rings to attach toys to so she can play with them also.My only complaint is that it's kinda ugly...I really think Graco could come up with some better designs (maybe some girl-friendly ones!)And I'm able to get stuff done because she'll play in it for 20 minutes before she's done.This serves it's purpose.It is well made, but I find the tray bulky and unneccesary.It's also ugly (in my opinion) and is bulky to store.This product would have gotten a 5 star review if they made it more adjustable so that tall babies can use it too.If you have a tall baby, you better have really high door frames, because this just doesn't adjust high enough.We have it on the highest setting and our son's feet are flat on the ground.You want their toes to barely be touching the ground so they jump up and down.When their feet are flat on the ground they just sit there.Other than that, it's great.I see some three and two star reviews complaining that the height is not adjustable, what happened to creativity....If it is too long, tie a knot.Altering it to fit your use is not that difficult.Kids love it, lot of times they just fall asleep after playing in for a while.I dont advice, leaving the kids to sleep in it, but it is so comfortable.For the price, you can't ask for more.Has soft rubber bumpers to protect the kids when they hit hard objects.Very well thought and designed product.So we found another one as soon as we could.The Spring is very durable and the whole item is made very well.We have not had much luck with the activity mat, he would only stay there for a few minutes at most.It is safe and durable--very well made.A must for active babies.Baby LOVES this thing.Once she actually leaned forward on the tray and went to sleep in it.Stable enough not to dump her out even when she did that.The plastic tray doubles as a place to play with toys and a stabilizer, it seems.The bumpers really work.She could theoretically get her fingers caught between the bumper and a doorway now that she's bigger, but the design of the toy tray/bumper makes that unlikely (even now that she's at the upper end of recommended user size).It came out of the box very easy to put together.I can attach it to door frames without any assistance.Only wish it would accommodate larger babies... she's outgrowing it now.By way of comparison:  We also tried the Evenflo Jump Up, but it never seemed put together quite right.Less stable -- the baby would flop over forward in it.While that never happened, she'd get burns on her arms from leaning on its frame & ropes to stabilize herself.I had to get help to clamp it into doorways.My son was 11 weeks when we ordered this for him.Although it recommends that babies be older, we thought it might be good for him.He constantly kicks and jabs those little feet and it was starting to hurt my belly!It assembles fairly easily and is also extremely easy to move from door to door.There is a good 1-1.5 feet of play in the height so it works great for short or tall babies.We can practically let our little one sit on the floor in it, or put it up high enough that we can swing him back and forth.Love it and recommend it!The only problem is that it is not possible to wash the fabric toys.I have washed the seat cover, but the hand puppet, sun, and triangle are not washable as far as I can tell.I had high hopes for this activity center.I read the reviews and finally selected this one because it had geat reviews, the highest maximum length and my 4 month old is quite tall and I thoght she'd have longer to enjoy the toy.At best she would play with the wheel toy for 10 minutes, at worst she just sat in it and looked at me like "Why am I here?".I also found the book pages hard to move.I doubt she would be able to do it.To their credit, the product is made well enough that I could not fully disassemble it because three toys were impossible to remove once they were locked in place.In the end I returned it and bought the Blue Sky JumperooFisher Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo.When she had "head control" I put her in it and padded her with blankets (because she was too short for her feet to touch the bottom and I padded her around her seat, too).She loved it the moment I put her in it...seriously a good product!She's 4 months old now (no more padding) and it's SOOOO fun to watch your baby learn how to interact with the toys on the saucer.Personally, I'm bored with them, but she's in it every day and loves it everytime.I don't know how Baby Einstein figured out exactly what babies enjoy playing with but she's intrigued with every toy on the thing.It's a nice way for Mommy to be able to put the baby down while cooking dinner or folding laundry to keep her entertained.It gives her the opportunity to be upright and see what's going on, but have a good way to entertain herself as well.The older she gets the more she enjoys it because she can do more of the activities herself instead of needing me to show her how.I shopped around a lot and this is the best one I saw.Some of the activity centers really don't have much on the tray for the kids to do, play with, or learn.Oh and for some reason my daughter loves the alligator puppet.She will sit and kiss and talk to it forever.This is my first review online ever and thought I should start.I have based all of my purchase decisions for my new baby boy on reviews and once again this "technique" has not failed on me.Well, we put him in last night (had to put some blankets around him due to his small size) and the sun caught his attention immediately.My husband then started flicking it and suddenly, my little one started laughing so hard.This is the first time he has actually laughed this hard.To make the long story short, my baby played in there for about an hour last evening and slept real good last night.I guess he had fun!We tried and returned 3 other baby monitors.I was so frustrated that when I bought this one I unpacked it just enough to try it out really quick, fully prepared to be taking another monitor back to the store.But it worked great!!!The problems we had with other monitors were ridiculously heavy static at all times, and gritty sounds when the baby made noises.They also didn't get a good signal, or even any signal at all, in a different room.I had to be out in the hall right in front of baby's door.Worthless.This monitor is mostly clear (there's low, hardly noticeable static).We keep it just a few notches below the loudest setting and you can't hear the static unless the room is completely silent, and even then it's not bad.Also, the sounds from baby are SUPER clear.You can even hear someone whispering in the room.And we have the monitor about 10 feet away from the baby's crib!I also get a clear signal anywhere in our house, garage, or elsewhere on the property.We keep dogs at our house for training.We got another one of these monitors for their room.We actually have to keep in outside of their room because it's so sensitive we were hearing every shuffle and sniff all night and just need it to hear barking.Another perk to this device is it doesn't look all cutesy.But if you're not looking to spend a ton of money, and find that the cheap ones are crap, then this is the perfect buy.I'm on this site right now to buy a third one.We've had this over a year and it has been annoying the entire time.Poor reception if you get more than about 20 yards away, and muddled sound.The charge lasts about 20 minutes on a good day, you have to keep it charged constantly.The base runs out of charge after about 5 minutes, so we must always keep it plugged in and can't use it in other rooms.The base also often loses it's signal, so the monitor will start beeping and sometimes the only way to get it back on track is to get up, unplug it, and then turn it on again.Really annoying monitor, would not recommend.It's lightweight because it's mostly made of plastic.Seems like it would break within a year of mild use.Poor manueverablity and not very well made.Pros:Lightweightsnack traycute lookingCons:cheaply madepoor manueverablityflimsyHowever, overall the seat is only okay and possibly dangerous.The latch that secures the shoulder strap in front of the child's chest is flimsy.It is a regular latch like you might find on a dog collar or closing a backpack, which would be fine if it was made of really hard plastic and gave a nice, loud "click" when it was properly engaged, but it isn't and it doesn't.It latches together with only a faint "click" sound and after months of use that sound went away.I took it off to clean it thinking it must be clogged with milk and when I was holding it in my hands I realized that if I pulled really hard the latch came undone!I called Peg Perego to get a new one and that one did the same thing so I have stopped using the seat.If it can be that easily separated by hand, how would it perform in an accident?I purchased this for my daughter to use with our bugaboo because it seemed to be the best.I regret it and can't wait to get rid of it.Trying to set this up with a fussy baby is not easy.Also, peg perego customer service is a joke.I wont even begin on this topic.I spend a good 10-15 min every time adjusting the straps and locking the front buckle (which requires you to line up two plastic pieces and slide them into the center locking mechanism - try that with a squirmy baby!)I think this is a major safety issue, since I can see some people may not bother to untwist the straps if they are in a hurry.My boy still doesn't understand so I proceed to strap him in while cursing the car seat for the duration of the strap-in procedure.We have this car seat installed on my husband's car and a Graco in mine.It is heavier, but because it's better cushioned.(I really don't try to remove it from the car, unless I absolutely have to).The Graco is lighter, more portable, questionable safety IMO, easier to strap baby in, and of course, cheaper.Also, my boy outgrew the Graco a long time ago, but is still using the peg perego.Gives us a break from having to buy two replacement car seats at the same time.....I purchased BRU flannel sheets as well as these Tadpoles sheets.The Tadpole organic sheets win hands down.I purchased extra Tadpole sheets and they are the only ones I use for now.As my baby gets older, I'll probably use the other ones, but the Tadpoles are my first choice.Soft, fluffy, tight fit on mattress.The natural color sheets are softer than the chocolate color sheets - don't know why.I'd stick with the natural colored sheets.These flannel sheets are very nice given the small market there seems to be for flannel crib sheets!They're nice and thick and washed well.(We have their jersey crib sheets and they are GREAT!)These sheets are just what we needed for our little one before the giant snows of 2010 hit.Very soft, big enough to swaddle a newborn.The stubby handle is perfect for little hands.So far, we have use this for bananas, pears and even ice cubes to sooth those itching gums.I purchased these for my 6 month old to have a place to sit and play instead of on our hardwood floors.Great product!The product description called it a cuddler, or that it had security blanket styling, but I did not find this to be true.I was hoping it would be snuggly so my daughter could hug it while in her bouncer but I found its too small, and its too flat to be a doll.The size is similar to that of a washcloth.The body is soft, yet flat, but it unfortunately has two sharp tags on it.The burlap medallion is also rigid, preventing it from easily crumpling and bending.I think it would be much more functional if it were bigger.The product was as described.It seems high quality.It is for my baby due this month, so he hasn't used it yet.I washed it on regular cycle and it washed well and dried well too.(i like to clean stuff before use and it held up well)The toys on this walker are more entertaining than any walker I've seen.We had a Jeep walker and another brand and these toys are exceptional.Don't let the picture fool yo;, what appears red in the picture is actually HOT PINK!My husband was pretty upset when I pulled this out of the box.It is otherwise pretty gender neutral.Folds down flat with just the push of a button which is great for travel.I would recommend this walker to anyone!Great for hardwood floors as well as some carpeting.It rolls very easily and doesn't get snagged on things like I noticed with the Jeep & other brands.My 7 month old daughter loves this walker.It took her awhile to get it going on our carpet, but on the tile floors she was zooming around after a couple of days.I am glad I read reviews before I puchased this walker.My daughter is only 6 months old is 26 inches long and she can reach the ground!!She is used to her activity center and jumper that she can turn 360 degrees in, and for obvious reasons- you cant turn all the way around in this.This makes her a little frustrated but I think when she figures out how to use it, she will love it!They screw right onto my medela hand pump and can easily be stored for later use.These bottles are BPA free.He eats like a champ from these bottles and we haven't had any issues going between breast feeding and using these bottles.bottles.I bought these for the collars as my pump came with 3 bottles but only one collar and one nipple.I bought these bottles since I have the Medela pump.They work great with the pump and my 6 month old likes them.My only complaint is that when I boil the bottles to sterilize the caps stick together sometimes.Then, when I pry the caps apart, they are too stretched out to work anymore.So, I wish they sold just caps or had extra in this set.I only use these bottles to pump into and store breast milk in the fridge.They work great for that as they fit with the Medela pump.My only complaint is that the oz markings are quickly wearing off.Both of my children use this booster seat, and overall we like it a lot.We still use the tray for my daughter.My only frustrations are with attaching the tray and the mounting of the back rest.The three little locking buttons on each side of the chair make it a bit harder to attach and detach than our previous slide-out tray.This also sometimes makes lifting the tray difficult and messy when mealtime is over.Once I received it, I was a little bit disappointed and thought I should have got one with soft head/back support.But once I use it, the head/back rest isn't the problem at all.My daughter never once knocks her head on the plastic back.Lightweight, easy to use and affordable price.GREAT product!I wish I had bought this product earlier.It grows with your child: for infants, with the tray; for toddlers, as a seat booster.So you don't need to buy a booster when they grow up; and it doesn't take much space.Besides, it is very easy to clean: you just put it into the dishwasher.Before having this one, we bought another infant chair that had some cushions, and it was a nightmare to clean.And infants can be very messy when they are learning to eat!Another thing I love about this chair: as a booster, it can be secured to the chair.Most boosters don't have this option; if your toddler moves a lot, you will really appreciate this.I purchased this for my 6 month old.The print is cute and even though i think the toys look boring my five month old loves to play with them and proudly pulls the frog to hear the music.It allows me to take a shower while he plays!But he did not like this chair until about 3 months old.The Fisher-Price Hoppy Days Bouncer is a good bouncer for the price.Below is a list of what I like/dislike about the bouncer.Pros:1.Easy to clean (cover is machine washable)3.Nice motion (vibration or rocking with your foot)Cons:1.The toy bar is just okay (the song the frog plays gets annoying and the other toys don't do anything).2.I wish the hard plastic at the base of the seat was at the side or covered with more padding (my son's feet hit the plastic when he bounces himself).I received both fisher price giraffe stacking toys.Every ring makes some sort of noise.They are all covered in fabric so it doesn't hurt if the little guy conks himself in the head.He tugs on and chews on the ears and feet of the base.He always gets excited when I set him down in front of this toy and shortly there after rings are everywhere!Then he has to work at going and getting one to rattle or chew on which is good exercise.I recommend this toy.This stacker only has three rings.I assume that if we didn't already have the Fisher Price Star Stacker that lights up and plays music:Little Super Star Classical Stackerthat we may have liked this stacker okay.The rings on this stacker are supposed to crinkle and rattle...the crinkle is pretty weak and the other two rings have very similar rattles, not as much variety as I would have liked to see.This is simply the best baby mattress you can find, unless you get a thicker one made the same way!We didn't get our coir baby mattresses for our twins from this vendor, but coir mattress prices have been coming down and I expect will become a big seller on Amazon.There is nothing better than coir, mainly for comfort.If this mattress were thicker, I'd compare it to a college competition level wrestling mat only with a little crunch to it.This mattress is breathable.A lot of people don't know it but coir is a material that is naturally not a habitat for dust mites, it is naturally free of bacteria and fungal spores and it's not attractive to parasites.It has long been used in India and Sri Lanka for comfort and health, and has been produced for years in Mexico and several other countries.We're very pleased with our coir baby mattresses.Then, I started researching cribs and stumbled upon information about cribs and especially crib mattresses containing chemicals that leach formaldehyde.The mattresses are worse, though, since it is the law that they be flame retardant.Babies spend SO much of their time in them, in VERY close proximity.There is even research to suggest that a leading cause of SIDS is these chemicals that the babies ingest.So, while on the hunt for a healthier mattress, I saw many so called "organic" products.Naturepedic in particilar markets an "organic" mattress.Per the USDA, a product only has to contain 70% organic ingredients to use the phrase "organic" on its packaging.So, the mattress might be made with organic cotton, but there are still other components.And unless you have a doctor's prescription for no flame retartants, or have a mattress made with wool, a natural flame retardant (which this mattress has), you're still going to get the bad chemicals.So, for the same price as a Naturepedic with the bad chemicals, I got this mattress (found it on sale through another website, even though I'd have gladly paid Amazon's price!).It is made entirely of the following:  A core of organic coir (coconut fibers), organic wool, and 2 unbleached cotton covers.The wool acts as a water barrier itself, so you don't have to use horrible vinyl mattress pads.(Vinyl is one of the most toxic plastics known).The wool is also anti dust mite.It is firm, yet springy.All in all, I believe I found the BEST crib mattress out there.This, coming from an "organic OCD" mother, as my husband calls me, is a very high praise.[...].[...].[...It does the main function very well; allows baby to jump.My baby has a lot of fun jumping but the toys could be better.The "peek-a-boo" horse toy really sucks.It doesn't move much to really play "peek-a-boo."The "walls" that semi hides the horse come off super easy.The light for the "carrot" toy isn't working after couple uses.We rarely turned on the light since it's so low intensity anyway; barely noticeable.Probably better in the dark but when will I put my baby in it while it's dark and I can't see her?.The pigs are cute but same as the horse; barely moves.Love the spinning toy though; moves easily and well.Due to all these problems, I gave it 3 stars only.My baby likes the toys on her Baby Einstein Exersaucer better.My baby loves to jump in this.I didn't bother sending it back because it would be such a hassle.I know it's not amazon's fault but I still give the product 3 out of 5.We had an older Rainforest jumperoo that was given to us that he LOVED, but we wanted another one so he could have one at home and the babysitters house.We chose this one because of all the features and toys it had on it and I liked the fact that it was educational as well (sings ABC's and teaches colors and animals, ect).Also, with the rainforest jumper, he would put his arms down in the seat, out of the leg hole and get stuck that way, in this jumperoo, he can't do that, nor does he try, which is great!It's been a few weeks and he no longer needs the added support to reach the floor, but he is still a little confused as to what to do with the toys on it.I am dissapointed with the little pig farm and the cow that's on it.I guess with the pigs you are supposed to be able to hit one and the others pop up higher, but they barely move at all so there's really nothing to play with and with the cow, you are supposed to hit a button and he ducks down and then back up, but again, he barely moves, so what a waste.He will just sit there and be amazed by the lights.He loves the music, as well as the ABC's and rhymes.Only one complaint is that the toy insert has stickers on it.The stickers were already starting to peel when I got it and on top of that I have a drooly baby so they just peeled off and made a mess.I love the chair I would just suggest to the makers to forget the stickers.I love the fact it will grow with her and its so easy to fold and go.The Rain Forest Healthy Care Booster Seat is an ideal product for Grandma's house, for those with smaller homes and limited space for baby items, and for travelling.Larger children may not be able to use this product for any extended period of time.A 21 pound, 28 inch tall infant has about 1 inch clearance between the tray and himself when the tray is in the most forward position.He is six months old and this is the first time that he has been able to use the chair.The chair is not particularly sturdy, although I do not think it would qualify as being flimsy.The tray snaps onto a protruding button and pulls off; a larger, older toddler might easily be able to disengage the tray.Finally, this is somewhat expensive when evaluated against its useful life.Those who have the room for a larger, regularly designed highchair would be advised to go that route.All in all, the Rainforest Booster seat is a good product and has valuable uses in certain circumstances.When my son was smaller we used this when we went out and his high chair at home.At this point I've figured out I could probably have done without the high chair since it takes up alot of room and now I have to store it.This seat adjusts in height so it has been good at any table.The toys it comes with are just a plus.I can see her using it for a lot longer as a booster chair as well.Of course, all that depends on each child.My daughter has several allergies so this chair goes everywhere with us.The toy insert keeps younger babies occupied and is cute.The only problem I found with the toy insert was the paper stickers that started peeling off with continued use and washing.pros: well made, good qualitygrows with baby (adjustable table and height and chair back can be removed)easy to clean (just wipe chair with clorox wipes, table can be put in dishwasher or easily hand washed)easy to use while holding baby in one handlight and easy to travel withfits on most chairstoy insert keeps baby busycons: paper stickers peel off with continued washingstraps tend to get gunky, especially if you have a very messy baby (think chicken puree everywhere)...not a huge problem though since you can just take out the straps and wash them.I let  them sit in a cup of vinegar for a while before rinsing them out, takes care of  both stains and smells!Update: My daughter, who is now 4, still fits comfortably in her booster seat and enjoys sitting at the dining table with us.The height is just right for her to eat at the dining table(she is 33 lbs and 40 inches!).This seat truly grows with your child!These don't require any drilling which is nice.Unfortunately our drawers are flat when pushed in so these do not work.The template makes it a no brainer.I can't find anything that I don't like about them.These are easy to install (but somewhat tedious when installing 30).Given enough time and the will a child could eventually accidentally jam something in the outlet even with these covers on.We purchased these to install when our little one was starting to crawl.I was so worried with the outlet plugs that we would forget to put it back or he'd get ahold of one and choke on that or something along those unsafe lines.SOOO worth the money.We have many many outlets covered that we use often and have not had a single problem.BUY THEM!LOVE,  these are a lot easier than the child safety inserts you put in and take out that a child could choke on, my husband put in about 30ish within a matter of hours and they are so easy to use, they look fantastic also just like the original outlets, actually I think they look even better than the original outlets.TO be honest, I only got this because it looked so cute.after reading the reviews, i wasn't expecting it to be super useful.However, to my surprise, my baby really likes it and sits on it a lot!(he is 10 months old).The kids just play with it, throw it around, and sit on it.so it's quite a multi-use product.I think it's money well spend!He grabs the side of the cubes and shakes them.Cloth diapers don't hold back much.I was sent the wrong items by this seller and it was frustrating to deal with.However, they did refund me.Protecting nature but getting wooden toys, loving birds and trees :)This rattle is adorable, however there are 2 leaves on it that seem like Baby would knock himself pretty hard.If he gets going slamming it around I know it would result in a bump on the head- in order to avoid this I am returning.Please note that you aren't buying a piece of luggage...this is simply a shaped, zippered canvas bag with wheels that makes it a slightly better option that having no wheels at all.The Good:1.Protected the carseat well.Gives you a lot of extra space to store other items in - we stuffed this extra space with a TON of extra diapers, and didn't need to load our luggage with the extra bulk.Can load this up with anything you aren't afraid to get smashed up in transit.The Bad:1.My Britax Marathon carseat was too hard to fit into the bag.Design of the bag makes it impossible to fit easily.Had to muscle and shoe-horn my seat in, use both hands and two feet, plus the help of another person.2.VERY hard to start the bag rolling.From a standing position, simply using the handle and straps provided (either the long strap that attaches via clips, or the short handle at the top of the bag) just drug the bag in a standing position, scraping the whole way.I ALWAYS had to kick the bottom of the bag while pulling forward to "get it started".3.Awkard to wheel around.This bag tipped over every time we hit something with it.4.VERY hard to wheel when you also have another piece of luggage to wheel.Small handle at the top isn't really useful.The top of the bag is at a height where you can't keep it low enough with the small handle to keep it rolling without popping back to standing position...so you stoop down about a foot to keep it low...the longer detachable strap is very long, but this makes the back of the bag almost ride on the ground.OVERALL REVIEW: This could have been designed much, much better...problem is that carseats are light compared to their bulk.Designers should have actually tested this, provided better handle options, and figured out how to make it work as designed.The plastic wheel/stand molding beneath the bag broke after our third trip, so it needs to be carried everywhere.Perhaps if exclusively gate checked this scenario can be avoided, so that you have contact with fewer "throwers" (baggage handlers) but good luck if you're traveling solo and also toting your baby supplies, a toddler and a stroller.Because it seals completely you can't use it to push the kids around, like some other products.I will be looking at other brands to replace it.This bag was a life saver for getting thru the airport and we checked it at the gate.I used this travel bag last week to fly with my Britax Marathon car seat and it worked very well.The bag is good quality for the price and made it much more convenient to take our carseat.We gate checked it on the first leg of the flight since we were renting a car at the other end and needed to make sure the car seat got there with us, then we checked it at the counter on the way back.One of the benefits of this bag is that there is a lot of extra room to stash a few other things in with it.I was able to pack my daughters clothing in a separate bag and put it inside with the car seat which made it possible to take a smaller backpack carry on for me.If you do not put anything else in with the car seat then your child could easily sit in it (cover on) and be wheeled through the airport.All in all, it is well worth the money if you are needing to take a car seat with you on a trip/vacation.Having taken two previous flights and damaging our car seat by awkwardly carrying it by the straps, I ordered this bag for our most recent flight and I am so glad I did.After reading the other reviews about how the bottom fell off, I was worried, but our bag came with the bottom securely attached leaving me to believe that the company either fixed the problem or they have quality control issues.If the bottom does fall off of yours or the zipper breaks, do not throw it away.Take it to a luggage/shoe repair shop and for a reasonable price, the bag can be fixed.I have an Evenflo Triump car seat and man was I nervous putting it in the bag the day of the flight.It...just...barely...fit.Like a glove.Why does stress make us so stupid?At first I couldn't understand why they didn't put four wheels on this so you wouldn't have to tilt it to pull it, but then the laws of physics dawned on me and I realized that this was truly the best design.I noticed several couples struggling with their unbagged car seats.This is so worth the money even for one trip.We do have to adjust the back down to get it to fit in the bag (a simple adjustement).This is fine if you plan to check your car seat, but honestly we found the one that is a backpack style is more convenient in general.This one just always seemed a bit awkward, the weight always seemed to be a little unevenly distributed with this one which made towing it behind us a bit more of a challenge.Our Britax Boulevard fits with plenty of space which may be why the weight shifted so much.We finally lost this bag when it came back with all the bars on the bottom having been ripped off, I am guessing they got caught on something during handling and ripped off that way.The bag held up for close to 2 years.He likes using it, and it's really nice if you like modern looking devices.I have heard these do wear out, so longevity may be an issue if you are passing them on from child to child.Personally, I like my traditonal Fisher Price Bosster seat.He likes it, and my wife likes it because it's easy to clean.baby (10 months) was happymommy and daddy were happy, even after carrying baby in sling for hourseasy to put on and off (once you figure it out the first time)definitely spreads the weight between the lower back and the shouldersI wish I knew that this thing was known for causing back pain.It is pretty useful and sturdy but for the price I think it should be designed to minimize back pain.Sit breaks (needed to relieve the back pain) are awkward because of where the baby hangs (I'm 5'3").My baby is only a month old & 11lbs.I still use it but when I think of taking longer trips my back keeps me from taking them and I go home.Also, it was a bit complicated getting the baby in and out initially.And I will say walking him in this thing is a surefire way to get him to nap.When my daughter was looking for baby carriers, I really encouraged her to purchase a Baby Bjorn Synergy carrier.Several of the individual who would be using the carrier are hot-natured, so the lighter, aerated fabric seemed to be a real positive.Further, I liked the fact that one could position an older infant facing outward while still carrying the child on one's front.The Baby Bjorn Synergy might have worked well if all the adults carrying the baby had had healthy backs.We thought the lumbar support was to have helped in this area.Instead, we found that because of the waist strap,  the baby's weight was concentrated on our lower back instead of resting on our hips as weight would with a good quality backpack.My son-in-law is an avid hiker and even he could not reconfigure the Baby Bjorn so that the weight was distributed more comfortably.Thus, we were unable to use the Synergy for carrying the baby for any length of time.I would recommend looking at the Beco carrier which has excellent lumbar support and is easily adjustable for multiple users.I was so excited to get this in the mail.I slipped it on and put my daughter in...first of all, in the forward position the flap that is folded down reaches right at the baby's mouth so they are gagging essentially.The major "NO" factor is that my baby's thighs after literally 5 minutes of use were bright red and I mean painful looking.She was excited to be facing forward but there is no way I am keeping this.Too many things are wrong with this carrier.Skip it!The back support does the job well.I had tried the Moby wrap and my babies head fell out and I freaked!Very well made and washable.My husband was pretty picky on this particular carrier so we got it even though it is a bit expensive.The back support is so important.I have had 2 back surgeries, and I can walk around with her in the bjorn for an hour or so without getting too sore.My husband loves it, very comfy, and the baby is comfy in it.We use it a lot, and are glad we bought it.I also have a sling and a wrap, and I think this is the carrier our baby prefers, she is not fond of the sling.We purchased the Bjorn Synergy carrier for our newborn daughter, and it has been one of the best investments in gear that we've made.When she's fussy, putting her in the Bjorn immediately calms her down.Sometimes she'll fall asleep, but other times she'll be bright-eyed and spend her time looking around and taking in the sights as we go about our chores.Also, a note for tall folks.I'm 6'5" and my wife is 5'11", and we are both able to use this carrier comfortably.At first I felt I couldn't use it, even with the straps at the longest settings, because the lumbar support panel sat up way too high on my back, but then we figured out that the lumbar support will slide down along the straps, and allows for adjustments that are NOT SHOWN IN THE MANUAL.All the manual says about the lumbar support is that you should tighten the lumbar straps first, it does not describe that the lumbar support is mobile and can be adjusted up and down the straps.The original was so much easier to set up, adjust, and put on.Most of the time I get frustrated.So far, I tried putting my baby in it 10-15 times.It is hands down one of the best baby purchases we have made.He plays in it, sleeps in it when we travel, and loves it.It's also not too big, so it fits in any room in our small apartment.Easy to set up and down.Worth the money!Besides the obvious benefits offered by this item, I also find it a much better napping and sleeping place for my baby.She slept 9 hours in it, the longest ever!Again, you are paying for it's design though.Yes its more expensive and yes it does not have all the bells and whistles - (bassinet, mobiles, diapers caddy, changing station) that the Gracos do - but honestly you don't really need all those things and all they do is make it heavier, harder to pack, harder to set up etc.This thing weighs nothing, packs in seconds, sets up in seconds.If you want a portable crib you don't plan on moving anywhere fine - save the money and get a graco - but isn't the whole point that it should be portable.It unfolds in mere seconds which is not just nice, but necessary when traveling long distances with tired children.The mattress is cushy.The frame is well padded.The only drawbacks that I have found relate to using the bed with active toddlers.As a result, it is much easier for a child to get the leverage they need to pull themselves up and over.When this has happened the bed has remained standing which I think speaks to a safety-consciousness in its construction.Also, on hardwood floors and with a bouncy child, the bed can slide a bit, potentially putting your child near objects they should not be in close proximity to.These are really just nuisances, that can be avoided, however.We love travelling with this bed.My wife and I took a short getaway trip this week (our spring vacation) and we took our 18-month-old baby along.We stayed in a small cabin with three very small rooms.We brought along our BabyBjorn Travel Crib to provide sleeping quarters for the little one and we set it up in the kitchen where we could close the little dear off from the rest of the cabin.This BabyBjorn Travel Crib has proven to be quite useful.We set it up at Grandma's house when we take him over for a little visit.In one instance we checked it in as a bag on an airplane trip and then used it while visiting another couple.We've taken it along on many car trips.The bottom rests directly on the floor and has a soft mattress.We both think it's well designed and much better than other available travel cribs.I might add that it's beginning to look rather small relative to the boy and probably won't be useful beyond another year.Gary Petersonit's light, a breeze to put together, and my baby sleeps in it no problem at all.It is much too big.It must be checked, which in this age of paying for checked bags this is just one more thing we would have had to pay to check.We sent it back.The mattress appeared plush and the crib seemed like it would do serve it's purpose well as a sleeping place, but it just wasn't airline travel friendly in our opinion.If we drove while traveling we would have kept this crib.But with the number of times airlines have lost my bags if I had to check our travel crib when flying I'd also have to have a backup plan on where my baby could sleep when the airline lost the crib.He cried every time.I think it may have been too much of a shock to go from a firm mattress in a regular crib to a soft thinner mattress on the ground.I think the product is really well made, but I guess we're back to the PNP for travel!I have a feeling this will be a staple in my car for those random times it is needed in addition to planned travels.I've seen it nearly $50 more at other retailers.Yes, it is expensive, but I think it was money well spent for our purposes.I LOVE this machine!I love the fact that the blade can be taken out after blending and you can scrape EVERYTHING out of the bowl without trying to work around a blade.I can not say enough good things about this product.I got my lid stuck and couldn't get it off so I came online looking for reviews with the same problem and they said if you aren't careful it gets stuck and to gently/carefully twist the lid in the opposite way and it pops right off THANK GOSH for those reviews (I almost gave up and almost threw it away) it worked and lid came off and from there on i make sure I line the tabs up with the holes and haven't had a problem since.(the reviews were on another site).I use this a few times a week to make quick meals or batches of baby food to freeze for my baby.Don't fill it too high though or it could bubble over.It blends very well, and the best part is that it is sooo easy to clean, just rinse the parts off immediately before any food has time to dry and you will be all set.Sometimes I prefer smaller size holes, but having options for portion size is great.I have been looking for a way to shield the sun from the rear window of my car for months now...I found a solution and this is it!Not only does it block the sun from the rear window for my little one in her car seat it also blocks it from the side as well.Since I live in Alaska it is so difficult to get any and all suction cups to stay on a window due to the cold.This shade is just the ticket!This bag seems to be durable(will see though, as I just started using it).But what is the point of using a bag if you need to take the wheels off to fit the stroller into the bag???If travelling alone, you have to put the stroller into the bag long before coming to the aircraft otherwise you will hold a line behind you struggling with the bag and the stroller that fit snuggly!This bag is made very well.It's almost impossible to do if you are by yourself with a baby.I like the higher handlebars as I hate to have to hunch over a stroller as it hurts my neck and shoulders.But one detail is off and it's very off -- the seat back is too low as one particular reviewer is upset about as well.He is 99th percentile in height.But even though he's far from weighing 75 pounds (he is 28 lbs) I don't know if we'll be able to use this stroller beyond the coming Spring because when the visor is opened his head absolutely presses against it.We have the Joovy Kooper and the seat back and height of visor is fine on that one and I felt confident buying this one without trying it out in a store but I'm disappointed.But in each of the Joovy strollers we own there is one flaw that pretty strongly affects functionality and isn't easily dismissed.In the Zoom the problem is the low seat back keeping us from using this stroller as long as we should and in the Kooper it is how the brakes on the back wheels stick out too much and are in no way whatsoever designed to allow you to bump the stroller up and down stairs.Both of which are bigger issues than say, size of a basket or whatever.Added note later on: Another flaw to report - the strap behind the seat that raises or lowers the seat does not lock properly.The strap just slides through it with a minimal amount of pressure.Potentially, these will work even better than the old green frog hamper they will replace.Funny how his clothes still end up on the floor but its a work in progress.They are well sized and appear durable.Make sure you check the dimensions.I didn't and was disappointed.That is my fault for not checking.I give this three stars because the smallest two are so little I have no idea what we will be able to put in there.I was hoping to use these for my son's stuffed animals.This is an OK product but what can you expect for this price point.Very cheap looking and thin.But better than nothing, I guess.I am surprised the suction cups stick so well to our bathtub and we have it loaded up pretty full.Have had it about 2-3 weeks and definitely worth the money!The package was so small I thought it would be a teeny bag.But, I opened it up and the most amazing thing happened, it stretched and stretched and....It holds all her bath toys and has space for more!The construction of the netting is not stringy or flimsy.The suction was a non-issue.Very good buy.If the whole point of buying this is so that you can HANG it on the bath wall......PASS!It doesnt even remotely stay.Im not bothering sending it back (to much of a hassel)as i can still put the toys in it but I did want it to hang on the wall.VERY DISSAPOINTED!I was a little skeptical ordering this due to the listed dimensions, but it stretches to accommodate an amazingly large amount of toys.We have quite a bit of weight in ours and it sticks very well.Occasionally one of the suction cups will pop off, but is immediately and easily reapplied by wetting the cup a little.I did read a few reviews about this not sticking up but I figured that either the owner put too much weight in the bag or put the suction cups on a bumpy surface...Well, I followed the instructions exactly and purposely only put a few toys in the bag to test it out.Still fell...boo.They're too big to be over the shoulder "burp pads", but would probable be great protection during tummy time.They aren't completely water proof...if they get soaked and you leave it sitting there, they will soak through.But, if you pick it up once the liquid gets on it, then it prevents the furniture from getting wet.It comes in darker colors so you don't have to worry so much about dirt and spills.The wheels are thicker and wider than your average umbrella stroller which makes it much easier to manuver and less likely to get caught up on uneven surfaces.The stroller has that 3 handle design, and beieve it or not you can actually steer with ease using any of the three handles.The kids are very comfortable and really like sitting next to eachother.The 5 point harness is a plus, and it is easily adjustable so that parents do not have to remember which seat belonged to what kid.The baskets on the bottom are a bit small, but there are 2 of them, and they are large enough to hold the necessities for example a trip to the play ground or a short run into the store.(Please see cons for more info about the using it in the store)The grab bar is sturdy and can outlast even rough kids like mine.Its great for longer trips or for areas with a lot of action and the kids need something to grab onto and hold them in while they are trying to lean out of the stroller.(please see cons about the grab bar during frequent use)The adjustable back works like a drawstring.No kidding.It has a drawstring with a clip that lowers and raises the back to the appropriate level.I havn't had any problems with it so far, but If your kid is too big you might have problems with it unless you figure out how to reinforce it somehow.The positive aspect is that you can adjust it to any specific location, unlike others where you only get to choose between 2-3 preset recline modes (if any).For those of you trying to get around in a subcompact like, say for example a 4 door hatchback Yaris,and like me you have 2 carseats preventing you from folding down the seats, This stroller WILL NOT fit in your itty bitty trunk.in fact, it will barely fit in your back seat on the floor.Unfortunately for me I have to put it in my front seat if I plan on using it.I bought a single umbrella stroller specifically for this car because of the lack of space.The user descriptions in other reviews helped to convince me that this would fit as if it was 2 umbrella strollers but it's a little bit bigger than that.This lost a full star because of that.If the stoller was about 2-3 inches smaller I would have given it 5 stars because I could fit it in the trunk.This stroller doesn't fit through single doors or narrow aisles.I have turn it sideways and drag it through a single door, which only works if the door is automatic or if someone is kind enough to open the door for me.When driving down narrow aisles I have to be careful not to knock anything off the shelves.I didn't deduct any stars for that because I kinda new that going in.The grab bar is great, but cannot be convenient or realistically used if you need to collapse it several times a day/week.The grab bar needs to be removed before you can collapse the stroller.The bar is quite sturdy, which also means that it is quite securly held onto the bars which make it too much of a hassle to snap on and off several times a day/week.Overall impression:I really enjoy the stroller and I feel it will outlast any abuse it will suffer.The cons listed above do not outweigh the pros it has provided.I do wish that it was a back/front double stroller instead of a side by side, so that I could fit through doorways etc.I wish it would fit in my car correctly, but shame on me for getting a teeny car :)I was looking for something that I could whip in and out of my trunk in a breeze and have the kids strapped in and ready to go.I wanted a stoller that I could use to run several errands in one shot before the kids got sick of getting in and out of the car.I needed something to keep them more secure, sanitary and still have enough room in the baskets to do light shopping.As far as what I was looking for vs what I got...Well everyone has to compromise so it doesn't work under all circumstances but it'll do.It is secure and sanitary, and It is a MUCH better option than a shopping cart because the kids will sit in it happily for much much much longer than the standard shopping cart.My grandaughter loves these balls.she is motivated to crawl and move about to get the red one, and seems especially interested in the sticker on the top of the ball.I am glad they came with four because they tend to scatter a lot and I don't have to get up so often.I think this product is great for all ages and it's prices good as well.Definitely a must have for the toy box.My son discovered small sensory balls (a bit bigger than a golf ball) at a Gymboree class and wouldn't let go of three of them for an hour.I searched for the small sensory balls everywhere but couldn't find them but I thought these would be pretty good.When the box arrived and we opened it, he just walked away.Months later, he still does not play with them.Even when I throw one at him or hand him one, he plays with it for a second or two by throwing it and walking it away.I didn't want to give these a low rating because the balls themselves are good quality and it's not their fault that he doesn't like them.He loves to push them around and chase them, then mouth them when he catches them.In other settings, he's really enjoyed the soft, spiky sensory balls and for under $13 I thought this was a great set to have at home.As with any new toy, he immediately delighted in them, but days later they were left ignored.My little guy is 9mos old now and I think once he's more into interactive play he will go back to these.I could easily see having held off on this purchase.On a different note, I've worked with children with sensory issues and these would have been wonderful balls to have for them.Especially for children who have a hard time with light touch.He is 9 months old and can hold them easily and loves to throw them with one hand.These are the first toys he goes to.The blue one arrived deflated with a hole in it.Super bummed out!I ordered these just to have some balls in our toy collection...She's 6 months and is intrigued by the texture, but would not normally chose this a  toy to play with.Only when we bust them out does she show any interest.They are a little large for her hands, but she can hold them with both, and she likes to put them up to her mouth and put her tongue on the prickley texture.Perhaps she'll appreciate them more when she's a little bigger and can roll them around.These balls were a big hit, even the father of the child played with them.It works well and I would strongly recommend these for infants to toddlers.Red, blue, green, and yellow are going to be the first colors most children learn.Second, the texture is distinctly different yet not unpleasant or unsafe because the spikes are soft (as is each entire ball).Third, because of the soft texture, once your child starts throwing these balls, you don't have to worry about any damage to your home or to your child.Of course, once a child can really get some lift on his throws, there could be trouble!He likes chasing the ball, catching it and flinging it about.It was too narrow to fit the doorway, and too wide with the extension.It looks alot better compared to the Evenflo, and it is definitely more durable.I like how it comes with 3 extension so it can pretty much fit any doorway in our house.I bought this stroller for my 5-6 month old daughter, since all we had previously was a car seat stroller frame.She was starting to be able to sit up on her own and I felt like she needed something she could see out of better and sit up in.I tested an equivalent model of this stroller at Babies R Us before I bought it (it is the same as the Combi Cosmo EX) but I liked this color and pattern better than what they had at BRU.Likes: Very light for travel/putting in the car, large canopy (for a lightweight stroller), window in canopy so that you can see baby while pushing, tall handles, bar style handle makes it easy to steer with one hand, multiposition recline, color and pattern of the Jade style, stands up on own when foldedDislikes: Basket is a little hard to get to and has a bar in the middle, wheels do look a little flimsy and don't take long to get chewed up pretty good, have to lock wheels to fold up properlyI can't decide if I like the folding mechanism or not.I like that it should "latch" together to stay folded automatically, but it often doesn't work for me.If you plan to put a stroller through a lot of use and travel, maybe a more expensive one would be sturdier (this one is holding up fine for me).Appreciate it every time I need to pack the Stroller or Unpack it which I do both with only one hand!We've been using the Combi stroller for about 5 months.Hard to get the seat in and out of the stroller.-seat reclines via a string-pull-basket is small and nearly impossible to access-some of the fabric is very flimsy, like that that forms the infant bassinet (the zipper and both velcros on ours went bust almost immediately...don't think you're really supposed to use the bassinet function)-the fold in the adult handle pinches my hands when I'm walking with the stroller-5 pt harness shoulder straps nearly useless...they don't adjust nearly small enoughThere's probably more bad but I've picked it apart enough already.We spent over $300 on the seat/stroller system and we just hate it.A friend recommended them, we played with them in the store, but sometimes you just have to use it to know for sure.I have the entire Combi Cosmo system with the car seat and base and it's great that the car seat fits right into the stroller so I don't have to take him out.We had a much older Combi stroller and this one rolls much smoother.I like that the seat reclines so he can sleep.We don't tend to carry a whole bunch of stuff with us so the lack of storage space in the stroller is not an issue.Tested it out at a store and passed on it.Used to have an older model that came with a parent organizer, but the folding mechanism broke.Ultimately bought a Maclaren Quest as a replacement.Pros:LightweightBelly barNarrow/good for city & small shops.Cons:No cupholder for adultsVery poor manueverability/poor ridefolding mechamism breaksnot durableI had the graco melbourne stoller that thing was huge.It took up the whole trunk.Which on an umbrella stroller does not happen.My child is almost a year old and I still change his diaper in this stroller instead of using the nasty restroom changers they have.This stroller I stuck inside with my evenflo carseat at the airport in a bag and it was super light weight.I would buy this stroller again.How many strollers do that?My old one I couldn't take it off and laundry it.The only bad thing is that there is not really a useable basket, which is fine with me because I just stick reusable tote bags to the bag handle and it works.There is a really nice pocket in the back for parents to put keys into and so on.I can even stick a bottle water in there.It comes with a cupholder for the child.It fits super well down isles while shopping and people are amazed that they don't have to move there shopping cart over for me to get around them.I searched and searched for a lighter weight stroller for us to use when traveling by car and on the subway.I also needed a stroller with brakes placed in such a way the stroller can be bumped up and down a few steps with the baby in it so we can leave our NYC house without having to first take the stroller outside then the toddler.It is narrow in width but that's a matter of perspective and priority; I am thrilled with its narrow width because it's much more maneuverable through doors and store aisles or into restaurants.And of course doesn't take up so much room in the foyer.He's not snug in the seat, there's a bit of room still on the sides.This stroller is also less tippy than the Maclaren.I can hang a fair amount of weight on the handles and it won't tip backwards even when the our son isn't sitting in it.The basket is small and just a nylon fabric but I find I can still fit a carton of milk and a few groceries in it.It is so difficult to push it with two hands, imagine one?!Not the best in the market, make sure you review it well and even test drive it, if you have the option.I like our combi stroller, it had just about everything I expected for the price.It is a bit difficult to completely fold it if you only have one hand free.I use it mainly in the city and we walk a lot.At some point, around 17 months of age, her foot started to dangle below the foot rest and twice is got stuck near the wheel (ouch, nothing serious though!)I realize a lot of these umbrella strollers have the same type of feet rest.I agree with some of the reviewers that the canopy is not very flexible and that could have been better designed.The folding mechanism broke on it, but we did use it a lot.Very poor ride/manueverability.Pros:lightweightbellybarCons:Not built for medium/heavy useVERY poor manueverabilityfolding mechanism breaksThey require a bit of effort at first since sheet goes underneath,  but much easier than changing whole sheet.Now it takes less than a minute and there is no lifting involved!It's so great product for my baby's crib.I defenately recommand it.The quick zip sheets are awesome, *IF* you don't use a bumper or sheet protector.I have the breathable bumpers (love them) and a crib protector (it ties onto the rails) and it is difficult to reach around them and zip/unzip the sheet set.I plan to take off the bumpers soon, since my son is about the age to start climbing around, so this product is probably more useful for infants 6 months and older.Also, I'd like to note that if you use a mattress pad, you need to purchase the kind that doesn't have elastic to slip under the corners -- or if you have a late night accident to clean up, you'll still have to take off the entire sheet set in order to get the mattress pad off.As far as ordering different color top sheets, I have the base sheet and top sheet set in white, and a top sheet in sage: when the sage top sheet zips onto the white base, you can see the white on the sides between the crib rails, so you may want to go with matching colors.Personally, this look doesn't bother me and it goes with our nursery, but it's something to consider.This is not a bad cup.Handles are nice for little hands.When I started introducing sippy cups, my little guy was not (and is still not at 9mos) interested in tipping the cup up to drink from it.When visiting friends around 7mos he tried this cup out and LOVED it.True, with the straw he wasn't able to get a lot of water at first, but he quickly figured it out.His shirts still get fairly wet when he drinks from it, BUT he always chooses this over any of his other options at this point.Note: he only has bottom teeth and doesn't really chew on this, so I can't speak to the durability of the straw in that regard, but so far the product seems sturdy and reliable.It worked like a charm, from the first time I handed it to him he was drinking out of it independently.That is a lifesaver for a busy Mom.My son loves this cup, carrying it by the handles wherever he goes.however there are a lot of areas to clean on this one, including the straw pieces.i use my dr. brown bottle pipe cleaner thing to slide inside the straws when cleaning.teething children gnaw on everything, and the handles & lid are NOT BPA free.my child started to chew on the handles and actually bit one of the rubber nubs off [i luckily got it before he swallowed it].i have since put the handle cups away for after the "everything goes in my mouth" phase.as for the drinking aspect of the cup, it isn't difficult to use.i started using these around 9 months and he had no problem.the straw uses compression to allow the liquid to come out, it also prevents it from spilling when not being used.when reassembling, make sure you put the clear straw into the lid first, pull it until you hear a slight pop, and make sure it is over the hole.then push the white hard straw into the clear straw.it won't leak if you do it correctly.overall, these cups are great if you are tired of helping your child lift up the sippy cup.the cleaning of them is just part of enjoying a product that let's your child drink independently.Our infant daughter has been using these cups for a few months now, it is the design she reaches for over the other brands/styles we have.She figured out how to drink out of the straw in about 45 seconds, she was 6 months at the time.I like this cup (the handles, color and size) BUT cleaning and putting the straw back into the top is annoying because it wont go pass the slide bar.You have to insert a butter knife or something to get it through.The straw does leak sometimes by liquid coming up the straw and can get spilled out.Also it can get expensive to replace the straws because you can only get it with another hard top with the slide bar.The only two straw cups I have liked (but they don't have handles) is the munchkin mighty grip straw cup and the playtex twist and click insulator straw cup.The munchkin one can sometimes have liquid rise up the straw but the playtex I have had no problem.The inside of the cup is clean, but if you look through the bottom of the cup you can see residue stuck between the layers of plastic (this is hard to explain).These bottles function well, but they only hold 7 ounces (not an issue for me right now).I purchased 4 Dr. Brown's Natural Flow glass bottle systems because my husband and I don't want to expose our little girl to toxins in plastic bottles which diffuse into breast milk.The source of the smell was the neoprene-like insert to be installed inside the bottle.The neoprene gives off a strong chemical smell that would be in direct contact with my baby's milk and diffuse into the milk.He would not confirm or deny that chemicals in the neoprene would diffuse into the milk and tried to reassure us by saying that the material was food grade and FDA-approved.We are not reassured.The plastic bottles with BPA are still being used as FDA-approved containers.Just because it is food grade or FDA-approved does not mean it is toxin-free.Be careful of greenwashing - the selective display of a virtuous attribute of a product meant to impart goodness on the whole thing.Please add a thread if you find a bottle system that doesn't smell like a plastics factory - we are still looking and our baby will be born in December.Because the whole padding is washable (well hand-washable anyway), because my daughter likes it, and because the company replaced it when the insurance company wouldn't.When I called the carseat company to verify this, they immediately offered to replace the seat with a brand new one.I was and still am flabbergasted.It is a big car seat, especially rear-facing, but it fit in our Mazda 6, and now in our Honda Odyssey.It has also spent time in my mother's Honda Pilot.Definitely buy a seat from this company.The forward facing weight limit is great at 65 lbs, and the seat has a 7 year lifespan as opposed to the typical 6 years of most car seats.An older baby does not need the full 45 degree recline, 35 degrees is fine, and this makes it easier to fit.Very few kids would outgrow this seat rear facing in height before weight.I only replaced it because I was not ready to turn him forward facing and he was getting close to the rear facing weight limit.The seat is naturally recline which i wanted vs. a booster which are much more upright so if he feel asleep he would not have the head flop problem common in boosters.Comes with an infant insert that is reversible (!!)for smaller babies and a head support too.We do use the pillow that can come off (hard to tell it has one in the pic but it does, it's super cushy).Love the cupholder though it does sit low and my son has a hard time getting cups in/out.I had diapers dot com price match amazon since their return service is better and overnight free shipping.LOVE the black gray combo, very sleek and hides stains and dirty pants from playing at the park!Wish i had never gotten a maxi cosi priori and just gotten this one from the start!This is the only seat I recommend to friends for the safest installation RFing.I have installed over 5 different types of car seats in 4 different vehicles and while a FFing seat is pretty easy to install, some of the RFing seats have brought me to tears, but not with this seat!The reason is the seat belt lock-offs that actually work!I can even install this seat properly all by myself with the vehicle's seat belt.(You might be thinking I'm some sort of idiot, but I'm not and if you are persnickety about safety like me, then you know that the seat must be installed well to be optimally safe.)I love it so much I bought another one for our 2nd vehicle.I've never used it with the headrest removed (b/c we used an infant carrier seat from newborn to 22lbs), but it fits our SUV (Nissan Murano) well with it on.It is very cushioned for the child's comfort and the shoulder fabric over the harness is nice.It has good side impact protection, yet is still easy for mom or dad to reach in to get baby in/out and buckled.I was able to go from lvl 2 to 3 when switching kids from the 1yr old to the 2yr old in an instant and then put it back again.My one and only dislike is that the lever release for the strap adjustment is a bit low and may be hard to reach RFing b/c it is on the vehicle's seat back.It is fine and operational for our SUV, and just a little tricky to reach in the truck (straight seat backs) so I have to reach my finger down on the side of it.My 1st child used this seat RFing til she was 2 and now her little sister is using it, so I've never used it FFing yet.The only seat I would compare it to is the Britax Boulevard, but this one has a much better price tag.But this is the only car seat currently on the market that got a 5-stars across the board (NHS), and the best crash ratings by independent testing.So this seat was a no-brainer for us.I will add that this one installs easiest of all the car seats we tried.I understand some negative reviews got frustrated with installation - but you *must* read the entire instruction booklet (it only took me 10-15 minutes the first time), and please realize this did install easiest of the six seats we tested.But I'm more concerned with *why* this is the only 5-star seat.This sounds good on the surface ... but this law actually encourages treating car seats like a disposable item & more cheap Chinese imports, and is driving down quality of all car seats (including Britax).If people have to buy new car seats every few years, & can't use the same car seat for multiple children or even the same child for more than a few years, then car seats become a "disposable" item.If it doesn't represent a long term investment, the result is cheaper manufacturing.The result is, every seat we looked at is a cheap Chinese import.High quality is the best standard (not age) - why not have standards for QUALITY and SAFETY instead of just going by shelf date?The DISPOSABLE Car Seat Laws are bad for everyone *except* big corporations, China, and greedy politicians willing to personally profit from lower safety standards.Theoretically, a person could be legally prohibited from buying the safest car seat.And it could earn you a ticket or higher insurance rates in several states.But I'm glad there's at least one car seat with a good rating.As a final note, your price point for this should be around $150.I wanted to get something that had good ratings and something he wouldn't grow out of in the near future.It arrived quickly, packaged well and I loved loved how soft and padded it was.The material is very soft and plush.Rear facing Pros:1.There is NO WAY this would fit in a car, especially with the head rest attached.2.Tightening the shoulder straps was near impossible because the tightner is at the front of the seat, thus wedged between the car seat and baby seat.Forward Facing Pros:1.Can fit in either center seat or side seat.2.Easily adjust the shoulder straps4.It's so big that it doesn't leave a lot of leg room for child in smaller cars.I love the safety ratings this got and the price was great.It is just a little too large for any/all car seat travel bags that I researched out there.Our only option would have been to check it in a garbage bag or take it on the flight (which we wanted to do anyway).It is approved on flights, though very hard to carry down the aisle because of it's size and weight.Also, you can not use the seats belt locking mechanism in an airline seat, which isn't a big deal, because the airline buckle gets in the way.We purchased this car seat on a recommendation from a friend for our second car.This car seat blows the Safety 1st out of the water!This one is super easy to adjust without removing the seat from the car, the multi padding helps to get a tailored fit.Hands down the best convertible car seat out there!Don't waste your money on anything else.The reason we chose this car seat over other well-rated ones is because you can remove the cover to launder it without having to uninstall the entire seat (most car seats don't let you do this).The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it's quite a bear to install.It took twice as long as the Cosco Scenera which is in our other car, the instructions are a bit confusing, and we needed to roll up towels under it to have it be level.When you have to change the straps as your child grows, that too is really difficult.It doesn't look as bulky and ugly as the others and there were different color options to match your car interior!She appears to like it and thinks it is comfortable because she never has a problem falling asleep in it.My daughter transitioned well between her infant carrier and this car seat.Seems to clean up well and it appears that the cover detaches to wash, although I have not tried it yet.The sides don't block the child's view from looking out the window either.It is a bit big but fit in our '87 Mercedes and all the other vehicles we've had it in: no problem in the Ford extended cab, or the Lexus, or the Suburban, or the Highlander.I did have to put a rolled up towel under the base, but that is no problem.It is a wonderfull carseat!I bought this car seat for the reviews and after days of studying the best convertible seats out there this was it!there is so much cushion.I haven't put it in yet so after I do I will add to this review.But I'm afraid my son is going to want to sleep in this more than his bed :).The only downside so far was that it was not machine washable which sucks.I'm used to it though b/c I buy a ton of organic toys!I wish the speaker was on the front so when it's on the ground you can still hear it.Other than that, I love the music (not annoying) and baby loves the music and the lights.It's only $8 at Target though- $21 is ridiculous.Everything the previous reviewers have said is exactly the case...He will watch it for quite some time.He can't hold it himself yet, so I don't know how long it will keep him entertained on his own.The sound quality is very nice--not irritating at all.Fun toy, not annoying to adults.Small enough to take with you and put in the diaper bag too.This toy can in fact be a life saver.It will keep the attention of any child for at least some length of time and can be used to shock them out of a fit.It has two setting for loudness so you can lower or raise it as need be which works well for when they are little and blasting it into their face at full volume might be scary.It also has a light display so it's kinda like baby laser Led Zeppelin with Mozart.The button is big enough that even an infant could hit it by flailing around a little.Every baby should have one.In fact every hospital should give one out along with the blankets and hats.I bought this toy for my daughter when she was about 2 months old.Now at nearly 9 months it is still a favorite toy, and my go-to toy when she's fussing and I want to distract her.I bought this when i was still pregnant because i love all things Baby Einstein.Now, he stares at it like he is mesmerized.I thought it looked so simple and uninteresting.Color me wrong.My daughter loves this thing.I couldn't have predicted how much she would like it.She is now 9 months old, and still likes it very much.I could always could on this toy to keep her happy.It would stop a crying fit almost every time.You just press the whole button and it cycles through the songs.Don't try to press the different sides of the circle- it doesn't work that way.This toy seems so simple, but I think there is something about it that really appeals to infants.I like this toy very much.I also like the fact that the sound quality for a toy is pretty good and the music it plays are favorite classical pieces.The songs also last longer than 5 seconds, which is nice.The only reason I didn't give it a full five stars is the fact that when it's laying flat on the floor (display-side up), the music is muffled because the speaker is on the back of it.So it has to be hanging somewhere or your baby has to hold onto it.Overall though, this is a great toy.I took it to a mom-and-baby group recently and all of the older babies were fighting over it.That was too early I think, cuz his arms were not that srong and sometimes he hit his head with it.The worst thing is that sound comes from the back and when the toy is on the floor (we have carpet) u can barely hear it.Overall that's a good musical toyWe carry this in our diaper bag all the time for car rides.When our 6 month old starts getting fussy, I whip this out and it entertains him until we get to where we're going or it soothes him to sleep.We started using this when he was 2 or 3 months old for that purpose too.Now that he can grab, he likes to push the button himself and chew on the sides.My baby girl likes this toy.My little girl loves her Takealong tunes.Also they don't have that tinny, annoying synthesizer sound that can be so annoying.It is a great way to keep her busy.Also it plays classical music which is a bonus.One of the best toys I have ever bought.We gave it to her when she was 6 months and she still loves it.My little one likes the tunes.It's small and easy to toss in the diaper bag.Amazon had the best price and because I ordered with a couple of other things I got free shipping!I don't know if its the music, the blinking lights, or a combination of both, but he cannot put this toy down.He seems to want to shake it a lot (too bad it doesn't have the iPod shuffle when shake feature ;), and he likes to bite the handle (currently teething).All in all a great toy.Someone gave us this little musical toy when my baby was born.I'm usually not a fan of Baby Einstein and plastic toys that make noise, but she really enjoys the music.I would recommend it without hesitation for infants!I don't think my baby likes that either.I'm thinking about putting duct tape over the lights.The handle is easy for his hand, but the button is way too hard to press.This is a great little toy for under $10.It is easy for baby to hold now that they are getting older and they occassionally manage to turn it on themselves.We have it hanging from their play mat now but I can definitely see it being a toy that they will hold and play with themselves here in the next few months.It would also be great to throw in a diaper bag.Highly recommend this little toy!This is always in the diaper bag.This is an overall good toy, one of her favorite.Well worth the money!A few considerations if you are thinking about buying it:#made of hard plastic so baby bangs it against own head (happens to my daughter all the time)#easy buttun to push intentionally or unintentionally (can be great with an infant who kicks around, but don't use  in crib when sleeping)#music plays for about 30 seconds, then it stops (so you must keep pushing it if she can't)#great sound quality (never annoying)#excellent battery life#large, hard, colorful plastic handle (difficult for infant under 5 months to grip)This is my go-to toy for shopping and doctor's waiting rooms.It isn't too loud even on the louder setting and it's easy to clip to a stroller or shopping cart with linkadoos.Easy for baby to push to activate and handle.This toy has been durable so far, and I'm sure will be a favorite for many more play times!however, i never let baby play with it without close supervision as the toy is very hard plastic and a little on the heavy side for its size.would have been nicer if it had a softer rubbery casing around it.But it does distract him in the car--briefly.I do like the tunes--maybe more than he does!This toy interested my 3 month old baby from the start with the lights and the music.Its size is convenient to pack in the diaper bag.He gets fussy at times in his stroller, but as soon as I press the button and the music starts playing, he stops fussing to listen to the music.This toy will work from the day your baby is born till at least his first year.It will mesmerize him all the time, great toy to hold off the baby cry, I recommended it a lot a lot a lot.Very cute and easy for your infant to play with.Not to loud on the music level like some toys.Cute and easy to take along with you or strp to the stroller , etc..She presses the buttons without realizing what she is doing but she is entertained.We keep this in our car seat.We bought the little toys that strap on to the handle of the carseat and was able to strap this on there as well.We use this everytime we are out and the batteries are still good.It has a switch so you can turn it on low or high, we keep it on high since we use it when we are out.Yes, another item I purchased for my 3 month old because of the high reviews on Amazon.com.Baby figured out very quickly how to hit the button to make the sounds and she gets all excited when the music is playing and the lights are going off!There are very few toys that are appropriate for children of all ages."Take Along Tunes" is one of those toys - as a newborn our daughter was fascinated by the blinking lights, but now that she is 8 months she loves the music - and the fact the handle works for a teether.Our niece is 13 months and she loved the "Take Along Tunes" - it was the perfect size for her hand... and she literally likes to walk around with it in her hand!Pros-- Great for all (young ages)- Nice variety of classical tunes- Two volumes- Batteries last a long time- Colored blinking lights- The handle makes a decent teething ringFinal Verdict - For the price you can not go wrong with "Take Along Tunes" - highly recommended for al parents and daycare providers.5 StarsMy son (now 7 months) enjoys it and I certainly got my money's worth.As others mentioned, the sound is clear and not annoying.It's east to take along in a diaper bag and the handle allows you to attach it to car seats, exersaucers or whatver with a toy attacher.I can't get over how cheap it was for the quality of the product.It also has two volume levels as well.It's definitly a baby toy, but older kids are amused by it too.my daughter loves this toy, but I am very concerned that this was manufactured with toxic plastics (e.g., BPAs).Given she's inevitably going to have her mouth all over this toy, the materials are very important.I've tried calling Baby Einstein, and they were very dodgy in response and forwarded me to Kids II.Kids II has yet to respond to my query about what materials went into the manufacture of this product or are being ingested by my daughter.I worry that this is an unsafe toy, but am unclear what to do now that I have it because there is a clear mark to not throw in ordinary garbage on the back of this device - so if it's not safe for the trash can, how is it safe for my child?Until I get answers, it's on a shelf where it can't harm a kid.We call this the 'baby hypnotizer' -- it is the only thing that calms our baby when he really gets crying.It is actually wierd; we just turn it on, and he stops crying and stares at the lights.It's funny, she puts it under her foot in the carseat and plays the music with her heel, while still holding her two best friends, Mortimer the Moose and Bear.Many of them end up in the corner of his playpen after he's grown tired of them 5 minutes in.This toy is different - he will play with this for a long time - it really keeps his attention.And the music is nice - not annoying like so many toys can be.Up until recently we'd been using our infant soothies, but needed to really move on to a pacifier for older babies.They're great because they don't stick to the face causing a huge rash when the baby is teething.The Avent blows away the MAM, the Avent is much softer.I also like that the Avent is crystal clear (so you can see if there's any gunk hidden inside the bulb) and super easy to clean.I also love that it has the little handle to connect a strap to it.Wish I had gotten them earlier on instead of wasting money on the other straps that now just sit in a drawer.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Y3BGYE/ref=oss_productI was looking for a bag for short trips to the mall or grocery store with my newborn, and this bag works great.For longer trips, I would recommend a bigger bag.My favorite feature is the stroller clips; I wish every diaper bag would come with these!If this is your first, it may be enough, but with two kids I'm going to need something bigger.I got this on sale super cheap (otherwise I wouldn't have purchased it), so I didn't judge its shortcomings as harshly as I might have had I paid full price.The little straps that allow it to attach to the handle bars of the stroller are fantastic and the only reason that I use this bag as much as I do.Now, this isn't a bag I could use to take to the daycare everyday with all the accutrements required for such a trip.Like others have said, this bag may have pockets gallore, but you can only use a few at a time.There is no way this would hold 4 bottles, 2 outfits, various medicines and creams, and all the other myriad things I pack in my big bag each day.Initially, my thought was that I would never use this bag for that very reason.But for trips to the mall, out to eat, or just to run an errand or two, this bag does the job.I rarely carry the bag on my shoulder so I can't speak to the comfort or ease of carrying (and you can't fill it very full, so I don't know how comfortable it would be if it was heavy with "stuff").I have also never used the changing pad that came with it (I have my own that I use).Bottom line:  don't pay full price for this bag if you intend to feel like you're getting your money's worth.I've had my share of diaper bags and this one is great especially if you prefer to wear your bags crossbody and want to do so without taking out a whole row of clothes on the rack in the store.If my crossbody bags are too bulky, I'll create a whole new aisle in the store by knocking everything down!The great thing about this whole line of bags is that you can attach it to the stroller or shopping cart with the clips on the sides of the bag.There's plenty of organization including a handy zippered pocket for valuables that you can keep at a secured, quick reach.Although the Skip Hop Dash Deluxe has not worked for me in the past, I was very attracted to the gorgeous Pop Flower print.The colors are subdued as well, not too busy (muted olive-toned greens, blues, grey-lavender).However, although the bag has a pretty exterior, the overall quality was disappointing.The interior is a very light blue (almost light gray) cheap nylon material, nothing special.The flap has some sort of cardboard insert and it makes a cardboard-type crinkling sound when you open and close the bag.You definitely will not mistake the fabric for cotton or any natural fiber.It's a gorgeous bag to be sure, but overall, it's mediocre/average quality in terms of materials.Nothing like the original Skip Hop Dashes (from the 2005-2007 era).A nice purchase if you are looking for a pretty bag with good organization, but be prepared for cheap fabric, annoying cardboard noises, and very weak magnets.I purchased the bag for my Quinny stroller.Fit's perfectly on the handle bar-Lot's of space-great quality.Personally I love any baby Einstein products.My son stays engaged with this toy and the light always gets him to stops crying.We have had this for over a year with no problems.My daughter's pee goes straight down in the bowl area.I've never had a problem with pee collecting under the seat, and since she doesn't pee on the seat, so far no pee has soaked into the seat.I guess if you pee all over the seat, that could happen!The seat is super comfy (looks to be, that is!).That's why I picked this one.My daughter uses her potty, then closes the lid, steps up to the sink, and washes her hands right away.Love it.I am able to empty with minimal problems.The few times my daughter tried to empty it herself she spilled some, probably the same with any training potty.We clean it with bleach wipes and so far no odors, no foam degrading.I often let the bowl and seat dry out separately overnight in the bathtub after cleaning, so it gets good and dried out.Most other potties seem to assume that all toddlers have penises and need a splash guard.!The only downside is my daughter is very tall for her age, and she's now outgrowing it.I came online just now to find a seat that will fit on the grownup potty, only to find out that all have mixed reviews and are overpriced.Check it out at a local retailer if you're unsure.This was not the potty I wanted because of the reviews I read, but it was given to me as a gift so we took it and have definitely used it!At 16 months, my daughter needed some lifting to get her positioned right.Others are right in that the urine will go down under the cushion and I agree that it doesn't dump very easily (I try to always dump it from the same side so my hands are less likely to get gross).I like the comfty cushion and that's it.It's cumbersome to put the pieces back together; pan, rim & cushion must line up just right.The catch bin is big and when you empty it, the contents tend to spill out of the rim.When she drags it to the counter, it often comes apart and she can't get it back together because the three pieces have to line up.In the other bathroom, we have a painted wooden chair type with a cut out hole.The bin has a handle attached and it slides underneath the hole.We like that a lot better, and so does she.Granted, I don't like her sitting on wood.But this one, the comfty cushion is going to be donated.If I could give this diaper bag a hundred stars, I would.It is absolutely everything I have ever wanted in a diaper bag, and as my husband can attest, I have tried just about every diaper bag on the market!Think of anything and everything you are looking for in a diaper bag, I guarantee you this bag has it and more!Skip Hop has thought of every contingency and has put together a diaper bag for every parent.It is roomy but not bulky...Right now, in my diaper bag, I have 6 size three diapers, a formula dispenser, Boogie Wipes, mittens, a snack container that will hold six ounces of his puffs, the Skip Hop Wipes container, my iPad, all of my sons medicines (which include Vicks baby rub, nose drops, baby Tylenol, baby Oragel, tummy soother, and a baby vitamin), two pacifiers, baby nail clippers, diaper rash ointment, hand sanitizer, the included changing pad, my things (including lip balms, meds and keys) Sophie the Giraffe, and my big Paul Frank blanket.It's got a cell phone pocket on the side, and a mesh bottle or 20 ounce Coke holder for mom or dad as well.The design is super cute and makes me feel like I have a bit of my own personality still and am not just mom with a frumpy diaper bag.With this bag, I don't need to carry a purse, which makes travel and going through stores so much easier.I've never had the shoulder strap slip down my arm either, something a lot of other diaper bags do, which makes it annoying to hold your diaper bag and a baby and push a stroller all at the same time.This also has a convenient clip, which makes attaching to your stroller a cinch!I've had so much trouble with past diaper bags hanging too low, or with most of the JuJuBe bags (I had the JuJuBe BeAll) you have to buy an additional accessory to be able to clip it onto your stroller.I wish that I had bought this diaper bag right from the get-go, because I would have saved myself SO much money in diaper bags and saved myself the headache of carrying three bags around the stores.I adore this bag and would recommend it to any parent!First one needed ot be returned because of some bad stitching on an internal pocket but new one has had no problems.Whole family likes itUpdate 2/21/2011: After the stitching came undone on an interior pocket, we got a replacement.Two  months later we've got the same problem--looks like poor quality and stitching.4 star to 2 star.Contacted support and will update once I hear backUpdate 3/15/2011: Contacted support and got replacement bag.Unsure if quality is still an issue because it looks ok before use but so didn't the last one.I'd add one star but I consider this a product review not a service review so this stays at 2 stars.Glad to know their service is responsive and right on though.I like this bag a lot.Great diaper bag!I bought it to use as a diaper bag for when I am running errands, etc.It is made really well and with high quality materialsThis is bag is cute but it is not worth the headache.Also - it falls over all the time since you cannot fill up the middle.I would suggest Peutina Pickle Bottom (pricy) or a JJ Cole....you can at least use the main part of the bag.I want to start off by saying I only have one 6 month old baby and have only used this diaper bag so I don't have anything to compare it to, but so far this is a great diaper bag for my needs.It holds quite a bit without being outrageously bulky.I have the Uptown Stripe and the pattern is really cute.It's not as bright as it looks in pics, which I think is good.The fabric is very sturdy too--I have no doubt this will last just fine with no holes.That can be good when you're trying to overstuff it and want to let stuff poke out the top, but it's not so great if you do tip it upside down because things can fall out!My husband likes it because he can carry the bag without it looking like a diaper bag.I put this on my registry based on its great reviews and a recommendation from a friend but now I wish I had seen it in person first because I've never really been happy with the design.This is a great quality diaper bag, it doesn't fray and isn't showing any signs of wear despite my son being almost a year old.But the design of this bag kind of stinks.It's tall and narrow so it falls over when I set it down and it's not nearly big enough for a few diapers, a change of clothes, and a toy or two.I can't ever find anything inside it, my wallet will sink to the bottom while I'm out shopping, never to be seen again (till I get home and dump the entire thing out).It also kind of swings awkwardly at my side.It's not flat like a messenger bag but since it's usually overstuffed and there isn't a strong closure (just a magnet) I don't feel comfortable flipping it over my back where anyone could reach inside.I will probably sell this at a consignment shop and get a different bag for my next kid.That said, I have passively been looking for a replacement and most of what I see in stores feels cheap so I continue to use (and dislike) it.Well made bag, just a dumb design.I think there are nicer ones by this maker.I have this bag and do not like it at all.It's so frustrating!It's also hard to fit larger items like toys or snack coolers.Bottles don't have their own place to go.The two side pockets are too small to put anything useful in.The top zipper pockets fill easily and block the opening of the bag.The magnet snaps fall open easily if the bag is turned upside down.The bag is ok for quick trips to the store or park, but I wouldn't bring it along for a day trips or multiple errands.I've had my share of diaper bags and this one is great especially if you prefer to wear your bags crossbody and want to do so without taking out a whole row of clothes on the rack in the store.If my crossbody bags are too bulky, I'll create a whole new aisle in the store by knocking everything down!The great thing about this whole line of bags is that you can attach it to the stroller or shopping cart with the clips on the sides of the bag.There's plenty of organization including a handy zippered pocket for valuables that you can keep at a secured, quick reach.I havent started using this diaper bag yet as I am still a month from my due date, but I already like it better then the one I used with my first child.I was having a very hard time finding a diaper bag I loved, or even liked!I have two diaper bags I was using for my 10 month old that wore out and were either too big or small... just did not make me happy!I love the cell phone bocket, the bottle/cup pouch.I always have a bib and a couple of cloth diapers in the bottom.It has plenty of spaces for me to organize my own stuff (chap stick, wallet, keys, pen, etc).I really love it... and it keeps me organized, so I waste less time digging to find my stuff.I can just hook the diaper bag on the bag handles.Not to mention how cute I think it is!First, to put my review in context, I am a new mom (my baby is now 6 months old, so I've been using the bag for 6 months).I use this bag both as a diaper bag and to carry my essentials.The way I have the bag set up is as follows: the front two pockets I use for some random little stuff, but nothing too valuable because they are easily accessible.With that, this bag is PACKED.Notice there are NO toys, books, bottles, snacks, etc.I registered for this bag (and received it as a gift for my baby shower) based on it's stellar reviews.My experience however has been much more similar to the 3, 2 and 1 star reviews I've read on here.The great things about this bag are that it doesn't feel huge and bulky to carry around, it's nice looking, my husband doesn't mind carrying it, the material is strong and durable, and those shuttle clips are fabulous.I am always struggling to jam things in, or digging to get something out without turning the whole bag upside down.When my husband puts something into the bag, he just wads it and stuffs it in there.So for a bag that we both use, it's frustrating when I go back to it and have to carefully re-fold everything to utterly maximize the space.I found this to be a huge disappointment as I HATE having to fumble with stuff, especially when I'm out in a store or restaurant.If you plan to carry your wallet in this bag, be very careful.The same thing applies to cameras/memory cards.I carry a small digital camera with me just in case something cute happens, and I worry every time I take it in and out of the bag.Finally, last night I compared what was in my bag to what my sister carries in her JJ Cole bag (she is a mommy of 4).She had multiple changes of clothes, 15 diapers, snacks, toys, jackets, etc.I am definitely considering a new bag in the near future.I really like Skip Hops designs and features, but I am also considering the JJ Cole bag my sister has.It is of very good quality though for a cotton toy.This is the only high chair that my husband and I have used for our 18-month-old daughter.The few inch gap between the table and the edge of the chair means that loads of food falls on the floor at every meal.Super gross.Worst of all, the frame part that locks onto the table will no longer unlock!Even my (quite strong) husband cannot get this thing off the table.When we recently moved to a new home, we actually had to move with the stupid hippo chair still attached to the table.Like I said, we are still using the thing, but it's more because we can't get it off the table than any other reason.If you were only to use it now and then while on the go (and if you could get it off the table again), then it might be worth considering this.But it is a real headache of a high chair if you want to use it for daily use.It may be durable and space-saving, but the extra mess and work created is really not worth it.We were able to use it when he was 5 1/2 months old, when he was first able to sit up on his own.Our son likes being able to sit at the table with us at dinner.It installs easily, is very secure (we were actually surprised how stable it is), and the cover comes off and is machine washable.It folds up flat for travel.Downsides -- I wish it had a wipeable surface for daily cleaning.The space between the chair and the table means more toys and food on the floor.We hook the handled end up to his booster seat instead of his wrist.I have gotten so many uses out of this and it still looks brand new- and that says a lot!Good purchase!My daughters cup avoided hitting nasty floors about a dozen times in just one day of use!When I first opened the cubes up, I noticed they were dirty and desperately needed washing.The cube lids do not stay on all the way either.Even if you don't overfill the cubes as the instructions say, the lids still do not seal all the way and there is a gap that food could spill out of (if it was in the fridge).I had trouble with the lids completely popping open too and had to put Scotch tape on them to keep them closed.The cubes also do not stay on the white tray and tip over and fall off very easily.I think you are better off buying the Fresh Baby trays.These are very high-quality trays, where the thick rubber lid stays on and the frozen food pops right out for storage in a zip-lock bag (just like regular ice cubes).Don't waste your money on these flimsy individual cubes!these are very handy for freezing and measuring snacks however the lids break easily.You can't put them in the microwave to unthaw.Useless.These are a great idea but they don't stay closed.The 2-ounce containers from Baby Cubes have a slightly different lid and they don't pop open as much, so I would buy those if you're looking at this product.I take a 2-ounce container of veggies out of my freezer before bed, it defrosts in the fridge over night and I serve my baby out of it for a day or two until it's gone (scooping out a serving and putting it on his plate of course, not spooning directly out of the container).Works great, but the 1-ounce, as I said, they don't stay closed.This bag is definitely high quality and very practical I think.I know people think it is a little narrow, but it is again so much more practical that way when is it hanging on the stroller and it is plenty big for my baby's needs.UPDATE:  Okay, after a few months of use, I thought I should review again.This bag is fraying around the edges, and I alternate with another bag, so this one doesn't even get much use.: (  Now, I am in the market for another bag.There simply isn't enough room!I consider myself a conservative carrier (I carry what we'll need and a few other things for 'just in case' situations) and it is not big enough for me.No one bag has yet to encompass all the best things about a diaper bag - roomy, lotsa pockets, stroller straps, attractive, padded shoulder strap, etc.You will have to compromise on something, I just couldn't compromise on room.I absolutely love this diaper bag!When I searched for a diaper bag, I wanted to make sure it didn't have a baby print on it such as baby animals, etc.I do not use the bottle bag since I'll be breastfeeding but having it available is great for the future if I need to use it.I have twins and fit all the stuff I need for them into the bag and still have some room left - four outfits, 4 pacifiers, 6 newborn diapers, etc.I also purchased the stroller straps for the bag and also like them as well!Great product to get baby to latch back on after refusing.And when you are so sore during the first couple weeks.It looks good and is the perfect size for the crib and hopefully it will be very helpful in the future with any nightly baby messes.I ordered it thinking it was a fitted crib pad, which it is not.But it still works fine under a fitted sheet and fits the crib well.I really love this car seat.We got it when he was about 8 months.You just move them up and down.Most car seats you would have to take the straps apart.Which makes baby able to see outside.I can only compare this to the Chicco infant seat, as we don't have any other experience with a convertible car seat.I think its kind of ugly, but I also find most carseat fabric ugly, too.The knobs are not difficult to understand, but occasionally they are difficult to maneuver, as if they get stuck a little bit.We brought our daughter home from the hospital in it, with her weighing just over 6 lbs.The infant head support did a sufficiently good job of supporting her neck until she was able to develop muscles on her own.Plan on taking some time to read the owner's manual and going through the pages with the seat in front of you.While you *could* just clip the seat into your car/truck/suv without possible problems, there are many tips and suggestions in the manual that made the process easier.Without the manual, I would have been cursing and tempted to take the seat back.Adjusting the seat to a tiny baby facing backwards was not difficult but did take a few steps.This is not a negative in my opinion.I have to brace myself with my knee on the seat, lift up the seat with one hand to release the pressure and then push down hard on the lever with the other hand.Again, this is not entirely bad as it is reassuring that the belts will not slip but the mechanism could be a bit easier.So far, we have only used this seat in the infant, rear-facing position.It is heavy.It is not a seat that you want to buy for daily swaps between vehicles.It was not difficult at all to remove the seat cover and then to put everything back together.I was very impressed with how intuitive it was to "reassemble" the seat.We would definitely buy this seat again, especially since Consumer Reports listed it again on their top convertible list.Edit:  We are still using this same seat for our DD who is now over one.We have removed the infant head support are just using the seat with the basic cover.Now, this seat is not one to switch between vehicles as it is heavy, but that has not been an issue for us.We have another for my car and replaced the cheapie Cosco Scenera in my husbands car for this because he is now driving with him more and because the weight limit is so much higher on this than most other convertible seats.Like others have said, this carseat is quite large (wide) but we only have one child so this isn't a factor for us.Initially I got the first seat because of the awesome feedbacks and ratings that were equal to the costly Britax.We do have problems with the straps twisting every once in a while but it's an quick and easy fix.My son loves his seat so much that before we put this new one in the car it sat in our living room and served as his 'easy chair' for a few days because he didn't want to part with it!The first one arrived at an earlier time than scheduled, but had some parts defected(two parts didn't sound and light even when I put the appropriate batteries).So I returned it, and asked for a replacement.Amazon.com was great!They sent another one quickly and even without additional charges for Saturday delievery.My wife and I am totally satisfied with the company's service.My four months old baby really loves it, and is enjoying while I'm writing this review.These things:  Worth It.Also, your child can grow with this exersaucer... the bottom legs can be adjusted to the correct height as he/she gets taller.If I had to buy this outright, now having had one, I would.It is fun to watch your baby's little wheels turning in his/her head as they try to figure out what to do with all of the brightly colored gadgets.It has a nice variety of toys and we love the fact that you can switch them out!The few times we've had spit-ups or accidents, it was pretty easy to clean up.Our son could sit in this easily for 20-30 minutes which is great because it gave me time to get some things down around the house.I do like the electronic toys, but it takes a lot of batteries.They were so occupied by it that sometimes they fall asleep there - and I have to move them to their beds.They developed plagiocephaly (flat head) at about 8 weeks.I can't hold them all the time, and since they didn't sit up by themselves yet, I couldn't just leave them anywhere.It's also been moved around and we've had no problems with it.He weighs 20lbs 15oz and is somewhere around 28 inches tall.We started off with a fisher price jumperoo.Our son really loved to jump around in it but it lacked toys.One of the three springs was also faulty and so we have mailed it off to Fisher Price for a refund.We purchased this exersaucer as a replacement for several reasons.The first being that it could be used for a longer period of time; our jumperoo was already at the 2nd setting and our son was getting close to maxing out the weight limit.After setting up the exersaucer the boy is already at the highest setting so it looks like it won't be useable for that long either.The second reason we purchased this was the extensive amount of toys.After setting it up it looks like there might actually be too much stuff on here.The objects that you can pull down on to make noise are mostly smooth plastic with no handles.Our son gets a hold of them but I don't know why they didn't make them easier to grab.This toy does not bounce, especially not like a jumperoo.The jumperoo, while it has less stuff, had a single on/off switch and volume control.It also made noise when the baby jumped, not just when he interacted with something.The exersaucer is loud!Some of the toys are unsettling.I accidentally hit the car toy in the middle of the night and the disturbing laughing children was creepy.When you add in the fact that this thing feels like it might tip over with a good bump (we have a 160lb newfoundland  who is clumsy) we will be exchanging this for another jumperoo.The newer jumperoo has plenty of stuff on it and since it was the same base as our old jumperoo, we know that it will be more stable.We liked this one b/c she loves to stand, and this one was low enough that she could stand in it.As she's gotten taller, and loves to jump around in it.There are plenty of toys, so she doesn't get board quickly.There is also a little room to set other toys to keep her standing and entertained.I'll admit I have only had this car seat (the DLX model) for a few days.But it replaced my First Years True Fit, which I got rid of after a minor car accident.This seat is 1000 times better and fixed every problem I had with the True FitThe True Fit never felt stable, was hard to get on, was hard to adjust, sat up too straight, and was hard to install.It worked so smoothly then.But now, ugh, it's beginning to be a nightmare.My daughter is only 26 pounds at 2 1/2 so she is still rear-facing.The tightening knob is a major hand workout to get tightened down properly now.It seems to slip a little even after it has been tightened which worries me.To loosen the straps, I have to push with all I've got and yank hard on the straps.Her head slumps to a weird forwards angle when she falls asleep, so those big side wings are useless for sleep comfort.I have one of those neckroll things for her but it doesn't seem to help.She has been able to free her upper body from the harness twice while I was driving down the highway by pushing the chest clip down after I had tightened it really well.My daughter loves Earth's Best rice cereal, and these packets, while a bit pricier than the big box of cereal, is very convenient for travel.WARNING: Watch out for the expiration date on your cereal packets.I received mine in late September, and they expired Oct 27th.I had no problem using them up in a month, but I was very disappointed that I was being forced to use them so quickly.I bought this carseat based on its high ratings from Consumer Reports.I was afraid that it would be a little too big for my car (Toyota Corolla) but fits just fine rear-facing.I'm sure it will fit even better once it's forward-facing.The seat seems super comfy--very nice padding and my son seems very happy in it (he's been less fussy on car rides).Getting him in and out of the seat is a snap.This is a great carseat for a low price!This car seat is as great as Britax and not as expensive as Britax.We use this car seat occasionaly and we have not had any problem installing it in the car.Unlike other convertible car seats, it can handle up to 50 lbs so you do not need to by another car seat until your child is old enough to use a booster seat.I would recommend it to my friends.I have a Britax Marathon for my car, but we needed a second seat for my husband's car.LATCH system isn't horrible but is definitely not as easy as the Marathon.Voila, they reach fine now.It wasn't hard to do, just good to know (when all else fails, read the manual, right?)It's harder to get the seat in as tight as the Marathon but only because pulling the strap tight is tougher.It just takes more muscle to pull it.Maybe that's just ours, but our strap seems almost a little sticky.We did it though, just not something I want to do all the time.If it's something you're going to take in and out a lot, a Britax might be worth the money, as it is easier to get good and tight.Comfort: My daughter seems to like this seat better than the Marathon.It is a little roomier and she just seems happier in it.Still though, Evenflo should include them, as I read other reviews complaining of this.We mainly got this seat because of the easy-as-pie tightening of the straps.My mom tends to get frustrated with car seats, so the knobs on the sides to tighten and loosen are genius for her.Pretty easy to get the baby in good and tight, and the harness says on it, "place at armpit level" so there doesn't leave much room for error.She has gotten frustrated with the Marathon before (I use the Marathon every day and even I get annoyed with that stupid HUG system (those rubber things over the straps).It seems I have to spend more time than I'd like adjusting them so they aren't poking into her neck, every time I put her in the seat).I'm not sure she'll like the installation of this seat though...I'm a little anal about car seat safety so I definitely have to make sure she can get the seat installed right or this will be going back, I don't care how cool those knob tighteners are :)Overall though, I think this is a good seat for the money.The Evenflo Triumph Advance in my opinion is one of the best convertible car seats available right now.The Evenflo is definitely more roomy, which I can see that he likes.So she will take the Roundabouts (rear-facing up to 35lbs) and our son will be in the Evenflos (we regularly drive two cars).We didn't purchase another set of Roundabouts because they only go up to 40lbs/40 inches and are, well, expensive.If you are considering the Triumph Advance, you are probably also considering the Graco Nautilus and the Britax Marathon.I skipped the Marathon because of price and skipped the Nautilus because it's made in China, cannot rear-face at all, is priced too high in my opinion, and lacks the awesome harness adjustability of the Triumph Advance (the 65lbs harness is awesome but the Nautilus only gives you two additional inches for height than the Triumph Advance--50 inches v. 52 inches (most kids outgrow seats by height not by weight)).Because of its tall shell, you will probably actually be able to use the Triumph Advance rear-facing until your child hits the 35lb limit (unlike the Roundabout, which most children outgrow by height long before hitting the 35lb rear-facing limit).Finally, car seats "expire."Car seats are largely plastic after all and years of hot summers and cold winters in an automobile will take a toll.And so will time spent in a warehouse.That's why the date of manufacture is one of the first things I check when I buy a car seat.Not only is this pacifier made in the USA, it is affordable, durable and adorable.I had such a good experience with this brand that I had to buy a bunch more.We have them all over the house now for whenever baby needs one.They do not smell like rubber like other pacifiers nor do they have parts that will come apart in the sink or dishwasher like others.When our daughter was first born we used this pacifier on occasion when she was fussy (the hospital gave it to us).This is the only pacifier she would take.It's easy to clean too!I exclusively breastfeed so I thought I would try these since they are supposed to be better for breastfed babies.But these fall out of my newborn's mouth constantly.He much prefers the MAM's and is able to keep them in his mouth longer.We'll be saving this "bink" for the next baby to see if he or she will like it.Unfortunately she loves it so much that it is difficult to have her nap without it, although she will go back to sleep after a night feed without it.They do fall out easily so there are many trips back to her crib to reinsert the gumdrop but that is the sacrafice I make for getting her to sleep in the first place.One piece means you never worry it might be a choking hazard and are VERY durable.They go through the diswasher often and show no signs of wear 18 months later.It took a lot of trial and error to find a pacifier that my daughter would take and she took the Soothies right away with no problems.I just found these and ordered them from the company's website since they have the same nipple as the Soothies.I bought these because all of the reviews were great and I was looking for something similar to the Soothie pacifier that my daughter got from the hospital since that's the only one she will take.I bought some Soothie pacifiers from the store but they are not the same as the one from the hospital because the nipples are not as soft.So, I went looking for something better and found these, which have nipples exactly like the Soothie from the hospital and she loves it.Great pacifiers, just wish the scent lasted longer.Definitely better than the soothies as these leave room for smaller babies noses & a spot for the pacifier holder.When we were there, they gave him a vanilla scented soothie.While I personally hate the soothie since it covers up their entire face, it was a save all!By the end of his visit he was asleep.For whatever reason he favors the blue over the orange, but loves them both.When he's super fussy, we give him these and he tends to calm down faster.My firstborn rejected pacifiers (we started him on Nuks) and I really wanted our new baby to have a way to self-soothe in the event that I can't nurse him at a moment's notice.I saw some great reviews for GumDrop pacifiers and decided to try the scented version.Our week-old infant has taken to the GumDrops since day one, without nipple confusion or any other adverse effects.They seem to comfort him immediately when I can't nurse him right away, and are the right size for his little newborn mouth.Definitely gives me a few moments of peace knowing that he's comforted in someone else's arms while I prepare to feed him, and I appreciate the fact that they are hospital grade.Yes my baby loved it, although it never fit on her car seat that well.But there is no way to turn it off without unscrewing the battery plate and taking out the battery.I finally removed the battery and put it away.We have logged over 5,000 miles with this toy bar in the car and surprisingly we still aren't sick of the music.When we were looking for a toy bar for our daughter's carseat we were looking for something that she could interact with that had easy listening characteristics.the only con for me was that i kept forgetting to switch the valve off, so it leaks a bit.but that was my own fault, and ultimately nothing that will stop me from using it for my third child.it really makes the whole poop on a cloth diaper thing MUCH easier to deal with.but the great thing about it is that you can adjust the spray so that once you get the hang of it you use the power when the stuff's being stubborn and sticking, and the gentler spray for when you don't want it splashing back up in your face!haha.you certainly learn quickly!and now that my second little guy is potty training it's handy for the messes he makes.overall i'm very happy with my purchase and only wish i had done the cloth diapering system with the first baby too.i would have had it mastered by the second one, but at least i'm totally prepared for the third.You can make your own for 1/2 the cost, literally.On YouTube there's a DIY video on how to make this, the most expensive part is the spray head kit that comes with the hose.It can run about $10.I don't have anything to turn on and off, I just use the spray head whenever I need it.I use a 3M hook on the side of the toilet to hang the head up on.There's lots of pressure and it DOES save time to have something along these lines for cloth diapering.Highly recommend either buying this or making your own if you're on a budget.She can grip the chunky handles steadily and use the utensils better than any I've seen her try so far, and I don't have to worry about safety.We have some plastic toddler spoons which are a better size for us.By the time baby's ready to eat, the frozen food has thawed (if not, I just stick the bowl in some hot water).Iadd formula to the cereal, and dinner is served.It's very convent for daycare, as well as for trips to Grandma and Grandpa's.The only problem is, you'll have to buy more spoons (the pack only comes with one).The First Years Take And Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 PieceWe purchased this for our 3 month old.It was easy for her to use at first and made sitting up for her easy to learn at such a young age.As she got bigger her little chunky legs would get stuck and you could not get her out.Good to use when they are 3-5 months old after that, not so much use at all.and the snugness didn't work for him - he has a "thing" about being constrained and that seems to include this chair.I also thought the back should be a little taller as his head seemed to flop a little too much when he'd occasionally lose control, but I also think he's a little taller than the average 3 month old.I thought the chair seemed like good quality and not too hard, though.I'd read somewhere else where someone mentioned a safety recall on this chair & warned people not to buy it.But I have to comment - the safety recall seems to be, to me, due to lack of common sense on parents' parts, not a flaw of the product.The recall is because people are doing both of these and children are tipping over the chair and being seriously injured from falling off of tables, etc.I bought the chair, anyway, a day after reading the review & the recall because it would never occur to me to put him on a table or leave him alone in the seat.I really like this bag.I had been eyeing it for awhile but didn't want to spend the money on yet another diaper bag.I had my second child recently and was having a hard time lugging the infant carrier, holding my 3 year old's hand AND a big shoulder bag....maneuvering through parking lots, stores, etc.was really a pain.I needed a backpack.So I decided to splurge and get it...there aren't many backpack diaper bags out there unfortunately.The ONLY thing I don't like about it are the magnetic closures on the front pockets...while they are great in theory, I can't store my car keys in there because I have a smart key (and I'd really like my keys to all by on the key clip).I also worry about my phone being stored in there.So far I've had no problems with the phone but I did have a problem with my smart key so can't store it there anymore.Overall, though, it wouldn't make me change my decision to purchase this bag - the pros far outweigh the cons.I love Ju-Ju-Be products and this was my first ever.I use Be Quicks and Be Sets to help organize this bag even more.You can go onto Ju-Ju-Be website to see more videos on the inside of these bags.I also love the smart magnets on this product.BUT my all time FAVORITE part is that I can wear this bag 3 different ways.Over the shoulder, messenger style, or backpack style.I use it backpack style many times going into stores or from the house to the car.If you are looking for a traditional backpack diaper bag I would recommend the Be Right Back or the BFF from JJB.If you want to learn more about JJB then you can also check out their website and look for the pink room.You can see lots of pictures of all the Ju Ju Be bags and how different ladies pack them up.I am going to warn you owning a Ju-Ju-Be is the start to a JJB addiction :) have fun!I made the mistake of putting one in the dryer and then forgot about it and it shrank 2 inches!!!The minky fabric is all matted and ugly, but baby doesnt seem to care, he still loves it.We have 4 Minky blankets total and the quality is great as long as you keep it out of the dryer!!They are expensive, but they are worth it.They stand up to washing and light drying (I partially dry, then hang dry the rest of the way).Our granddaughter is four months old and can't really hold things super well yet and I like the fact that the middle of this rattle she can grab on tight.Delivered fast and on time.(I ordered it between Thankgiving and Christmas)I like this rattle most of all because the delicate handles are easily gripped by even the smallest hands.This is the first rattle my daughter had and she began really enjoying it at about two months.It made the most noise (not loudest, but rather made noise with less effort).And the narrow twisted bar fit into his small hands easier when we placed it there.He was enjoying it by 2months old.However, he prefers other rattles now at 4months since he likes grasping the single bar.My babies have quite a few rattles and this is their favorite one.I have always hated the sound those phone rattles make and they are not as easy to hold onto.My babies also like chewing on the handle.Definitely recommend this over other rattles.this rattle was a gift, and i intend to buy it for gifts in the future.This is a great first toy.My son could wrap his little fingers around the skinny handles at a very early age.Now he's nine-months-old, and he still likes to shake this rattle.He has two, and he likes one in each hand.My daughter doesn't like these keys at all at first.The plastic is really hard and not very chewable and the keys are slightly heavier than you'd think they should be.They work, but seem cheaply made and are only surface clean (not dishwasher-safe).I got 2, & that seems to be plenty for us.Love them for putting over the car seat when in the car so the sun won't come in, but my little girl still has ventilation.They also pack small in the diaper bag and are light enough to drape over the car seat when outside between the car and inside destination to keep the sun off her face without smothering her.at birth) 17-day old baby.Muslin is the sack-cloth that dress forms are covered with and patterns are made with.It is not terribly soft and certainly does not stretch.I was so excited to get these, but have found little use for them, other than to dress up photos of baby.My 6mo old still needs to be swaddled when he has a hard time falling asleep, and these blankets can still do the job easily.We pretty much immediately abandoned all our other swaddling blankets and used these exclusively--while I'd like more, a 4 pack is working fine.They are light enough weight to use in colder or warmer weather, unlike the flannel ones which were often too hot even in the winter.We also use them for playing on the floor, protecting him from the sun in his stroller, wiping spit up, you name it.One thing to remember, they do shed little white lint balls at first.before they really stopped, but for us that was not a big problem.And the payoff is so worth it.The zoo print is very cute too, nicer than the pics make it seem.I love this product.Most baby blankets are too thick and hot for the summer or during times when you just want to thrown on something light and breatheable for the baby.You can fold these up 2 or 3 times to get to different thickness.This is hands down, the number one product I wish I had owned when my daughter was born.I didn't purchase them until she was 7 months.Well worth the initial investment.It was hard enough adjusting it right to properly cover yourself to begin with, but now the baby is old enough to start grabbing things, and guess what he likes to grab and pull off?Talk about embarrassment.The baby doesn't really care about the eye contact thing, anyways - he just wants to eat.The only use I have gotten out of this thing is as an expensive burp cloth.I ended up getting the Bebe Au Lait cover.My baby is 3.5 mos old, and I breastfeed exclusively.But even for top opening shirts, there is no way to hide the nipple when the baby's feeding.Not to mention the fact that once babies reach 3 months old, you WANT to make it so they can't see anything because they get so distracted by the world (and your face, and your voice, and anything that moves or looks more interesting than a blank wall...).I've found the Hooter Hiders and Udder Covers apron style covers with boning in the neck to be a lot easier to work with.They work with any kind of shirt you're wearing, you don't have to have two hands to put them on, and they keep baby focused on the task at hand so it doesn't take all day.I loved the concept of this and bought it when I was pregnant.Here's why:- it covers but you will still have a bit of side breast showing no matter what.It's fine if you're okay with it but if you or your spouse are the kind that aren't then you may need a cover over this.- it doesn't fall I to place easily.You have to play around withbit to get it positioned right and covering everything.In a restaurant or when your baby is crying you will wish it was faster and easier.- at first when you go to latch the baby you need to leave the table unless you're okay with your nipple showing.It takes a few minutes to situate your baby properly so initially again you need a cover for over this cover.I usually use my babys blanket.All in all great product with a few snags.I ended up getting on of those cover ups anyway for crowded places and for initially when I need to get her latched since my husband is a little less easy going about breastfeeding in public than I am.But for in the house if you have family visiting and just need a light cover and don't care of you show some skin it is excellent.It also looks good so when you wear it it's not unattractive.I have the black and when I wear black sometimes people do even notice it.This stroller is hard to review because I really, really like it except for one thing and the one thing is extremely annoying.First the good: it folds quickly and easily, is fairly compact for a double and is very easy to push and steer.That's pretty much what I want in a stroller.The seats recline and the bar on the front comes off so toddlers can climb in by themselves and you can easily clean out the cup holders.The fold does require two hands, but you can open it with one.So what's the problem?The shoulder straps keep coming unhooked.Why do they even have hooks here?I searched for a double stroller that would accommodate a car seat and fit in the trunk of my 1988 Camry.It is super lightweight and turns on a dime!I can go anywhere with this stroller.It is truly worth the money.We had twins and spent HOURS researching double strollers.We were planning on buying an upper end model from another manufacturer, but in the meantime bought this one b/c it was such a great price and it got great reviews.We've only used it a few times this year but I really like it and I'm not sure if we'll buy a more expensive stroller as we planned.The only thing we don't like is that there is no cup holder for the adults and you can't adjust the handle bars or canopy to see the babies and help protect the babies from the sun.I'd also recommend buying an insect net for it (found on combi's site) b/c we had to bring the babies in on really nice days due to bugs.It seemed to be great for my toddler and newborn.I like that the seats both recline all the way so both can take naps.*The sunshades are flimsy and don't provide much protection.I don't think a $220 stroller should have wheel problems after just one month!My 4 year old didn't want to be in it all the time, but it came in handy on several occasions.This stroller just seems to glide along, I never have any trouble w/ it.The only thing I would have changed would be bigger sun shades and cup holders for parents.This is the only stroller I have owned but so far I really love it (I have the 2009 version).Pros:-lightweight-easily fits through doorways and anywhere a wheelchair can fit-easy to recline each seat individually-quickly folds up compactly-my babies seem very comfortable in it and love to stare at the design on the inside of the sun shadesCons:-no parent cup holders (I overcame this by purchasing the JL Childress Double Wide Stroller Organizer)-sun shades are flimsy and not very protective (I overcame this by purchasing the Protect a Bub Classic Twin Sunshade  **in my opinion a must-have accessory**)-the storage baskets aren't very big and are hard to reach w/ the seats reclined-not good for uneven surfaces (like grass)UPDATE: After almost 9 months of heavy use, I still really like this stroller.I have no problem folding/unfolding and loading/unloading it from my car.A few small things have broken like the velcro on the foot muff and a few pieces of plastic off of the recline adjust buttons.However, everything still functions.I purchased mine used from Craigslist and I thought this product was wonderful.It was already assembled for me so I don't know how complicated it is to put together.Turns out you can only hand wash the product because there's some kind of plastic piece inside the seat part.The little music feature (standard chimes music, not mp3 music) is a little retarded that it only plays for a very short amount of time.Features that I do like is that it has a on/off button (if the button is off, then you won't activate the music/vibrate feature).One position is when baby is sitting and the other is when baby is moreso lying down at slight angle (I use the second position when my little one wants to sleep).I like the removable canopy to shield him from the sun at the beach (cause we have a lot of sun here in hawaii).Overall, great product compared to those cheaper bouncers...it has more functionality.we have not had any problems with any of the bristles breaking off - this thing is all one piece, so I'm not sure how people are having that problem.everyone asks me where I got this whenever my Little is chewing on it.I know high quality is what you'd expect of anything that costs $110 but there was not a stray strand anywhere on this carrier.Everything feels very well made.I was able to adjust this carrier to my body very easily and carry my (20 pound) son around with no problem.This is the top of the line baby carrier.I love this carrier after having used a Snugli and handmade sling for the first 12 months.I wish we'd invested in this one or another Ergo sooner!I love the fact that there are 3 carrying positions (front, back, and side).The back-pack style carry can be done alone (I just used it today for our morning walk), but takes about 10 good minutes of practice over a bed before really getting the hang of it.This carrier is durable and I think it will be a looong time before it shows any wear and tear.The carrier seems to put most of the baby's weight on my lower back, but really it doesn't hurt until after over an hour of wearing my 13-month old around (he's over 22 lbs at this point).That's way better than any other carrier I've used.I love my ERGO and use it every day.I had used a few different carriers with my son when he was younger and once he reached about 10 pounds it put too much strain on my back.I do not have that problem with this one, and my daughter is almost 15 pounds.With other carriers I would have to take my child out to nurse, but I can nurse my daughter discretely while she is in the ERGO.She'll fuss for a minute when I first put her in it, but she will settle down pretty quickly once she's in there.I've worn her in it for about 4 hours at a time and it never gets uncomfortable, sitting or standing.I haven't tried to carrier my older son in it yet, but I'm planning on trying it this weekend when we go to a festival.I don't know what magic is in Ergo but my baby (who is quite difficult to nap) falls asleep in it.Works like a miracle!I think I didn't wear it correctly.Anyway, still love it.I'm only 5'2" with narrow shoulder but it's not a big problem as there is a strap to lock the shoulder pads in place.Still would like to try an organic one if it's softer and more baby-friendly or not.I own a bunch of different kinds of baby carriers, and this one is the best as far as sharing with my husband goes.We can both use this very easily even though our heights and weights are quite different.Pros:-I love the color and pattern, and my husband finds it to be pleasingly unisex, so he doesn't feel dumb strapped into it.-It is great for long trips because once you get it all adjusted, the baby's weight is spread out evenly so you don't get back pain or points where it tugs.-It has a little pocket that is perfect for a diaper and few wipes, along with an ID and cash.-There are a whole bunch of matching accessories so you can kind of customize it.-The wide, padded hip belt is super comfortable, as are the padded straps.-Keeps your baby close, which I am finding to be very helpful now that it is getting colder.-Nice heavy-duty but not to heavy or rough-feeling material.-Durable, well-made.-If you take care of it, you can usually re-sell it for a pretty good price.Cons:-It can be hard to get on without help.OK, Ergo people, chances are if we are wearing a baby then we JUST HAD a frigging baby, so maybe a little help here?It is not at all flattering and a bit uncomfortable.-Adjusting can be a pain in the butt, but I guess that is what you get for a very adjustable one size fits all- so one of my cons is actually a result of my main pro, that fact that I can share it.-My baby loves being in it.-It holds your baby close, which does suck a little when it is hot out, but this will happen with pretty much every carrier, so I guess it is a con about babywearing in general, not about this particular one.-I can't wear my diaper bag on my shoulder when wearing this because the bag slips off, so perhaps a backpack style bag, a matching Ergo bag, or a servant (*ahem* husband) to carry my bag around is required.-It is not cheap.I do really like this carrier.Did it exceed all expectations and make me dash out and burn all my other carriers?No, but I do like it enough that it is in heavy rotation.Also, I hated it for the first hour or so because I couldn't figure it out and the directions that are packed with it suck.Your baby needs to be a pro at head control.I didn't put my son in until he started sitting, late in his sixth month.This helps me go up and down a stairwell without baby nearly falling out of my arm because I'm trying to hold baby bags and he's squirming and I'm also trying to keep an eye on the toddler.This also saves me extra trips out to my car if I have a few bags to carry upstairs, I just hitch him up on my back and make the one trip.My son does like the framed carriers but the reason I choose the Ergo is because you can fold it/ scrunch it up in the basket of a stroller.If you take a framed one out with you, you either have to keep it on the whole time or find a place for it.The ERGO,in my opinion, is better for my son and me than the Maya wrap because it holds my baby more securely, and also I get to be completely hands free.I didn't feel she was completely secure in the wrap as my son is in the ERGO.In the early months I used a sleepy wrap with my son and the reasons I prefer ERGO over the sleepy wrap is because the sleepy wrap has A LOT of fabric, it takes time to put it on, whereas the ERGO just snaps on.Putting baby on my back totally frees up my hands and space in front of me.Thank you ERGO you have made my life much easier!I use this carrier every day with my daughter.I wore her against my chest until she was about nine months, then a couple weeks on my hip, and since then she's been on my back where she can see better.She's now about 23 lbs and the carrier still works great.We've used it for short trips to the store and long 5+ mile walks.The hood is nice as a sun shade or for when baby falls asleep.Carrier is well made, light, and small/flexible enough that it can be easily brought wherever we go.I highly recommend this for moms who want/need to get out and about without the stroller!My daughter loves this carrier almost instantly wether she is fussy or not she falls asleep she is that comfortable in it.Those long sleepless night I got the carrier out put her in it and she was out!This carrier is very comfortable for me to wear all the weight sits on my hips and not my back or shoulders.And so does my baby.I love this carrier!I have a moby wrap & a baby bjorn.. they bjorn is a bit quicker to get on, but kills my back after only a few min.'s.the moby was great when my baby was little & easier to nurse in, but everytime i had to take her out it was so streched that i would have to redo the whole thing which is a pain & it was very hot!with the ergo i can wear it for hours before my back hurts if at all.but i have back issues so its probably not the carriers fault.if she fell asleep while in it i could take her out in the insert lay her down & she would sleep like that nicely.They only reason i gave it 4 stars is because i'm over 6' & pretty thin.. the shoulder straps get in my way sometimes.they are so padded that even though they are confrotable they get in the way on my shoulders.still would buy it again in a heart beat!& the galaxy grey is so cute!This is my 5th carrier, and by far my favorite.The chicco is a front carrier that was ok, but it started hurting my back after 10 minutes (and it was hard to slip him in and out).I can see myself using this for a long time to come.We LOVE our ergo.Great carriers.But, I only recommend them once your kids are about 6 months old.They just get kind of smooshed up against you and smothered.I've heard the new ones are better, but not tried one yet.With smaller kids (under 6 months), you are probably better off in a bjorn or a moby-wrap or something like that.But, as the kids get older and heavier, you will want to switch to an ergo.Ergo has much better back support.When you kid gets older the ergo is much more comfortable for you and your kid.You can wear it in front with a smaller kid (6-18 months) or on your back like a back-pack with a bigger kid.We're still using it for my 27 lbs 2.5 year old; and I imagine we'll get another year out of it at least.I would whole heartedly give the Ergo 5 stars if it were just a tad bigger.Like others said, you have to be a size 10 to wear this and no I am not going to pay more for an extension piece.I am returning this one and got the Ergo Performance instead.We purchased the Ergo Performance because of this problem and I would give that 5 stars, it has a bigger waist strap.Like all the other reviews on here, we do use the Baby Bjorn and Snugli now that she's little and will switch to the Ergo when she can easily straddle us.Ergo is definitely worth the investment...save money on other items that you can easily get second hand.Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel LiningI read a lot of great reviews for the Ergo Baby but I have to say I was a little disappointed :( It is pretty darn tricky to clasp the back clasp; I usually get it on by leaning over a bed, having the clasp already closed, putting my baby in the carrier, and then trying to snake into it.It kept her so close to me that every time she turned her head it knocked her pacifier out of her mouth so I was constantly stopping, leaning forward, and putting her pacifier back in.It would be soooo much better if there was a way to have them face out in this thing.Also, the head rest/ sun shade thing covered her ALL the way up so she couldn't see what was going on and that would frustrate her so as a sun shade it really didn't work for me.It did provide great back support, but it was so hard to get into plus the pacifier maintenance and lack of sun shade made me stop using it.I ended up just putting my baby in a stroller for our walks :(From word of mouth and what I've seen, I bought the Ergo because of it's great reputation for comfort during extended wearing sessions.It DOESN'T fail to deliver.I started wearing baby at about 3 weeks (he's now 13 weeks) and this has allowed for so much mobility while he's napping on me or simply wants to hang out on mamma.In the beginning (and I've seen this with other users) I did NOT snug the straps properly and sometimes felt strains on my back...but once I realized what I was doing and corrected it, I had now problems.I've worn him for up to 3-5hour stretches and feel as good as should be expected given I'm carrying a baby on the outside.We ordered the Camel color because we'll be using this tons during the summer and didn't want the added 'heat' issue of having a black exterior.Make sure you fold them out all the way.I made the mistake of not doing that, so ordered the extension.After that, I realized I already had the extra two inches I needed.Overall, great product.I really like this baby carrier.I had a little trouble with adjusting the shoulder straps at first, but not too much, and I got the hang of it.It's very user friendly.I do want to point out that I think the infant insert is a waste of money, unless maybe if you are planning to use this with a premature baby or just a really small baby.I didn't use this until my daughter was about 2 weeks old and we didn't need the infant insert.By that time, she was about 8 pounds, so I guess I can't say for sure that you wouldn't need it for a smaller baby, but I don't think so.She falls asleep in it almost immediately.The Ergo Baby Carrier is the best invention for a parent ever!We have a newborn and he falls asleep within minutes of walking with him in it.Much better than the other brands because it places the weight on your hips.The other brands hurt my back in between the shoulder blades after only a 10-15 minute walk.First lets get a few things out of the way - yes the baby has to be facing you, and yes the carrier is expensive - but you have to look at all the research that has gone into it.Babies and toddlers are NOT supposed to hang by their crotch - how would you like to be carried around like that??This carrier is ergonomically correct for both mommy AND baby.I leave the waist belt strapped on for a significant part of the day, and just let the carrier and straps hang down when the little one isn't in it.I don't have any problems getting the sternum together by myself, you just have to leave the shoulder straps a little loose ( 2-3 in), reach up behind your neck, find the buckle, and then tighten the shoulder straps.I successfully nurse my baby with the carrier on - just pull the goods out of the top of my shirt and he helps to hold it in his mouth.Sometimes I slide the waist belt down a couple inches so I don'y have to stretch the udder too far, but no complaints here.I wouldn't trade this carrier for anything!SOOO worth the money!As a mom with 3 kids under 3 and under (3 yr old, 2 yr old and 4 mo old) it is veristale for all my kids and they all love it!The infant insert is a must under 6 mo :)!EDIT: my baby is 5 months old now and we still LOVE our ergo!!we stopped using the infant insert at about 4 months and he looooves being in it now.i breastfeed him in it too!i can make dinner while he is in there eating away!hands free for me!also, absolutely no back pain or strain!I love the Ergo.It is great for grocery shopping, around the airport, walking, doing chores around the house!My son often falls asleep while in it.It fits great and best of all your body doesn't hurt from wearing your baby!Often times people just think he is asleep!Love my Ergo, it's the one thing I couldn't live w/o.I am looking forward to using this baby carrier from infant to 4 years of age.My 16 mo old loves being in the Ergo and I love having him close by.The Ergo is engineered in such a way that you do not feel like you're carrying 25lbs.It's a great product and easy to put on.I can stuff so many things in it that I don't need to carry a diaper bag.I think with babywearing, the key is to start right away.My son only wants to be in the Ergo, he doesn't want to sit in a grocery cart or walk in a store.This can be good and kind of annoying, but at least I don't have to chase around a toddler while I'm trying to shop.I love how when he's feeling shy he can bury his head into my chest and when he's feeling playful, he can touch my face.We're still using this carrier for my 30 lb 1 year old.I love that my husband and I can both use this carrier.The back carry is a little intimidating initially, but it is much simpler once the child is old enough to hold on.The instructional videos are very good.You won't be disappointed with this carrier!This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on theBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Black(4 stars), theBoba Classic Baby Carrier, Breeze(4 stars), theInfantino Ecosash Baby Carrier, Bloomin Vines, 8-35 Pounds(3 stars), and theInfantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds(2 stars).Here's her general intro:"I'm 5'5" and around 130 lbs.Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Ergo:"This is truly our favorite baby product in our home.Over the last 2 years, I have done everything with this carrier: hiked, camped, climbed lighthouse stairs, shopped, cooked, cleaned, nursed, taken trains, buses, and hayrides, even peed in the woods for cripes sake and this thing has never failed us.PROS:* The design is sturdy and comfortable.* The shoulder straps are a full four inches longer than on the Boba which allows for a more central back buckle.* The hood is genius and holds my kids' heads while sleeping on the front or back.* The D-ring is great for attaching toys when the babes get bored.* Adjusting from Mom to Dad and back again is simple.* The back carry is great for when your child gets a little older and their head just won't fit below yours any more.* The carrier feels very secure and safe.* Comes with a DVD (at least it used to) and there are many helpful videos on YouTube.* I can wear this for hours and not feel sore.CONS:* It is expensive.I know many moms who want one but can't dish out the money.That said, the resale value is very high (a major PRO), so if you can put up the cash to start, you can probably sell it in a couple years for $60 or $70 depending on wear.* The waist band is not as stiff as on some other carriers which puts a very small amount of the weight on your back, not a big deal to me, but might be to some (but the softer waist band allows you to sit while wearing it and doesn't cause as much chafing around the hips.I know, I know, another PRO in the CONS section).* The hood is a little hard to grab by myself when wearing on the back, but not impossible.They tout this on their website.I was trying another infant carrier but he keeps crying when I put him on the other one so i returned it 7 bought this carrier when another mommy recommended it to me.I could go on and on about how lovely this product is and how much easier it has made my/our lives.I do however want to include some frustrations I had with the product to be fair.I'm going to list my pros/cons to help you decide if this product is for you.PROS:1.Great back support.I have worn my son in the carrier for hours on end with no pain whatsoever.3.It allows you the freedom to run errands easily without having to worry about your little one getting fussy.My son preferred this carrier hands down over sitting in a grocery cart.5.No need to lug around heavy cumbersome stroller.Pocket in front pouch is just enough room for cell phone, wallet, keys.7.Backpack accessory has enough room for a couple diapers, a snack, and drinks and is nice to have.However, I find that I don't really use it that much because it feels a bit bulky.8.He just never tolerated the infant insert which he outgrew at about 2 months but was still too small for the carrier until he was about 5 months.It was frustrating initially, but I think as long as you don't count on using it initially you won't be disappointed.2.Like I said, the infant insert was not useful.The back carry was VERY frustrating initially.I just wanted so badly to use it for the back carry but my son didn't like being on my back until he got a bit bigger (at about 10 months old).However, once you get the hang of the back carry, it really becomes second nature.4.The product is made in China.I worry about the fabric and the safety of the fabric.I have even heard that the Organic line is sprayed too.Again, I don't know this for a fact, just something I heard others talk about.5.I can imagine this might be a real problem for others.However, with a little wardrobe adjusting or selection this is a non issue.Finally, I would buy this product again with no hesitation.And, I must say, I've tried about every pack and Ergo is the only one remotely comfortable (there is an Ergo-like pack, that is probably as good and I have not tried it).Thus, my final verdict is: get a Bjorn for an infant, then get an Ergo when your kids can hold on to you as you throw them in the backpack.You can get used Bjorns or Bjorn knock-offs cheap at your local kid consignment store or on ebay.NOTE: This is re: a 3-year old carrier.I just do not understand what people see in this carrier.The pros:Yep, it is comfortable (in 2 of 3 positions).The cons:I have a pretty good reverse namaste,but in any position except as a backpack, the straps are absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to reach or adjust.The carrier effectively requires two people to get it on.In the side position, you need someone to adjust the over shoulder strap.If you aren't any of those things, don't even think about this carrier).No amount of tightening will keep them on the shoulder straps.There is a gap when baby is done facing in on front but is too small to move to back.This is quasi-comfortable, but the numerous design flaws make it untenable as a carrier.But as a *BABY* carrier, save your money.it does what is supposed to do... hold many things.but for me, I didn't like how messy it can looks with many things in it.I used it for a while but, after 2 months, I just used basket to put everything.you really don't need this item to survive.We purchased this feeding seat for temporary use until we move and invest in a real high-chair.Also, adjusting the seat angle never fails to be a source of frustration.The plastic doesn't slide easily and significant force is required to squeeze the tabs in.Honestly, if my husband is home, I usually take the lazy route and ask him to do it.Finally, the fact that this seat does sit completely up is a plus since a number of seats on the market don't seem to do this.Bottom line: A great feeding seat for temporary use or for "Grandma's house."I bought this chair a few months ago and I HATE it.When my twins were newborn and I placed one of them in this chair they seemed to be sitting uncomfortably and quite upright.I kept it as I thought they may like it once they were older.Now at three and a half months they will sit in the chair without crying, but their necks seem to be lying at a dangerous angle.The twin with less head control has his head slumped on his chest and I worry about damage to his neck; I think there may even be a positional asphyxia danger with this seat.I do not use the seatbelt since she has always fit snug in it.Since she's a little taller now, I can place toys at the base of the pod, and she will reach down and pick them up.I did not buy a tray for mine, but that might be useful to have too.My baby has always preferred sitting upright rather than leaning back, so the Pod has been perfect for her rather than a bouncy seat.She loves sitting in this and playing with her toys.There is a smell when its right out pf the box, but I find it quite pleasant.It smells just like diaper rash cream.Let me tell you, after seeing how many things it can do, I would easily pay the $130 regular price for it.Even my husband was amazed!First, do not be fooled into thinking this is a simple car seat cover or foot muff.It can easily be used as a snow suit for babies not able to walk (think of a portable sleeping bag for the baby), a car seat cover, a stroller cover, and a fleece blanket.My husband was worried about safety in terms of padding being IN the car seat while traveling (the extra blanket UNDER the baby).Which is even BETTER is that it can be seperated and be ONLY a cover for the top/ front of the car seat (so no padding in the back.The hood can unzip, fold down, and has a removeable fur lining on the top of it.What I personally love best is the added warmth that can be removed.You will NOT be disappointed!The headboard was broken upon arrival, and then amazon didnt have any left to do an even exchange.we returned it and ordered a different company.hopefully will have better luck, disappointed.We received our toddler bed sooner than we expected.We did not have trouble with it being damaged in transport.My husband put it together in under an hour and did not have trouble like others were saying.I would recommend this bed for anyone looking for a quality bed at a reasonable price.I found that the espresso finish of this toddler bed is more of a mahogany color.Product was fairly simple to put together & seems to be very sturdy.My 3 year old loves it & her 6 year old cousin has even slept in it.This is a grat toddler bed.We did a lot of comparrison shopping.The bed arrived on time.It took my sister and I, who are pretty handy, less than an hour to put together.There were no scratches ot dents in the wood and it is true to the picture.After using for a month.NOT hard, not heavy.When attaching the suspension (rubber, elastic?- springy, bouncy things) you must line them up to their grooves or it will seem much more difficult.Easy to clean.Lots of places to hang toys.Our 4 month old took about a day or two to figure out the whole bounce concept.He is still working on rotating the seat with intention.He likes to have teething toys attached to the side to gnaw on when he takes a break from the bouncing.This is not a bad thing, but was a little surprising to see how wide it actually was when assembled.I am impressed with this product.I highly recommend it and I would buy it again.I registered for the baby Einstein jumper because in store it seemed sturdier and a better value than the Fisher Price jumperoo.I have this one at home and for my moms, I got a second hand Fisher Price jumperoo (the one with the monkey seat).My 6 month old definitely rathers the one at my moms.The FP also bounces alot more and she can reach the ground better (both are set on lowest setting and she is about 26" long right now).The FP is also alot lighter and easier to move around.The baby einstein is pretty heavy and can't even fit through doorways in my house other than the front door.He goes nuts in it!I love how you can hang things from it and you can switch what you want to hang.For that matter he loves just plying with the links that you use to hang things with...I wasn't really sure what purpose the sun had, it seemed kind of pointless, but boy was I wrong!Now he's 6 months old and has just discovered the "piano" part.He's completely amazed by it.This jumper is closer to the ground than others I've looked at.My three month old is able to touch the ground with his toes on the lowest setting.He's not able to touch many of the toys as they are just out of reach.I've resolved this issue by hanging toys across the two overhead bars (using links).He does love pushing up off the ground even though he hasn't mastered jumping yet.This toy is great for any age baby who can sit up with some assistance.At that point, he would just pretty much sit in it and reach for the toys, but he enjoyed sitting in it.It would be difficult for the same toys to appeal to a 4 month old and a 10 month old, so we have added some toys to it over time.We have never had any problems with the sturdiness of the bouncer, and the only thing we've had to do was to change the batteries once.One disappointing note - the jumper doesn't fold flat unless you disassemble it, which is a pain.He loves chewing on the flower teethers and gets really excited playing with the keyboard.The only negative feature is the adjustable height.He could only touch one foot on the floor if he leaned to one side.Pretty easy to put together although I had a few issues trying to adjust the height.What I like best about this is that is cleanble.Well how are supposed to keep in germ free then?We got this as a hand me down from a friend and we love it.We were able to take out the seat fabric and throw it in the washer (warning: don't wash in hot water as it will shrink), We were able to take out the toys and really get around and underneath them clean.Then we just used a Bissel steam cleaner to get everything clean-even did the coils.It just seems very well made.My daughter is almost 10 months old and she's big for her age at 23.5 lbs and 29" long.We've been putting her in this thing since she could hold her neck and back straight really well, so maybe 4 months old.She hated it at first, crying when I'd put her in it.At about 5 months she started let me put her in without crying but she wouldn't really play with the toys.She really enjoyed it when I would push a button on the piano but it was too stiff for her to press them.At about 6-7 months she started to really enjoy the toys, buut it wasn't until about 8 months that she started figuring out the bouncing part of it and now she LOVES it.It makes me sad because she's only a pound and a half from outgrowing this toy and she's just starting to get the most out of it.I guess she'll be cruising soon and it won't matter anyway but I do wish that they'd go up to 30 lbs.It's a fun toy, but for the price, you really ought to get more than a few months of fun out of it.I'm impressed with it, too.He's been using it since he was  4 months old.He was a bit short for it, so his parents folded up an exercise mat to put under his feet.He plays with all the toys, and loves chewing on the sun.He makes good use of the swivel seat which turns 360 degrees so he can play with all the toys.The jumper gives him exercise and helps with his hand/eye co-ordination.When set up it measures approx.Speaking as a grandma, I think the Einstein products are well-thought-out and well-made activity toys for babies.I wish they had been around when I needed them.He will sit in this thing for 45 minutes and bounce, play, and stare at the toys.That's nice because it gives Mom and Dad a break.:)I would not recommend trying to use this with babies who cannot pick up their heads well, as there is not much support in the sling seat.Also, make sure your baby weighs enough to bounce (I found that my son needed to be at least 15.5 lbs - he weighed this at 4 mos - before he weighed down the bouncer enough to touch the floor on the lowest setting).Pros:  easy to assemble (except putting the seat cover on required a bit of strength), baby loves the toys, music is not overly annoying, music has 2 volume levels, frog spinner is delightful for my son, mirror is very good, links are handy, product is fairly well-made, packs away easily.Cons: takes up a lot of space, doesn't "fold" for storage - must disassemble a slight bit.The mirror and the teether stems are a bit hit, as are the reaching loops.Now I really wish the "anchor" hooks were replaced with a food tray, but that's not a big deal.)2) Looks better than that rain forest one fisher price makes, just looks more classy to me3) Overall one of the BEST baby gear/toy purchases we made.My LO is 8 months now and can jump and jump forever in this thing.It's better than a free-floating jumper because the springs are tougher, so she stays in one spot and can just safely jump up and down.She also loves the frog, and I really like how you can change toys on the bars.But now that she can, the jumping is endless contentment for both of us.The three criticisms I have are: 1. the height setting problem meant that I had to buy a different excersaucer until she was tall enough to totally enjoy this one.When it doesn't make any sound, she loses interest, gets bored and then cranky.3: There aren't enough toys in general that come standard.I appreciate the hooks being changable, but for this price, there should be a little more flare than a piano and a frog and flowers.We just got this jumper for my son a few weeks ago and he is having a blast.It took him a week or so to learn that he could really jump in it, but now he can't stop.As soon as we put him in it he jumps his little heart out and giggles the whole time.He has so much fun jumping he really doesn't pay much to attention to the toys.I really like the keyboard.It plays fun music that isn't annoying like other baby toys.It isn't too loud either.I also like the toy hooks.I also got more Baby Einstein Links to attach to the 6 overhead hooks, the jumper only came with 7.The FP jumperoo toys were fine, but I could imagine the noises and music getting very annoying after a while.I have a Graco Snugride carseat.When I put this thing on I thought it was going to poke my daughter's eye out.Needless to say I took it off and returned it.This is not meant for all carseats and that should be made clear in the description.I purchased this for my four month old.She was only entertained for a minute and then screamed until it was removed.The infant carrier handle was as far back as it could go but this toy still seemed to be right on top of her.I gave it two stars because it had an excellent price ($9 at Walmart) and it stayed attached well.We love this line, although our baby isn't picky as long as formula is coming from it.Medium flow playtex nipples were hard to find in our local stores so Amazon came through!The medium flow gave him his milk faster without causing tons of spit-ups afterwards.She stops and pushes away or cries, and then refuses to drink until I put a different nipple on the bottle.She prefers the slow flow soft Latex ones, so I just ordered more of those.Every baby is different, so you have to just try different things and see what works.You don't HAVE to go up to a faster flow if your baby doesn't want to.I purchased a black embroidered organic Ergo and realized later that it did not have a pocket like other Ergos.I thus got the pouch off of Amazon.The pouch is worth the money and it much more versatile than initially anticipated.The strap itself is adjustable and features a handy clip with which you can quickly attack and detach the strap.I keep some doggy bags, my wallet, my iphone, ipod, keys, a burp cloth, a pacifier, a pack of kleenex and my rescue inhaler in it.It has turned into my "mommy purse."I keep it in whichever diaper bag I am using and is the only thing I take with me if I have to run a quick errand by myself.My 12 month old takes these out of the outlets easily...then it goes in his mouth easily cause its round...Found one stuck in his mouth today and him drooling...(it's too large to swallow but he was able to get it way in the back of his mouth).I previously had the oval ones from walmart which he also is able to remove however due to its shape he did not get it way to the back of his mouth.As for outlet covers, I am totally bummed now.. guess I will have to place electrical tape over the outlets.I have no recommendations but I can advise u to also consider shape of outlet covers u plan to use in your home.I absolutely love this breast pump!It is quiet,light weight, pumps painlessly and is VERY efficient.I would recomend this product to any woman who wants to keep up her milk supply and provide the best nutrition for her baby.I also like that the bag and cooler bag are very discreet with no name brand written on them.I HIGHLY recommend this pump!Update, 5/19/2011:I still LOVE this pump!The pump works as good as it did the first time I used it!I first had to pump 5 times/day and am now down to twice a day as am getting ready to wean my (almost 12 month) baby boy.It works as good as it did the first time I used it, 11 months ago.A plus: I needed new tubing - Medela has excellent customer service and sent me a complimentary set of tubing, free!I couldn't be happier having chosen this pump!!I breastfed my daughter for over two years and this pump served us very well.They area bit pricey, but you are truly getting what you pay for!Also, they will last through several babies.Medela's customer service is unbeatable.I previously owned an original Medela pump and when it started to lose suction, I called Medela (it was still under warranty) and they not only replaced it, but upgraded me twice as the pump I had was discontinued and the regular pump in style advanced was backordered (the only difference between this one and the regular pump in style advanced is the bag).I recommend these pumps to all of my breastfeeding friends.don't be fooled by other brands of breast pumps because of cost.I'm a stay at home mom so 99% of the time I breastfeed but I needed a pump to go back to work for a week and for the occasional night or weekend away.I tried to get by with the manual pump and after several tries I just could not get it to work.My hand would get tired and the suction was just not strong enough to get much out.It did not hurt at all - I use the suction at a little over halfway.It is a but loud but they all are.I have very small breasts (even while breastfeeding I'm still an A) and the shields that came with the pump work fine for me.Smaller ones might work better but I don't have any problems with these.The bag is nothing special.It didn't even have room for a wallet, cell phone and keys.The suction/speed is only one knob that controls both.When my first daughter was born, I had a lot of problems getting her to latch properly.It was a painful first eight weeks and that is when I fell in love with this pump - I could pump during this time and it didn't hurt like it did when I nursed.I was eventually able to nurse without pain but I continued to use the pump on a regular basis to allow me some flexibility and the ability to be away from my daughter for more than a few hours at a time, but to still give her breast milk and keep my supply up.I don't know what I would have done without this pump!Although this cost more than a lot of other pumps, I highly recommend it if you think that you will pump with any sort of regularity.The double pump because it cuts pumping time in half of a single pump.I really did not have any problems with it.This product has really helped me as a working mom and has kept my milk supply up.All the good things others say in their reviews about the product are absolutely true.Some minor inconveniences for me were as follows:1) The breast shields weren't perfect for me - I would have to press them in at different angles to completely empty my breast.To overcome this problem I bought a hands free pumping bra (which are snug due to the purpose) and that helped with the problem and my breast started emptying out without manipulation.2) I think the connect of the tubes to the pump look flimsy.I was super careful with them because of this so nothing went wrong for me but i can imagine someone less careful having problems with thisMy wife has had this Medela Pump for 6 months and loves it.The pump is heavy but the shoulder bag contains it perfectly.It is also convenient that it can run on battery, as she had to use it once discretely in the back seat of our crew cab truck (with tinted windows, of course) on a long trip.She called it a "lifesaver.This is my second PIS.It's great--I have never had a problem with the pump.Initially, we had used a hospital pump when my son came home.I can't imagine trying to do without it as a working mom--I recommend it to all my friends.I love this pump... obviously I haven't bought any others (I do have a hand pump, yuck!).But I have also heard from many friends that this product is totally worth the money.I would however recommend buying the bottle gift set, as you don't get enough bottles to be able to pump and store.I started with a Medela Symphony rental from the hospital when our son was in the NICU.The pump itself works well, though I have no point of comparison other than the Symphony, and definitely not with a less expensive brand.Pumps are not exactly products you can test out and return:)The bag, while discreet, isn't terribly fashionable.For the price, I would have loved a hands-free attachment.The Pump In Style does just that (though I never felt remotely stylish while using it).One suggestion would be to be able to zip out the pump part (perhaps in a cosmetic bag size)for travel.not to mention the baby himself.I am hopeful that is is a durable product so I can justify the purchase of it spread across a few kids.But, in terms of pumps, I hear it is the best and I have no major complaints.I just got mine today through Apria, whose full price is a little less ($250).My insurance covered 50% of the cost under my Durable Medical Equipment (DME) coverage with a prescription from my OB so I only paid $125.Some insurance companies will only cover pumps under certain circumstances but it's worth checking before paying full price.I purchased this pump when I realized my single electric pump just wasn't cutting it.After only a few days of using this pump, I don't know how I lived without it.I did have to buy a different size of breast-shields but that's okay!I also like that most bottles (besides just medela's) work with this pump.I do not like, however, that this is definitely not a hands-free pump and you have to sit there and hold the bottles on each boob the whole time!Also, my pump does not let me do one side only- the suction doesn't work right unless both are being pumped at the same time.I don't know if this is a fault with mine or if it is like this for all the Medelas..?Purchased as a gift for our daughter during her pregnancy,  we had no idea how much she would love it.She uses it during nursing and many times during the day to cuddle the baby when she is not doing so herself.Our little one loves the way it feels and is immediately satisfied when in it.Plus it's big enough to keep handy stuff in like, a wallet or make-up.This is the only thing I carry around at school and everyone just assumes it's a backpack!I usually only have to pump for about 10 minutes and I'm done, which is great since I don't have all the time in the world.I have been using a Medela Symphony hospital grade pump for my baby who is in NICU.It is smaller than say a school backpack, but a bit larger than a fashion backpack.-The cooler works great for the little 2 oz bottles I get from the NICU.I really have no need to use bigger bottles for now, and I can fit 9 of them in the cooler and stick the ice pack on top.I am the only female where I work and this pack keeps others from commenting on the new contents of the fridge.-Has the same 2 phase system as the Symphony, and on a pretty low setting, I still was expressing.CONS:-The noise the pump makes it pretty annoying.It isn't so loud that it would cause others to be disturbed, but it was very distracting to me.I like the Medela backpack pump.I wish I bought a pump that was a little smaller.I have to take my purse, my work bag, my lunch bag and now this medela pump to work.Maybe I should have bought the hand pump...the only thing is that it will take longer for me to pump at work.ANother thing that I was disappointed with is that it comes with 4 bottles bot only one collar and nipple.So what I have to do is pump and use another bottle (I use Avent) to feed my baby.My daughter was born 1 month early and spent some time in the NICU.I was able to use this pump at home during the night to keep up my milk supply.The suction is great, almost as good as the hospital grade pumps.I used this pump every day, all day, for months and it stood up beautifully!The main reason I bought this over the others was the accessibility to replacement parts.Medela parts are widely available through your local Babies R Us and Target stores, which makes it much more convenient in emergency situations.Other brands like Avent and Ameda just aren't that accessible at this time.In the beginning I had low milk supply so I was only getting maybe an ounce on each breast, but gradually I noticed my supply increasing and I was able to pump out much more.Each lactation consultant encouraged me to pump in between feedings, which was a hassle, but I do think it helped with my supply.The adjustable settings of the pump helped with let down.In one 15 minute pump session I would alternate between the two "phases" and that would help me express more milk.I also found it very helpful to massage my breasts while pumping to maximize the amount of milk pumped.The backpack is very discreet and no one knew I was carrying a breastpump to work.It can be a little loud, but it did not bother me.I did not have a problem with the quality of the backpack like others did.Once I went back to work I used my PIS 2-4 times a day, carrying it back and forth from home to work.I purchased extra shields at Target so that I didn't have to wash after every pump, which I think is well worth the cost of the extra shields.I never used the battery pack, but I did purchase a car adapter, which I only used once.The one time I did use it, it worked very well.I do recommend purchasing a pumping bra so that you don't have to hold onto the bottles for 15-20 minutes.I found it difficult to try to hold the bottles and turn the machine on then in the middle switch from the different phases.I purchased this to have as a back up to myBoppy Classic Nursing Pillow with Soft Boa Slipcover, Teddy Bears, while the teddy bear cover was in the wash.It's not near as nice as the teddy bear cover, but is still of good quality.I purchased this prior to returning to work from maternity leave.The adapter allowed me to pump while my husband drove and our little man snoozed in the back.Now that I am back at work, this has come in handy when I needed to pump while at off-site meetings.I would suggest getting the Medla wipes if you are going to be using this in the car a lot...they make things a lot easier when there isn't access to water for cleaning.So much better than the battery adapter, which always seems like its struggling to power the pump.Without going into explicit detail, I will say they worked for the issue that I needed them for.Wonderful for normal trips such as the grocery store.Nice size enough for regular small trips soi do not have to carry the big monster of a diaper bag I also have just to go to the store.I love this bag for short outings.I just wish the strap were a tad bit longer for cross body wear.I bought this after having some difficulty in getting a good handprint from my 4 month old baby.This worked fabulous!I was able to re-try several times until I was satisfied with the handprint.I got two prints out of it, but it was tight.We go this product for our first child's baby shower and I ordered one for my second.The best thing is that the clay is not messy.It takes several tries to get your infant's hand/foot print done right.We are dealing with clenched fists and rolled up toes.The clay re-rolled easily.It took 6 tries for my son's hand and it was no problem.TIP: I used the backside of the clay after I rolled because it was smoother.The leftover clay was just enough for a foot print.The plastic ring is tricky.But bending it around a bit got the circle I desired.You want a home-made look to the project anyway.After, you can pick out a cute paper background and glue gun it in to a shadow box.We had a great time making the imprints for our twins' hands and feet.It was very quick and there was no mess to clean up afterwards.Also, there was enough foam in a kit to do both a hand and a foot.However, the final product is very lightweight and rather soft.I would also recommend using something to cut it out other than the included ring because we had a hard time getting the ring to look even.I thought this was a little expensive (for what you get in the kit) but turns out that there is enough clay to make 2 ornaments (for baby or toddler-sized hands).I divided the clay in half, kneaded, then rolled out (use a metal can, the wooden roller sticks to the clay) made a circle out of the enclosed tape then shaped the clay to fit the circle (rolling and reshaping as needed) so there was minimal waste of clay, then press the hand into the clay.If you don't get a good impression, you can repeat again until you get the impression you want.I was very excited to make a footprint mold for my son's first Christmas.I liked that this product was super easy to use and created very very little mess.It took us a few tried to get a decent footprint (forget the hands!he just wanted to grab it)  Anyway it was nice that we could start over if we didn't get it right the first time.After we got a decent print we use the plastic ring to shape the mold.The plastic piece was folded in the box to getting a perfect circle wasn't happening, but it still turned out mostly even.What disappointed me the most was after I waited and waited for this thing to dry it is still spongy.If you press too hard you can still create an indent and I has been drying for over a week now.I do not see how this is going to last for any amount of time.Definitely not a terrible product but I'm searching for something better that will last longer.I bought this for a friend and being a mom myself, I can truly recognize a fantastic product when I see one.I saved them the trouble and assembled it and it truly was not all that bad.Took me a half an hour.I was really worried about buying this after reading the negative reviews...but am so happy I went with my gut and got it.I was expecting a teeny-tiny sleeping area and a loud, grinding motor.I would compare the motor to any standard swing motor, nothing louder than that and I would say you can expect to use this for 3-4 months.That is pretty much the same for anything besides a co-sleeper.As far as the "not being able to haul it up and down the stairs," I am not sure what bassinet or play yard is convenient to drag up and down anyhow.I would however, describe this bassinet as somewhere it will stay put in...like in the master bedroom.As far as aesthetics, this bassinet is the Roles Royce of bassinets...none other compare to it.As far as the "mattress" goes, I would agree with it being substandard.I tried putting a quilt underneath the entire pad and it gives it the cushion and give while still keeping the safe, rigid sleeping surface for a newborn.Easy fix.I liked this product as it matched the decor in our house.I'm just sad that he's now outgrown it and he isn't 3 months yet (and he's a little smaller than average).One thing that we didn't like in the beginning was that the sides are high, so he couldn't see us and it was hard for us to see him from a seated position.But the high sides were good for getting him to sleep so that he wasn't distracted by much.Like others have said, it's a little hard to move around since there are wheels only on one side, so it doesn't turn well.It wasn't loud enough to bother our baby, who was a great sleeper, but it really annoyed me when those late night wakings came around.the little toy that hangs on it is not very functional and gets in the way most of the time.and when it's not being used, because its got a bulky shape, it's always sticking out in annoying ways.Unlike other baby bouncers, we were drawn to the color and look of this product.The 'vibrate' setting works wonders to keep my baby sleeping longer!The nature sounds and the musical settings are also nice... not annoying like some that you hear on other baby accessories.The only critique I have is of the dangling toy (dragonfly?).It only swivels 90 degrees to one side.Also, my baby has virtually ZERO interest in the toy... so I'm convinced that it's there just for looks.My daughter slept in this chair for about 3 months in her bassinet and crib because she had reflux and also got a cold so she had to stay elevated.I agree with other reviews where it's not very interesting at all but served it's purpose for us.Also looks better then all the really baby-looking stuffI searched high and low for this highchair because of the great reviews and how nice it looked - what a mistake.The removable tray is supposedly dishwasher safe - one cycle through the dishwasher has warped it so that it no longer attaches to the main tray.The tray does not slide on, it snaps on from the top...which makes removing it one handed (while holding a child) pretty tricky.The reclining feature is very cheaply designed and does not instill confidence (think thin, easily breakable plastic latches).I absolutely DO NOT recommend this highchair.We were extremely pleased with the swing.our daughter was no longer interested in it after 4 months or so, but for the first 3 months, it was a life-saver.This swing is amazing...there are a lot of positive reviews so I don't feel I need to say much.My baby snuggles right in and goes to sleep the majority of the time in this swing.Makes it perfect to take to another room but also doesn't make you waste batteries.My 6mo old only recently grew out of it, so it lasted quite a while for us.Other swings I've seen definitely would not have lasted so long for my large baby!One thing I dislike is that the mobile on top doesn't move on it's own.I wish it would be motorized so it could revolve and give the baby something to look at!We received this already assembled so I can't comment on that, but we really think this swing is a good product.I wanted a more modern swing than the ones I have seen in the stores, and after a lot of research I went ahead and spent the money on this swing.Putting it together took about 30 minutes.I also had problems snapping in the pieces, but my husband had no trouble with it, so I gave up and let him finish :)Fisher Price says that this swing is for newborns up to 12 months.That is another reason I bought the swing.But now that our baby is here (she is 1 month now) I cannot imagine being able to fit her into this swing past 5 or 6 months.She already seems pretty uncomfortable in it, her shoulders barely fit in it and I think it swings a bit too fast for newborns, even on the lowest setting.The mobile doesnt move, which probably makes sense, since the swing already does.But if she was just sitting in it without moving, it would be nice to have the option of a rotating mobile.All in all, the swing is nice, but I dont think its worth the money, since there is no way it can be used more than a couple of months..This swing is just okay.There are equally as functional swings, even better I would say, for much cheaper.You are definetly paying for looks when it comes to this swing.I had an old swing from my first child that broke and we replaced it with this one.The mobile on this one doesn't move, which is ridiculous for the price of this swing.Also, the motor is very loud, louder than my swing that was over 2 years old.However, it's such a bummer that the mobile doesn't move, it's pretty much useless, my daughter loved her old mobile and never looks at this one.The turtle is worthless, all you can see is a brown underbelly and small green legs, what fun is that to look at?I appreciate the fact that is does not have a tray like our old swing because my daughter used to kick it up all the time and I was always afraid she would get her finger pinched.It functions (loudly) as a swing, it seems comfortable, and the removeable seat is nice.I absolutely love this swing!I had initially bought her another FP swing and it broke the second day I used it.They refunded me the entire amount and I decided to invest in this one.I would seriously pay full price if I had to.It was not difficult to assemble as others have stated.The only thing I wish is that the seat was a little less reclined.but other than that, this has been a lifesaver.We waited until our son was 4 weeks old before assembling this swing.We chose to use the battery function because we're overseas and don't want to plug this into an adapter.Actually, the battery function sold us on this swing when deciding on a purchase.I like that the base snaps out and you can choose whether to have it swing side to side or top to bottom.You can also just snap it out and place the main seat area on the floor.It comes with a buckle to strap the little one in, and a built in 'cover'.I like the songs and environmental sounds, they are decent and not annoying.I love my new swing, and so does my baby.The design is beautiful, and we never have to spend money buying giant D batteries every couple of weeks like we used to.When my baby was born, a friend loaned me this swing.The baby always fell asleep in it within minutes.I really missed it once we returned it to the owner.The only drawbacks were: the seat size - pretty small, so our baby outgrew it within a few months.Also the mobile didn't move on its own.The seat can also be used independently of the swing.There is just to much to this toy.His ears, trunk and the ends of his legs crinkle.I think it was plenty worth the $10 or $11 I spent on it!I would buy it again!We gave this to my son for Christmas when he was 3 months.This is the toy I reach for now when he's bored.It seems to entertain him the longest with different textures to feel and things to grab.I use this daily to pump milk for my son while I'm at work.Make sure you get 2 sets for the pump adaptors attachments.I like these for basically the same reason everyone else does!They are super easy for both feeding and pumping.If I am storing more than 6 bags of milk at a time, I use the trick of freezing them lid-side-up and then moving the frozen bag to a Ziplock freezer bag so I can re-use the storage disks.This kit works great with my Medela pump in style.I like that I can use both, and that both can use the same nipple.Our daughter has never had any issues transitioning between breast and bottle.You don't have to use the bottle rings, as they fit right on the adapter.Just remove the bottle from the adapter ring after pumping, put the sealing disc on, and store until feeding.I've found that the storage kits (deluxe kit and the ones in the permium nurser gift set) including sealing discs that are the flimsy silicone pieces that fit into the nipple ring work better with the Ventaires than the sealing discs in this kit.We've had a few leak from the top when mixing (we have to add some prune juice for our daughter) a bottle with the hard top sealing disc.We store these bottles on their bottom in the fridge, and have never had a problem with leaks.So really, if you like a reusuable bottle I would recommend looking for the deluxe/premium storage kit.The biggest pro to DROPINS is storage space.All you really need is one holder.When using this kit, milk never touches the holder.Put the liner in the bottle ring, screw on the adapter ring, and pump.It's hard to find the regular 8oz.liners anymore, but they 'stand' better when storing if the liner size correlates closely to the amount of milk stored.We warm up the milk before putting it in the holder.It only takes a few minutes since liners are thinner than a reusuable bottle, and whalaa (NO NEED FOR A BOTTLE WARMER!The only con to dropins is the need to buy liners again and again, but if you only use bottles occasionally this really isn't that big of a deal.My daughter is 7 months old, and we've only used about 3 boxes (100ct.).This systems also works good for freezing breast milk.So far I haven't had any problems with leaks.Also, If I have extra milk but don't want an entire feeding amount froze, I freeze it in an ice cube tray, and store in Ziploc freezer bags.This system has turned out great for if lil' one finishes her bottle and is still hungry but doesn't need another entire feeding, just put a cube or two in...no wasted milk!OVERALL, THIS KIT AND EITHER TYPE OF BOTTLE IS A GREAT CHOICE FOR THE BREASTFEEDING MOM WHO CAN'T BE READILY AVAILABLE 24/7 :)I bought a kit while pumping for my first baby, and used it all the time, but it only came with one pump adapter.When I ordered this one for my second, I was pleasantly surprised to see it came with two pump adapters.And pumping directly into the liners saves a couple extra steps (and unnecessary bottle washing!).If you're pumping a lot, I definitely recommend this.I'm mixed on my opinion of these.Conceptually, really good idea.It is really convienent to freeze, thaw and use the same bag....also MUCH cheaper.I too freeze them in the rings, and then remove and store in a freezer bag.Again, saves a lot of money over other milk storage systems.However, I have had problems with them tearing or leaking in the process.I have tried several different liners (Playtex and several store brand liners).I finally found a store brand liner that reduces the tears and leakage, but not 100% solved.Whoever said no crying over spilled milk, clearly never spilled any breast milk!My baby is now on a 6 oz bottle, and I have about a month's supply of 4 oz bottles.Therefore, you end up using 3 liners for every larger bottle (2 4 oz liners and 1 8 oz liner).Overall, this is still less than the milk storage ziplocks.been using these for 9 months or so to feed pumped breastmilk.baby's never had a gas issue, which could be due to these.FYI, you don't need more than one drop-in nurser (bottle).I exclusively pump for my baby using the Lansinoh breast pump.I really wanted to be able to pump directly into the Playtex drop-ins so I purchased two of these kits (two kits are necessary if you double pump.)It has made my pumping so much easier as I don't have to worry about transferring the milk from collection bottles into the drop-ins and I don't have to rewash the collection bottles after each pump.However, the storage seals never worked for me.They leaked about 75% of the time I used them.After having several ounces of breast milk leak out of the bags a few times, I gave up on using them.At that point, I just bought extra bottles and nipples and just stored the milk directly in the bottles.I still am glad I purchased this kit, and for the price, I don't feel too put out that the storage seals did not work.I advise purchasing this kit solely for the pumping adapters.I am a working mom with a 3 month old who stays with my mother-in-law during the day.I have an Ameda purely yours breast pump, which works just fine with this system.I was freezing my expressed milk in lasinoh breast milk freezer bags, but they are a pain to pour out of (spill easily), and they are not really that space saving in the freezer, even freezing them flat.I wanted a more conveniet system for my MIL for thawing/feeding, and I wanted something more convenient for pumping at work.Pumping directly into the drop-ins works well, as far as attaching them to the pump.However, I still have to pump into regular bottles once and pour into the drop-ins as well, because I don't always have 4oz in each breast to pump out!I do put saran wrap over the the top of the drop in before screwing down the seal though, so that the milk will not be exposed once the seal comes off.The bottles seem to agree more with my son, who suffers from colic/gas, and he switches more easily between playtex nursers and breastfeeding than he did with the Nuk bottles we were using before.In short, I'd recommend this system for feeding because:  it is really convenient for my mil to pop one our of the freezer and thaw it, and have it ready to go with no pouring and no mess; it keeps her from over-feeding him - I only freeze in 4oz servings, and it keeps her from keeping unused portions in the fridge and feeding them to him throughout the day; and it also reduced air-intake and produced a smoother feeding session because he liked the nipple more.It is not more convenient for pumping purposes, but it is no more of a hassle than just plain bottles either.We can't say enough good things about this carseat.We have replaced all of our others with this one, even our Britax ones.Love the built in cup holder and side compartments.Less spilled milk than before.I bought this car seat because my 5 year old with Autism had reached the max weight limit on his other car seat, and isn't ready for a booster.It is not too heavy, and was quite easy to install.My son loves the cup holder for holding his drink, and the secret compartments to store his cars.He is 40.5 lbs and 43 inches.I was all set to buy the Graco Nautilus carseat, but was still wondering if Britax Frontier 85 might be better.Both carseats were not being sold in any stores for me to go and check them out, so I decided to order both and test them out.I am SO glad I did, because in comparison, the Britax was BY FAR the better seat!And believe me, I REALLY wanted to love the Graco seat.640 people probably didn't do a side-by-side comparison of the Graco Nautilus and Britax Frontier 85.I would recommend to anyone to pay $100 more for the Britax Frontier 85, cause you get so much more in the long run!Here's why:1.On the Britax Frontier 85, the furthest crotch slot is 8.5 inches!With the Britax, he has plenty of room to grow and most likely will not be sitting on the crotch strap!2.When I put my son in the Graco Nautilus, my son was hunchback and screaming cause the seat or headrest pushed his head forward and curved his spine.That totally made me question how it would affect his developing posture.In the Britax Frontier 85, his back and head were straight and aligned (no curving of the spine) and no screaming.3.The material on the Graco Nautilus is awful!The seat is rigid and feels like sand paper/cardboard!The harness strap on the Graco Nautilus is kinda short when pulled to the limit and doesn't look like there's much room to grow in it.Pretty disappointing when they claim a child can be harnessed up to 65 lbs!I am 5'1 and 105 lbs, and I was able to sit comfortably in the Britax and strap myself in harnessed no problem!That is phenomenal!!!He owns almost everything Graco.But this seat is RIDICULOUS!It's like they didn't even test it out on real children.How hard is it to make a longer harness strap and an extra crotch slot?And when he sits in it in the house, he doesn't squirm or scream (like he did in the Graco Nautilus).I returned the Graco Nautilus ASAP!The older one needed a new seat because the straps of her old one was getting twisted and also would come undone.This meant 2 new car seats at the same time.We ended up buying 2 of these hoping they will be the last ones we buy for them.My initial reaction to it is that I love it.I love how the slip covers come off, just some elastic loops hooked around plastic hooks.This means I'll be able to fix it myself if one of the elastic loops breaks.The older ones car seat slip cover started coming off and a plastic piece broke.The drink holder location is exactly what I wanted - again the old one had it on the side and having two car seats side by side (one front and one rear facing) we had to remove the drink holder.One note is that it's heavy!We've done a lot of traveling this year and I'm so glad we weren't lugging this thing around with us!If you are transferring the car seat make a note of the weight of it.The younger one sat in it after we put it together and I can tell she's going to fit well in in.And the price was right!Update after a couple of weeks: still like the car seat.The only thing I didn't like was the liner that sits inside the seat.I removed the liner and problem solved.They are in excellent condition, have cleaned up well from all the messes.It's more difficult to unbuckle the chest one which is a good thing because my 2 older ones can undo theirs which isn't a problem since they no not to do it.My 3rd watches everything they do of course and she is not able to unbuckle it!The crotch buckle is also more difficult but once I got the hang of it, it's not a big deal.All are able to sit cross legged in their seats, have toys in the side pocket etc.My now 3yo had same problem until she grew.I am definitely getting my moneys worth out of this pillow.I can't imagine feeding without it.I haven't tried other products to compare it with though.My back does get a little sore, but I have underlying back problems.So far she is comfy, and generally I am too.We are using it now that she is 2 months to help her with tummy time which is nice.Worth the money for sure.A pillow like this is a must-have.!1) can be used for various breastfeeding positions, extremely comfortable for both Mom & Baby2) this slipcover is SO soft and washes well (have washed mine 4-5 times so far and it's still soft/like new)3) can be used to sit baby in for playtime or when bottle feeding (I also use it for a different take on tummy time)Top quality product - definitely recommend!I made it 5 mo.with just one boppy cover but decided having a back up would be helpful.The last thing you want to do is use the boppy bare with no cover.This boa cover is very soft and fits the boppy great.It does hold heat so I find if the room is warm and my son is dressed in his sleep sack it gets hot nursing him.I LOVE the organic cover with the pea pod on it- that one is my favorite.I have not had any problems with it in the wash, or after washing.This isn't a real complaint, though.I've read other reviews of Boppy covers in which people complain about the zipper placement, but I don't have any problems with the placement at all.In fact, I can't even think of anywhere better to put the zipper.Great product, I love this soft cover!it is safe, simple, comfortable and cheap.has two settings -- for awake sitting and sleeping (recline)one downside, which is in almost all other toddler car seats is that there is no hood to put down when the baby wants to sleep/ reduce the light on her face (like there is in a stroller)This car seat is good quality and the material is nice.Installation was easy.However the seats in my jeep liberty are shaped angled to the back of the car and this car seat wont adjust for that.The car seat wont work facing backwards.It becomes to strait and my daughters feet hit the the seat.I'm thinking that isn't too safe.Other people have covered the good safety aspects of this seat, and the fact that it works for newborns up to 40lb, so I'm not going to go into that.I've been using this as rear-facing for 15 months now.It has to be positioned in the center seat, otherwise there's not enough clearance behind the seats, but that's the safest position for a carseat anyway.My main criticism is that while the seat is rear-facing it's very difficult to tighten the straps to fit snugly, if you've previously loosened them for thicker clothes or different diapers (we use both cloth and disposable diapers, and it does make a difference for fit).There's a button you hold down while you pull a central strap, and both are located in the center under the baby's feet.Which, when rear-facing, means the base of the carseat is pressed against the seat and there is barely any clearance for your fingers.Overall a winner since the price is a fraction of other recommended products.It worked out great.A few things I don't like about are the bottom buckle is a bit tight to release, the seat cover is not as padded and soft as the Graco seat we have in our main vehicle.Considering I paid $30 for this seat, it's not bad.Compared to the Combi Cocorro my wife, mother-in-law and father use in their cars, this Cosco seat is pretty clunky.Clunky?Yeah, lack of padding, cheap plastic feel, notchy belt action -- you know, cheap!But my son (now nearly 18 months) has spent a lot of time in this seat over the past 6 or 7 months, and not once has indicated he's uncomfortable in it, and has no problem nodding off when he's sleepy.So the lack of padding is a non-issue.My biggest criticism is the belt system.The cover has been through the wash, but its removal requires a complete disconnect/disassembly of the main seat belt, which is a serpentine affair which loops through four separate notches in the seat as well as six buckles, without a complete diagram in the included instruction manual for reassembly.My original comments all stand, but again, my toddler (now 2 years 3 months) has never expressed one iota of discomfort due to the light padding.Hence, I've upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars "I Like It."I just wish the straps worked with a bit less friction, because it's still a bit of a challenge to get everything snugged down correctly.Yes, I admit I bought this because of the color- Lime Green.It matches my 3yo's Safety 1st High Back Booster.This car seat is pretty much impossible to tighten properly, and I know what I'm doing.For some reason this thing will not get tight, and I have a Ford Focus people, I don't have a lot of room to maneuver, but it has always been more than adequate for my other seats.The level (if that is what you call it) isn't a ball like most seats have, it is just a flat place on the bottom that tells you to keep it level to the ground.Well, that is easier said than done, first of all it isn't sitting on the ground, second, the curve of the seat makes that hard.I don't worry at all about my other daughter in her seat, it is like a rock-that puppy isn't going anywhere.I welcome any suggestions about getting this seat tighter and more level......I have a rolled up towel under the front of it.My primary car seats are Britax Roundabout 50s.Comparing those to these is like comparing a Mercedes to a Kia, but these Cosco seats are perfectly adequate for my second car that I use for quick trips to the store on weekends and sometimes for short trips to or from daycare during the week.When I tried putting a pool noodle under the front to recline them more, we couldn't get the latch straps tight enough.I looked at a couple of Sceneras in a Target store that were cheaper than the pair I ultimately bought here at Amazon.The Target seats had no padding in them at all and had really cheap fabric.The seats I bought from Amazon were, I think, $10 or $15 more expensive but have nicer fabric and extra padding.I bought two of these for a friend of mine who I babysit for frequently.I wanted SAFE so I instantly thought "Britax".Not the case!I was thrilled to find these at the TOP of the list for safety ratings at Consumer Reports.I am thrilled to report that although these do not come with all the bells and whistles, they are indeed everything they claim to be.I would describe them as "tolerable" but not much better.I found it virtually impossible to get a tight fit in the car.Getting the shoulder straps even is also sometimes a challenge; sometimes you get one shoulder strap that's much tighter than the other side.We'll probably use the seats again when we fly (since I won't care much if the airline damages them!In Vegas this thing comes in soooooo handy.It's saved our little one from a burned bum many times.The only problem is that sometimes we forget to use it.Especially the metal pieces don't get hot in the southern California sunMy daughter's car seat (with this cover over it) had direct sunlight (90 degrees outside) coming in the window for an hour while we shopped and when we got back in the metal and plastic parts of her car seat were only warm, not hot to the touch so I didn't have to run the AC to cool off the car before putting her in the seat.Just what I wanted.Sometimes it's hard to put a child into a car seat to begin with.To put a child into a scorching hot car seat is even more difficult.This product eliminates that latter situation: at least the car seat isn't too hot!This won't say that the seat will be cold -- it will be significantly cooler than if left in direct sunlight, but it won't be chilled.All in all, good few bucks for a product that is easy-to-use and useful.The two pieces just snap together, so if you pull on one piece hard enough it will also pull apart.To say this is the best doorknob cover we've found isn't really saying much.Most are either adult-proof or useless.It's a little awkward to stick your fingers through the holes in the side (especially since we have weird, narrow doorknobs), but it can be done without much effort.They're reasonably easy to put on your doors (again, this is compared to some of the others we've tried, which sets a low bar), and our toddler has yet to have the slightest success in removing them.I needed more outlet covers but these are too loose.They can be pulled out and the babies enjoy doing it.Pro - This is a very good price for the 4 door knob covers & cabinet latches; which work really well.Con - You will have to spend another $4 and buy better outlet covers.Of course, the outlet covers we purchased to replace them were of the same Safety 1st brand - only one at the store at the time.The new ones fit very tightly; making it a challenge for even adult fingers.It's very well designed and it really does help that the baby can see the liquid as he's drinking.It was key in helping our son to control the fluid as he tilted, he totally looked down and watched it.I would have thought this was a gimmick but a friend recommended it and I'm really glad we tried it.This is a good diaper bag.It is pretty big so you can fit all of your baby needs inside of it.This product ended up being even better than I expected.So we got this seat and now our toilet works easily for the whole family.The quality was great, not "cheapo" at all and she loves it.His bottom would fall in the hole.It does not stay up well.It will free fall from 12 O'clock to 2 before it slows.*This has a little to do with the toilet design as the tank face is not flat.**(This is truly a issue for the times you do not wish to sit down.)3.The seat is designed to look nice.In doing this they made it very thick.I think it could be 1/2" thinner.This adds to the #2 issue.4.This being a plastic seat that was included "OEM" with the toilet.5.The child seat lid needs to be slow close as well.The weight gives it a good loud smack when it gets dropped.It needs to just be a lid you put on over your existing toilet.The adult portion feels like you are sitting on the rim, it's horribly uncomfortable.The toddler portion doesn't stay up, so you have to go with it leaning on your back.The adult portion, doesn't stay up at all, so my husband can't use it.Buy this and you will be hoooked!They are soft, durable, and stylish!I actually didn't discover these until my son was a few weeks old already and he didn't really care to be swaddled, so I used them as blankets.I love using them for the car seat too.I know others who've used them to cover up when they're nursing (or pumping.)I've purchased these for others who are having babies.I wish they were cheaper, but these are definitely well worth the money.They are light enough that he doesn't overheat even when riding in the car.They are handy for spit up messes and they always come clean.The size and the stretch made them perfect for swaddling.However, the first time I put one in the dryer, it came out very pilled and slightly misshapen- hence the 4 stars.The material is muslin and didn't do well in the dryer.We used 4 of them in heavy rotation during our daughter's first 6 months and they held up really well- but I hung them to dry.And actually, hanging them to dry is no big deal, because they came out of the washing machine almost dry already!The fabric is thin and dries really fast.Her baby was very content while swaddled in this blanket.It took me a while to finally find them.I also love the fact that it's very breathable so you don't need to worry too much about SID even if the baby's face is covered by it.My baby covers her face completely with this blanket and is fine.I love the fact that it is large enouge to swaddle a bigger baby.Also since it's light weight, it deosn't slip down from baby's body like most other blankets do.All and all, these by far are my baby's favorite blankies.I and my baby can't live without them.Actually, we love all the Aden + Anais products we have ever purchased.These wraps are a great quality product.Having a newborn who spits up we have washed them several times and they only become softer and softer!Buy them!I would recommend this to friends and give as gifts!By the second night home from the hospital with our DD we realized (or should I say we were loudly informed by our daughter)that we didn't have any blankets adequate for swaddling.We live an hour from the nearest baby store, and I was recovering from a c-section-- Amazon to the rescue!!Beautiful material, though a bit on the thin side.Shipped promptly.Wondering if you should buy the a+a line or buy aden + anais for amazon, Target, Toys'rus or little77?Well, I bought a+a for Target and little77 and they DO NOT come close to these.I wanted to save $10 and bought them at Target and now that I have some of the original ones at home, I wish I had invested in them straight from the beginning.***EDIT**** 9 Jan 2012I just saw that now they have added cheaper ones for $35 among the original sized ones listed above - beware those showing up for the original price of $35 are smaller - you can see this under the product information.They are 44 x 44 and not the regular 47 x 47.The ones with the original price of $49.95 are the boutique and much nicer ones!Fold them in half and swaddle away!Buy two sets (8 blankets) and call it good.Make sure you buy the original kind (47' x 47') and not the version that Target or Babies R Us sells.The Target & Babies R Us versions are less expensive.But they are also slightly smaller and not quite so soft.With the price on the original version decreasing, there is really no reason to get the Target version anymore.I use them for EVERYTHING: swaddling, sun shade, light blanket, nursing cover, play mat, burp cloth...They are light enough to keep two with you in the car or diaper bag and you're all set for whatever the day throws at you and your baby.These were one of my most useful and long term baby purchases.These are my favorite all purpose blankets!I always have one on me!They are nice and light.Not good for swaddling on a small baby - it's too big for that, as it stretches and can be cumbersome to swaddle with.Some come with nice wrinkling and the others without the nice wrinkles in it.When my son was smaller we used these to put him down on the floor and a few times I used it as a nursing cover.When he reached 12 months we started letting him use these to sleep with.Now that he's discovered he can put a blanket over his head I don't have to worry that he can't breathe.After our 4 week old outgrew his hospital swaddle blankets, these were perfect to switch to and they're more comfortable when the room warmed up in the spring.So glad we invested in these.I would definitely buy again if we needed more.I washed them three times before the first use and they are still beautiful!I'm so glad I purchased these.Since they're so generously sized, I use it as a nursing cover when breastfeeding.Even though I really don't need any more than four, I'm tempted to buy one more in another cute pattern.If this original line is too expensive, you could get the A+A for target line.This is a neat concept with horrible execution.The positive is bright colors and size of mat is good for door jumper.It is so loud I had to put a towel over the speaker.2- The individual sounds are not that horrible, though not that desirable either.The problem is they go off all together regardless of where you touch the thing- it is very chaotic like putting three toys on at one time.My 6-month-old hates it and he was scared by the volume.He likes the crinkly sound it makes when he jumps with the sound turned off, but I could put a paper bag under the jumper for free.I think that this cup is a great concept for teaching a young child to drink from a cup with less mess.They are perfectly portioned to store baby food in the fridge or diaper bag.I make my own food and store it in these and store snacks in them when we're on the go.These bowls are the small enough that they don't take up a lot of room in a diaper bag but also large enough that you can put a perfect portion of dry rice cereal in them.They also have actually become a backup toy when he gets a little bored or cranky while being out.These bowls are a must have for any diaper bag.We liked that it was on wheels and could fit through door ways.I was sure I had left a positive review of this thing and wanted to come delete it.It looks like I never bothered to review it and I am glad that I am just now reviewing it as I've had it for a while (my son is now 16+ months) & grown to hate this thing.You'd think for 800$ it would stay together!If you decide to buy it anyway you can find inexpensive & unique sheets (sans bumper) on etsy.comEdit: So I contacted Stokke about the screws coming out and they said that it is expected of me to regularly maintain by tightening the screws.The foot print in the Ikea crib isn't much bigger.DO NOT BUY THIS.For 800$ you can get 8 cribs that are better.Just took my 1-year old on a 1-hour flight with this.Worked out very well.I've read the other reviews...ignore them.Get a dining room chair.Practice strapping the seat strap, adjusting the over-the-shoulder straps, and learn how to buckle both the center chest strap and pass the seatbelt through the bottom loops.(Use a surrogate for the belt - i used the belt I wear every day to stand in the place of the airline's seatbelt).Do this 5 times.Then try it with your child in place.Took me 30 seconds once I got good at it.It works FINE on both a closed and open tray table.If it is a VERY recessed tray table, it takes only a little force to get it to latch...remember, these airline tray table latches aren't hardened steel...they are plastic, and have a lot of give.My child is normal size.The seatbelt section worked easily, tightened well.Only problem was with the snugness of the over-the-shoulder straps.I got them pretty much to their max tightness, but there was some wiggle room.Nothing to worry about.If your child is gigantic, this will work.It can handle the biggest of the big.He never slid out of the bottom, even though there was no between-the-legs strap to hold him in place.The worst thing that happened was that he tended to slump to one side, which annoyed him at times.Just had to prop him back up.Takeoff and landing was simple.Take them out a couple times during the flight, stretch them out.I think it's less of a safety device, more of a "try to corral your kid in the seat" device that allows travel without the clunky, giant car seat."But he was in an FAA approved child restraint...not our fault!".Everyone wins...4 Stars - I LIKE THIS PRODUCT!I would have given it 5 stars, but for the price (it is expensive), I couldn't justify the best rating...I didn't want to, nor would I reasonably be able to, lug a car seat on & off the plane while carrying 2 littleones and my carry-on.It was easy to put on, easy to take off, stored well, and made my life much easier.I only wish that I had a neck pillow for when my 2yr old fell asleep.I can not tell you just how much we honestly love this product.We recently brought his car seat on board for a red eye thinking that he would find the car seat more comfortable to sleep in, but he was really upset to be in his car seat and wanted to be in this instead.On the return flight we checked the car seat and used this and he had a much easier time getting comfortable.This product was purchased almost a year ago, but we opted to carry our very sturdy (and very heavy) carseat with us in stead- in hopes that our 18-month old would nap.a year later I traveld with our now 2.5 yr old and knew I didnt want to lug the car seat plus all the gear by myself, so I brought this product along and prayed it allowed for napping and comfort.My son fell asleep on the second flight and he said he felt like a "bog boy" in his big seat.I have a very young baby and these really clean up those messy diapers very well.I never need more than two unless I miss a spot.They really grab and keep my daughter clean.Oh and when I squirt them with the solution they instantly absorb it so no problems with absorbency.After much deliberation and reading reviews, we decided on this walker for our grandson because of the durability and darling "toy factor".We're confident he'll be pushing it around the house in a few weeks - promises years of fun!This was the BEST sippy EVER!!!No leaks, no mess, soft nipple for chewing, teething, easy sucking.He didnt like the handles, so we took them off and he learned to hold a cup earlier since the cup is small enough so they can grip the middle.Cannot say enough good about this!i bought this product just because it is BPA free over a year ago.I have about 6 brands I've tried.My daughter has been tough transitioning from a nipple to a hard plastic sippy lid.It would be hands down my favorite, but this is what holds my rating to 4 stars:Travel sealing discs are not included standard, they have to be purchased separately.These are essential for putting the cup in a diaper bag.They should be included.When my daughter drinks out of this, sometimes the nipple implodes on itself because she's sucked out all the air.I have never purchased anything else from this brand but thought it looked nice and the reviews were good so I added it to my registry.I have used it for 8, going on 9 months now and it has worked out great.It isn't too big for those quick trips and is just right for those overnighter's.My only issue is that the stitching is starting to unravel from the zipper - where it meets the bag.Nothing that a quick stitch job won't fix.Other than that I love the bag and would recommend it to all.I love the green pattern!It is sort of a light sage with a paisley pattern.Love the my brest friend pillow too, despite the silly name.The one negative about this pillow/slipcover is that it is sort of a pain to put the cover back on.The first couple of times I had to wash it and put it back on, I found it very confusing to try to figure out how it fit.Also, the instructions say not to put it in the dryer, which I find silly.When you have a newborn, it's easy to accidentally throw it in the dryer with the rest of the load.We have done that a couple of times and thought we shrunk it, but it does still seem to fit.My favorite PUL wraps are Bummis Super Whisper Wraps.This wrap is my second favorite.It is comparable in structure to the classic Thirsties wrap, but I find this one superior.Wiping pee/poo off the PUL minicleans the wrap, extending usage.I have no experienced any smell issues, staining, pilling, or wicking with this cover.However in the same length of time (one moth for this size, four months total), my bummis have held up much better.Wash with my prefolds (cold water and vinegar prewash, hot water and All free and clear with no brighteners, and a second rinse).I occasionally tumble dry them, but usually line dry indoors since it is winter.This is a wonderful cover in combination with a cotton prefold.I can also use a hemp doubler for naps with NO fit issues.Only four stars because I like the SWW even more!I wish I would have NEVER bought this chair.I will explain the good, the bad, and the ugly truth of this high chair.(tray has not though)The First Years did tell me that this high chair is BPA free!It does recline, I don't have the strength to recline it but my husband can for me.THE BADIf your dining room set has arm rest do NOT buy this chair.I have washed the cover multiple times and tried to get it to be less scratchy.THE UGLYFood gets stuck everywhere!This chair is by far the most impossible ones to clean.Only 3 point harness not good for little ones at all!(NEEDS A 5 POINT)Because you use your own wooden chair you have to clean your wooden chair every other week because food gets stuck on a persons nice dining room chair.The food gets stuck under it and you have to take it off your wooden dining room chair and clean that along with cleaning this chair too.Also my nine month old is getting to tall for this high chair.I have to buy another one as his head is almost touching where the dining room chair is.At six months of age my child could take OFF the tray.YUP!At six months of age I stopped using this high chair.My child's arms got stuck.I have used other high chairs where this does not happen.My child used to walk over to it and rip out the attachment on the back of the chair and play with the very long straps it has on it.Once put together you CAN NOT take it apart!I am unable to use this unsafe chair.I was thinking of getting the boon one instead with a 50 pound weight limit and wheels!The entire cover comes off for easy cleaning in the washer machine.There are two MAJOR negatives for me about this car seat.First, as other users have stated, the handle does not move easily and is very loud and squeaky, which is just a nightmare when you have a sleeping baby.This is a huge problem as your baby grows, especially if you use a "bundle me" (which EVERY mom I know uses in a cold climate) or if your baby is wearing any bulky clothing, or a cloth diaper.My baby is 18 pounds and 27 inches at 5 months and my baby has already out-grown this car seat for this reason.I would have loved to be able to have used it through the winter, so this is a huge disappointment and the main reason why I would never buy again!We chose the Graco Snugride Infant Car Seat in Platinum because we thought it would be a shade of silver or gray with black.The color is actually beige with black, which is why I only gave this seat 4 stars.We decided on the Snugride in Platinum because of its neutral tones and good reviews, and I liked the fact that it includes a foot muff for cooler weather.(That took about five minutes.)The sun shade seems a teeny bit flimsy and the material of the foot muff seems likely to snag on Velcro or other rough materials, but so far we haven't had any problems with either.The 5-point harness, albeit super-safe, is a little cumbersome next to a baby body, but we've remedied that with soft strap covers and our baby doesn't seem to be bothered much by it, and snuggles right into his seat when we travel.I find the seat to be fairly light to carry, and have even lifted it without straining or hurting myself within a week of having a C-section.There are a lot of trendy and pricey car seats on the market, but Graco is a trustworthy and reliable brand that offers a great product that we've been very happy with, for a fraction of the cost of other car seat manufacturers.This mat has too many pieces.If you get it for your little one to play on, you'll be forever putting together all the little bits and pieces, which are likely choking hazards anyway.Get a mat that's all one piece.This mat  is great for a baby that is just learning to crawl or is sitting up.Its soft enough to not heart your baby in case he/she falls and hard enough for baby to be able to crawl and roll over easily.I highly recommend this mat.we spend pretty much all the time on this carpet while we are indoors.Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has.We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his "wubbas" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable.Even with all of the little accidents that have occurred on it, it still looks brand new.I highly recommend this product.At first, before baby arrived, my husband didn't see how these would be so essential, but he quickly changed his mind the first week w/ our newborn son.I bought this for use under my baby when he sleeps in our bed.Keeps accidents off of our bed.She takes naps on them when she is on our bed, I line her changing table with them, her mosses basket was lined with one, I keep on in the car for those occasions when she needs to take a nap somewhere other than her own bed.I love that they are vinyl free and organic cotton.Meaning I can't really use these under sheets on her bed, or in the pack n plays, nor can I travel with them.Go figure.Exactly what I wanted, thicker than I thought!Didn't smell like any sort of chemical out of package.Washed great!!I'll be buying another!I have only had to wash it once so far because it normally doesn't get wet but I was impressed with how it kept the pad totally dry.I airdried it and it wasn't quite as soft as before but other than that, great product!Pills a bit after washing but it doesnt really matter cause you put a sheet on top.It's waterproof, soft and thick.I purchased this for this purpose, so worked for me, but wouldn't want anyone to feel like this is a "step up" for their baby.I looked at the Maclaren organizer, but decided against it when I saw this product which seemed so similar, as well as cheaper.I also saw that several people preferred this organizer over the Maclaren.So I gave it a chance.The organizer itself seems fine, there are several zip compartments where you could put all kinds of stuff- cell phone, keys, diapers, etc if you were so inclined.Also, with the Maclaren's handles open the way they are, I would just loop a bag around the stroller handle rather than attach it by a little 'biner.But that's just me.The important thing was the cupholders.Several reviewers said that the cupholders were big enough to hold their waterbottles and that they worked great as long as the container had a lid.My "cups" of choice are a Klean Kanteen waterbottle 18 oz and a coffee mug from Starbucks- 16oz but tall and skinny.Both these fit into a standard cupholder in a car or what have you.The tops of the cupholders are elasticised, meaning that you need two hands to wrestle pretty much any cup into (or out of) them.The coffee mug does have a pretty beefy seal to prevent spills, but it's not completely leak proof and at the angle it was resting at I though it might leak even with the sip hole sealed.This and the difficulty getting cups in and out made this organizer worthless to me.I recently saw in person the Sunshine Kids stroller organizer, and was amazed at how great it looked in person.Plus, it's half the price.I just returned my JL Childress organizer and will be buying the Sunshine Kids one.Can't wait to go to the zoo with my coffee.I guess if you are planning to use this organizer for a couple diapers, 2 baby bottles, and cell phone, lip balm etc,  this organizer is good.But if you want to hold water bottles or sippy cups, look elsewhere.The carry you milan organizer is much nicer for that purpose.The refills are fine, but when I discovered trash bags work just as well, I abandoned the refills!Very cute cups for being semi-disposable.Good price, not meant to be an investment but good for travel and it won't bug you so much to lose one here or there.Would recommend leaving some at the aunt/uncle/grandparents/close friend's houses so your always covered!How much you will like these bumpers depends what you want them to do and how much your baby moves.I got these bumpers when my daughter was about 6 months old.I had previously purchased a bedding set that came with traditional padded bumpers.For the first 4-5 months or so, she didn't really move all that much, so the bumpers didn't really serve any purpose.But once she started really moving around the crib at night I ran into two opposing problems.Sometimes she would end up with her face in the bumper, which would scare the heck out of me so I took the bumpers off.But then she would get her arms and legs stuck through the slats of the crib.So I would put the bumpers back on, but end up worrying about smothering.I was looking for something that would solve these problems and the breathable bumpers did the trick.I no longer worried about airflow or smothering, and her arms and legs were kept inside the crib.I've been happy enough with these bumpers, but they are a little difficult to get on tightly.And they are easily collapsible, so baby can throw an arm or leg over top of one, if they are so coordinated or lucky.These are definitely not going to keep baby from whacking a head against a side, so if that is your problem, these bumpers won't help- they are not padded.I think these are a good buy for people in my situation- baby likes to stick limbs through the slats, but you worry about airflow.But they have worked well for me.Fits well and protects against limbs that get out of the crib and could get hurt.And won't suffocate if the baby rolls over and ends up facing this protection.I agree with other reviewers that one negative aspect of this bumper is that its really light and baby can easily pull it down.I folded it in half and tried breathing through it myself (crazy mom moment, yes, I admit to it) and air flows thru it uber easily even when folded in two.I usually sneak in after she's asleep and slide it back into place so she doesn't get her feet stuck btw the slats while sleeping, which is why I bought it.Also its really soft.I wanted so badly for this to be the end all, be all.But, after putting it together, I realize it wasn't long enough to cover the entire crib.And we have standard crib.That was disappointing.Then, we realized that this bumper provides little to no padding for if your baby hits her head against it which is inevitable when they're learning to sit or even, when they're learning to roll and wiggle up and down the crib.It's unfortunate, but I'm thinking about buying a regular crib bumper.Although my 8 month old still puts her feet above this bumper, she doesn't get her feet stuck in the slats as she did with our traditional bumper.I was sold on this when I read the review about not having to untie all the strings for the bumper in order to change/wash the sheets.I was pleasantly suprised to feel how softly padded this bumper is.If she does happen to have a crazy night of sleeping and shuffles it around a bit, I just simply re-velcro it back.Eventually she will move into her own room and a full size crib and this will fit fine I am sure.All and all, I do love this product, and I am going to recommend it to all my friends that are having babies, or that have babies and would like a nice alternative to the standard-tie-bumper.They helped initially, when she was younger and wasn't as strong (when she'd slightly hit her head).But when she got to about 7 or 8 months and she started rocking back and forth on her hands and knees, she would hit her head pretty hard.The Breathable Bumpers provided no padding for that.But my main gripe with these bumpers is that there are only 2 ties on them, one in the front and one in the back.So that leaves the remainder of the bumper fabric unattached to the crib rails, so my daughter is able to push and pull them down with her hands and feet.And because of this, the bumpers are constantly sliding down and out of proper position, and they bunch up against the mattress.They also become too loose and I'm constantly readjusting them.If there were more ties all the way around the bumper, then it would stay flat against the crib.Doesn't take a genius to figure that out.Hopefully someone from the company will see this review and take that into consideration to redesign the bumpers.This product was exactly what we were looking for - we wanted something to keep our 6mo son's legs out between the slats, but that wasn't to thick and wouldn't get in the way of changing the sheets.I was worried that it would look tacky in the room, but it doesn't at all - it looks like a nice baby product.I registered for these since they are the ONLY recommended bumper pads on the market.I liked them immediately after opening the package and washed them B4 putting on the crib.The directions were pictures, which for the most part was easy to follow, but there was one picture that wasn't very clear in what you were supposed to do, so we couldn't get both pieces on correctly.After trying 3 times and redoing them, we finally figured out where we went wrong and got them on right.The only thing I don't like about them is the tie in the middle falls slightly down the slat so they don't lay completely flat.This breathable bumper is a great bumper to get if you are worried about SIDS but still want something around the crib bars to keep your baby's arms and legs in.However, it is just mesh and is not padded at all, so it doesn't offer any cushion if your baby likes to bang into the crib bars with their head or body.I used this bumper until my son was nine months old, at which point I switched to traditional padded bumper, because my son was constantly banging his head into the walls of the crib and waking himself up.So for a breathable bumper, this works great.I had heard a lot of good things about this bumper and REALLY wanted it to work out.Not only did it fit extremely awkwardly around the posts, it left odd gaps, but the main thing was it wasn't even long enough to go around the whole thing.This is a really good idea for a safe bumper, but it just was not practical and clearly doesn't fit all cribs.I bought this because my baby kept getting stuck in the slats and we were worried about her breathing with the regular bumper.She can lay right up against it and no problems.It is also easier to deal with when changing the sheets than the regular bumper.I bought this bumper so that my son's limbs would not get caught in the slats of the crib and so far it has worked.He hasn't been caught up in the crib since we've started using this.The only reason I gave it four stars is because it is slightly scrunched in the front.It doesn't lay particularly flat on the front of the crib, but this is more for aesthetic reasons.It's not loose and does not pose a danger to him, but it's as if it's not exactly straight, if that makes sense.I felt no need to buy a crib bedding set when for safety, children really don't need those blankets or cushy bumpers.I'd buy another!these car seat strap covers are very soft.i am glad i purchased them from amazon.Buy these!I was hoping this product would be a little larger and help keep my babies head from leaning forward when he sleeps, but it doesn't.Bought these for 2 reasons - one to protect the straps when she spits up and the other to make sure the straps don't dig into her when she's in the car seat.Getting her into the seat is a little annoying but I'm sure after doing it a few times it will be easier.Some reviews might complain about the bumpers being to big but note they have changed that...the bumpers shown in the picture are rounded but the ones you get are the flat standard bumpers and fit very nicely.I also purchased the hamper, storage bins, clock, Blanket in Green Velour with Giggles Stripe Ruffle, burp cloths, Messenger Diaper Bag, bear mobile and valances.I would purchase again.The only bad thing I've noticed is the bumper which is a little short from the corners of the crib, but it's hard to notice.Worth the money!I first used the Munchkin White Hot Safety Spoons at my daughter's home when feeding her son.I really liked the shallow spoon bowl which made it much easier for her little one to learn to eat from a spoon.Because he was used to sucking his bottle, the baby spoons with deeper bowls proved to be very frustrating for both baby and adult.We do pay attention to the color change and wait until the spoon stays its original color before feeding heated foods.There has been no problem with the spoons staining, even the lighter colors clean up very nicely in the dishwasher - top shelf, of course.The spoons have been used for broccoli, prunes, yellow squash, green peas and blueberries, so if they were going to stain these foods would have done the trick.Of course, we do rinse them before putting them in the dishwasher, so that may help prevent staining.I would urge those who need baby spoons to consider the Munchkin White Hot Safety Spoon for its helping transition your little one to solid foods.He rejected the silicone Nuk nipples, and the evenflow stage 1 nipple that came with the bottles allowed him to take 2-3 oz much too quickly (in the course of a minute or two), and really weren't slow flow at all.This was the slowest flow of all that we tried, including playtex ventaire and the Nuk silicone.We did not compare to Dr. Brown.I love this breast pump!I was hesitant to buy it after reading mixed reviews, but I'm so glad I did.This pump is so easy to use and clean and so portable.I've never had any spillage and I regularly pump in the passenger seat of the car and while walking around the house.I haven't tried the hands free contraption, but haven't really needed to as the cups stay in position when tucked into my regular nursing bra.Worth every penny!ETA: It's March 2014, and I am using this pump again now that I've had baby #2 after storing it for 3 years.It doesn't hold a battery charge as well (if it's been a few weeks since I've used it, I know I'll have to either plug it in while using it, or plan ahead and charge it), but the suction is still the same.However, when the motor died and left me without a pump I asked Medela to replace it with the Pump In Style Advanced.I have not looked back.Immediately my production jumped by 3 oz/day and it has continued to climb since then.If you are deciding between the two, here is a quick breakdown:Benefits of Freestyle:- Mobile, can diaper baby while pumping- Hoses are easier to plug in and take out- Hoses do not build condensation- Everything I need for a day at work (except a packed lunch) fit easily in bag- Digital display made getting to know your let down cycles easy- Long battery life, short battery recharge- Battery contained within pump unit- Easier to clean with Quick Clean WipesDrawbacks of Freestyle:- Connectors allow direct path for milk to spill if it sloshes while walking/tips once placed on table- Pumping took longer to get same amount of milk as Pump In Style Advanced- Pumping felt harsher, more painful, than Pump In Style Advanced- Turned on with a push button, often came on in bag while walking to work which drained battery- Hands Free setup feels unstable - prefer security of "Easy Expression" (or home made version)- Louder than Pump In Style AdvancedBenefits of Pump In Style Advanced- Higher volume milk production- Accessories in Metro Bag are greatDrawbacks of Pump In Style Advanced- More parts- Connectors difficult to clean with Quick Clean Wipes- Membranes wear out and tear easily, always need a spare set in the bagComments on both Freestyle & Pump In Style- Would prefer to adjust suction and speed independently as with Lactina- Would prefer if "let down" change required you to push the button.Often this happens before I am ready for it and causes a few moments of extreme pain while I reach to re-set the pump.As other reviewers have said, Medela customer service was terrific to deal with but I would have preferred not to have the issue.I really like that this was the top of the line consumer pump but after I bought it I found it cheaper at baby depot (burlington coat factory online) cheaper.I wish Amazon would lower its price on this product.It's hands free and pretty straight forward.I used an old, used Pump in Style (PIS) for my first baby.It worked fine, but I loathed lugging that thing back and forth to work for a full year.For both pumps I did get new tubing and I sterilized all parts before using to try and eliminate any cross-contamination.I have not yet returned to work after having my second baby, but have been pumping now for a month several times a day to build up my supply and for breastmilk storage, and I definitely prefer the Freestyle.The Pros:*Small!No cord!The battery seems to hold a charge for 4+ pumpings of 15+ minutes, and recharges pretty quickly.At work I was pumping in a clockless office and had to look at my watch constantly to check the time- ackward angle while holding the horns to my breasts.Also I like that I can program a preset letdown and suction intensity.The tubing is simple as can be to switch between one or two breasts.The Freestyle parts are easier to clean than the PIS- no matter how hard I tried I couldn't get the PIS parts clean & had mold growing in them.The Freestyle parts have fewer crevices and I have had no mold.The Cons:*I haven't used the hands-free parts but they seem complicated and are unusable to me as I usually wear "sleep" bras that you pull to the side.The woman I bought the pump from hadn't used them either- they are still wrapped in original packaging!I did buy a Made by Moms pumping band which I love as it has a neck band like a halter top.If Medela is going to charge for a hands-free device, it should be more like a band than the mess of parts they include now.I have read that some women aren't able to produce as much milk with the Freestyle as with the PIS.This has not been the case for me, but people do respond differently to pumps, it's unfortunate that we can't try the various pumps before we use them.I don't find the Freestyle to be overly loud, certainly no louder than the PIS which definitley had it's own "song".I also highly reccomend the microwave steam clean bags that Medela sells.I am not a crazy germaphobe, actually somewhat to the contrary, but bought the bags after much deliberation as I am a nurse and pumping at work means potential exposure to lots of nasty germs.I understand that not everyone loves the Freestyle because some pumps just work better for some women, but for me, the Freestyle is a winner!It's a lot smaller to carry back and forth, and is a lot quicker to set up and clean up, making my pumping breaks shorter.I work 12 hour shifts overnight and also pump while my kids are at daycare during the day, effectively pumping exclusively on the days that I work for 3 days in a row.I am finding that with this schedule I am charging the pump every 3 days or so, which seems like a lot of uses between charges.I have noticed that my milk output seems to be down ever so slightly by the 3rd day of work, however this isn't really effecting my overall milk production so isn't a big deal for me.My son goes through a LOT of milk so I am continuing to pump once a day at home to make sure there is enough milk in reserve for him, but honestly I haven't had any supply problems even though I did have supply problems with my first son (I just kept pumping and was able to work through it with him).I guess I'm just being cautious :).Some observations- still no problem with mold in the parts.Really easy to clean.I haven't had a problem with milk spilling but try to be careful to stay upright when pumping.I can eat and pump at the same time, which makes both me and my coworkers who are covering for me happy.I bought a regular lunch-size soft cooler that I put my bottles and the pump in to transport to & from work.Everything stays in the cooler when I'm not actually pumping.Bonus here is my coworkers don't have to look at my bottles of milk in the fridge since they stay in the cooler (something a coworker in the past had complained about).I use the cooler that came with the pump to take milk with my son to daycare.*The microwave steam clean bags are fabulous!I like that I know the parts are clean AND stored all together.*I usually pump directly into the bottles I use to feed (I use Evenflo glass bottles- LOVE them!), but have started storing extra milk in Lanisoh milk storage bags for better space usage- no firm opinion on these yet but having extra milk in bags has been convenient so far.I was going to hang on to my old PIS in case something didn't work out with the Freestyle, but now think I'm going to give it away becuase I know I don't need it anymore!I felt like a prisoner chained to a lead ball while using the pump-in-style.I got the freestyle and I was free again.I also bought a bustier  Simple Wishes Hands Free Pumping Bustier for Medela Breast Pump XS/S/M.Because the pump is really small and light, I could clip it on the bustier, put a robe on to hide the whole contraption, and go about my day doing everything that needed to be done.I don't think I could have used this in public places as some reviewers have noted.A side-by-side comparison of the freestyle (FS) and the pump-in-style (PIS):1.The FS has soft breast shields while the PIS has hard plastic ones.It makes a BIG difference in the level of comfort.3.The FS has much better valves (big) than the PIS (tiny, slipped in the garbage disposal, ripped multiple times).4.The FS has a rechargeable battery which lasts a surprisingly long time (days), so it's truly portable.The PIS is only portable when not being used (although you can use AA batteries).5.The only advantage of the PIS is that the little backpack can be useful to fit all breastfeeding/pumping accessories.Finally, when I brought the PIS along on a plane ride, I was stopped and searched and scanned meticulously because it looked too much like a bomb.I didn't have that same problem with the FS on plane trips (looks more like a gadget rather than a suitcase bomb).I have owned this pump for 7 months now.I love how portable the pump is.I also prefer the larger valve on this pump to the smaller valves on the other medela styles.I love the monitor showing me how long I have pumped for.And the option to switch between the fast pumping and the let down mode.Lastly, I love that it runs on a rechargable battery.I can go at least 2 days without charging it.However, during the past several weeks, my milk supplied has taken a major dip.I spoke with a few lactaction consultants, and companies who rent out medical grade pumps, and the consensus is that this is not the best medela pump and it does not simulate the baby's sucking as well as the pump in style advanced.They say that the pump in style advanced is 'stronger.'They have suggested that I rent a medical grade pump to boost my supply, however, once I go back to exclusively using the freestyle, my supply would probably dip down again.Given that advice, I strongly suggest you speak with other lactaction consultants if you plan to use this pump several times a day while at work or perhaps pump exclusively.And you should look into the pump in style advanced models.I do not regret my choice in this pump since it is so portable and convenient.I have thought about purchasing a pump in style advanced to keep in my office and to use this at home and for travel.At this point though, I am just hoping that they get the freestyle up to par with the pump in style advanced by the time I have my next child!!(oh and if you are wondering about the handsfree option on this pump, I personally do not use it regularly, though I have tried it several times and once you get the settings right, it is fairly simple to put together.)I have no problems with the hands-free pump and love it.I hook it onto any nursing bra I have and away I go.The only thing I needed to do was buy smaller breast shields.The pump is very light and portable.I am coming up on a year of pumping while at work and this is my second pump (first was a Lansinoh that lost suction after heavy use).I have spent more time cursing this pump than loving it.When I have a second kid I will probably invest in a different pump.First of all, the suction is terrible and the only way I could get enough suction to actually get milk out was if I pump on one side while plugging the loose tube manually with my thumb instead of plugging it into the socket available for one-sided pumping.My co-worker has this pump and she swears she can't pump but I wonder if her problem is with the suction and not that she doesn't let down for the pump.I also end up with a lot of milk leaking if I'm not careful.If you lean forward, forget it, your clothes are done.I have poured ounces of milk on my lap, on my chair at work, and on the floor.My office probably smells like a dairy farm.I finally figured that out.There are some features I like about this pump, which is why it gets two stars instead of one:Size is great.Battery life is great.Hands-free is a good idea, if I didn't have suction problems.Also like that you can wear it, so it is truly hands-free.Except for the suction and leakage problems!Quiet enough for work.Small enough to take everywhere--I have hung this on a coat hook under a jacket at a conference, etc.I like the storage bottles and the ice pack.Medela, fix the suction problems!I researched pumps like crazy before settling on this one.PROS1.And is powerful- I've never used higer than 7 (it goes to 10) and have had good results.And you can throw it under a blanket or a pillow at home to muffle it- I can easily watch tv or have a conversation while I pump.2.Working full time and commuting by public transport, I really didn't want to drag 2 bags to work each day.This pump, the cooler, and all the bits I need fit inside a small lululemon bag, which fits inside my normal work bag, with room for lunch and other odds and ends.3.The included hands free system- it's clunky, but it works, and is a necessity for double pumping.Buying a bustier to hold on a cheaper pump adds $30, so this helps justify the cost.4.The convenience of a rechargable battery pack.The charge lasts a week, and I can pump anywhere, everywhere.Medela customer service- sent me a new hands free system free of charge when I lost one of the small pieces.6.The digital display is handy, for gaguing how my flow is doing, and for keeping track of how long it takes.CONS1.The only complaint I have is the cover to the battery-- it occasionally slides off.And if the battery itself comes loose, the unit demands to be recharged for about 20 hours before it's happy.You can still use it with the power cord of course, but I'd like to see the battery cover locked more firmly in place.This pump is a good one, but it has 3 major design flaws for a working mom IMHO.1) The parts all have to be aligned JUST RIGHT to get decent suction.I usually have to hook it all up, start pumping and unhook all the parts WHILE I'm pumping to reassemble them with suction to get it to fix.Sometimes, I have to do this several times.I called Medela because I was convinced I was doing something wrong, and it turns out this is a REALLY common complaint.The rep told me that I was doing everything right and that I might try new pump parts or drying everything.Needless to say, this was TOO MUCH of a hassle at the office in the little time I have to pump.I have a rental pump at the office that's stationary, and I use this pump at home where I can walk around if I need to.2)  It is NOISY.I have several friends at work who bought this pump and we've all found out the hard way that you can't answer the phone with it.I can't pump in a room with a sleeping baby.And, people who know the noise can hear me at the office through a locked door and about 10 feet of distance.Not cool.3)  This is my biggest complaint - if you don't have the bottles at the right angle, milk POURS out.If you're leaning back in a chair, milk pours out.If you have a bottle leaning slightly, or if the bottle screws on wrong but you can't tell, or... you get the idea.I use a rental symphony which uses the same parts as the Pump in Style and I've never had a problem.But, with the freestyle, I have lost milk countless times.And, we're talking OUNCES.There is nothing worse than realizing that you're sitting in a puddle, and you've just lost all the milk you work so hard to pump for your baby.I have seriously cried over spilled milk!I'm petite (5'2") with large breasts and a post-partum pooch when I sit down.The bottles rest on my legs when I pump because there's not a lot of room from my nipples to my lap.It's so easy for the bottles to slip, or tilt.I just hate this.I have to say, I bought this pump because it was supposed to be "the best" and I thought it would be so handy and convenient.And now, after Breast Feeding Store clerks and Lactation Consultants have told me not to use it (after I bought it.Thanks for nothing), I tell people it's a buyer beware.I'm mostly happy with it, and it's mostly convenient to be able to fold laundry, walk around, etc.But you have to weigh the pros and cons... if I were still using this at the office, I think I'd go crazy.I hate giving bad reviews... and i actually love Medela because their customer service is amazing but this pump is just okay.I've had a lot of the same problems as these other ladies... my first pump worked great the first month but then started to have suction problems.Medela sent me out new parts two times and then they replaced the pump.The second pump works well, I will need more time with it.If the battery power is down even a little bit it starts to have suction problems again which is SO frustrating.There is also a problem with the chafing or your breasts sticking to the breastshields.Also the "hands free" doesnt work for me.I think you will need to have very small breast for it to work.I'm at four months pumping 3 times a day.Im considering calling Medela and asking them to switch pumps all together.I cant compare it to other pumps but from hearing other reviews I would recommend a different pump.UPDATE:  I now have my second breast pump for about two months and it works fine.I dont need to charge it immediately after pumping but need to make sure the battery doesnt get low.I still would recommend a different MEDELA pump instead of this one unless A) You have a small chest size (because the hands free seems to only works for your size) B) You want the convenience of a small pump to take to work, in car, etc.C) You dont care about the cost because you have plenty of money to spend on whatever you want.Much better than the Medela they had us use at the hospital.However, if you are spending the extra money on this pump because it is hands-free, be forewarned...it is a bit awkward.The clips have to be positioned just right for the milk not to spill out and it's almost comical to see yourself all hooked up to the machine.Sometimes, I'd rather just hold the pump than go hands-free because it can take some time to get everything set up and also because it is not 100% effective at getting a good suction when set up hands-free.Great pump so far!I have been using the Freestyle for two weeks now and I am very satisfied with it.Compared to the Medela Pump in Style that I had previously, this one is so much more convenient to use.The noise level seems to be about the same or maybe slightly lower than my PIS was, but the type of sound this one makes is much less annoying for me.I love this pump!It has made my life with a 2 month old so much easier.I am able to pump and do things around the house or tend to him at the same time.I was using the medela sling single pump before and I was not able to get as much out in 15min as a I am with the free style!I was having a slight problem with low milk in the evenings but after using this pump for just a few days and I was able to store up a lot more milk for when I return to work.I would highly recommend this pump to anyone wanting to increase supply, freeze milk and pump hands free!Ugh.So, if you're considering a Freestyle, just take this into account:Don't let them make you think they are the only hands-free pump.Just buy a $20 pumping halter and virtually any pump is hands-free.Many even have optional battery power.Albeit, Freestyle has the handy belt attachment, but unless you are mountain climbing while pumping, I'm not sure what purpose that serves.I hope you have oversupply, because this pump leaks like crazy.(This inability to lean forward also makes me wonder when on earth you'd use the belt).It's loud.Really loud.In fact, I always get let down with it and often get more milk than with the Medela.The softcups are a pain.Mine needed to be replaced after 4 months because they were so wrinkled they did not work and milk pooled in them while I pumped, dripping all over me and running down my rib cage when I unhooked it.There are 8 parts to clean.That's a lot.My other pump has 2.Again, many moms absolutely love it, but I just wanted to share so that you are going into it with eyes wide open if you are considering a Freestyle.I bought two of these baskets from Amazon for my daughter when she was expecting her first child.Quite frankly, I thought she was a bit crazy to want these, but I needed things to reach the free shipping amount so these fit the bill.Having used them for the past six weeks, I can now say I would not be without these dishwashing baskets.The basket closes securely and prevents gunk from settling in the bottle parts which are not being flipped around during the dishwasher's cycles.Each basket holds parts for three bottles, so I am glad that I purchased two of these.As most people looking for this know, the washing basket is designed to be used with Dr. Brown's bottles.that need to be washed.The little washing basket makes it easier to organize the various small parts of the bottle and ensure that they do not fall out when placed in the top rack of the dishwasher.The textured bumps and nubbies makes it feel nice on her gums.My baby loved her soothie pacifiers but since she starting teething has shown little interest in doing anything but chewing on her fist!But the teether is very wide, thick and heavy, and she can barely fit even a corner of it in her mouth.Now she's a preemie, so for bigger babies this may not be a problem.I was given a soothie pacifier in the hospital and my little one was completly disinterested.When she began teething, I was looking for a variety of chewy toys and thought I would give it a try.Turns out that she really likes it.I would give it a try for your teething baby...provided a little releif for everyone in my house.My little guy had turned his old, barely-used Soothies into teething toys recently and we've caught him shoving the whole darn thing in his mouth.I like how easy they are to clean, too.She can grab it and chew everywhere she likes.This product is really large (takes up my 4 month olds whole bottom half of her face), really bulky, and really heavy (which makes it tough for her to hold onto or keep in her mouth).I wouldn't recommend it for early teething babies.We may try again in a few months.My 7 month old daughter still needs swaddling.She just simply cannot sleep without it.I just wish it was stronger and designed more like the Halo one.The only issue with it is that if you use it a few times, the cotton gets stretched out, and at that point it is easy for them to break out of it.I have the cotton, fleece, and gingham versions and have used them with 2 babies so far.This one is much better, but buy a few of them so you can have one fresh clean "shrunken" one every time baby goes to bed.I bought these for my Medela Freestyle pump and they fit.I ordered some Dr. Brown's lids since they fit, too.These are cheaper than Medela and for me, are better, since I don't need all the nipples, etc that come with Medela bottles.I'm on my third baby, so my Ameda bottles are old and aren't BPA-free.These bottles not only fit the pump, but they also fit into the bottleholders on the unit (even though they are hex shape and not round THEY STILL FIT).This becomes important when you're switching out bottles and need a stable place for the one holding milk, particularly when pumping in your bed during the night.The bottle caps for milk storage purposes are a pain, but I buy the Dr. Brown one-piece caps and they fit just fine.The bottles themselves are great but I am extremely annoyed with the caps.These are great extra milk storage bottles.They are compatible with my Medela Pump in Style, and they have great lids- a collar with a removable insert so you can either store the milk or use the collar with a nipple to feed baby.I am glad I came across the Evenflo milk storage bottle - significantly cheaper than Medela's bottle.I use it for collection, storage and feedingI bought these to store breast milk in and was very happy when i found out that they fit with my medela pump!this is cute and really well made.my baby has a hard time getting his hands around it right now (4 months old) to really hold onto it.he's drooling like a fountain and this really soaks it up so there's no "puddle" on the blanket or his shirt!Don't let the simple, no-fuss design deter you; not only do these prevent gas as well as the fancier bottles, but they have fewer parts and are a snap to clean!No more valves, tubes, etc.cluttering up the dishwasher.Hope my baby enjoys it as well!It's made very well, and matches my stroller.The bar that comes with this also serves as something my baby can hold, which is nice.This bottle worked for my 6 month baby.We tried 5 other kinds of bottles and this one is the closest to the nature breast.It is very soft and the nipple is shorter than other bottles have which worked just right for my baby.She took the bottle from the second try.The only problem we have now is that she doesn't like the taste of the formula.But at least now she can drink from a bottle.I didn't find that filling the bottle with liquids was hassle.You just need to fit the nipple right to the center of the lid.I think that this is a good disposable system, because I definitely do not smell anything in my child's room.Yes smells are released when the small trap door is opened, but you only have it opened for the time you shove the diaper through the hole.My friend had the diaper can that the bag had to be twisted and you had to put your hand far down in the can.EWWW is all I can say about that.I don't know what the problem was with that can, but it smelled.She and her husband would keep it in another room because it was so stinky, which of course defeats the idea of convenience.I didn't buy one just because of this, I mean come on, should you have to buy something for a disposable system?Anyway, back to this one.I am unsure how many diapers that we stuff into this thing, but it sure does the job that it was supposed to do in my book.I would definitely buy this again if I had to and would definitely recommend to anyone in general.I ordered this bag hoping it would fit my 9oz BornFree baby bottles.It definitely can fit two of these bottles with enough room for a freezer pack.The insulation isn't what I expected: it is very thin and not at all like regular lunch packs.Nonetheless, it is very cute, fits the bottles, and with the ice-pack will keep things cold for our commute to daycare.I'll keep it because it's cute and functional enough.Great bottle cooler.Seems durable so far.It's a sewing method flaw in their pattern/design.Their velcro style makes the diaper bulkier and "stiffer" at the waist.Don't make the assumption, like I did, that the HH velcro will be harder for your child to pull off.If they understand velcro comes off, they pull it off, no matter how strong  ;-)I can't believe how easy they are to care for and put on, how adjustable they are and how little they leak.I can say I only had one leak so far and that was user error.My little one is now 4 months, growing like a weed and I have been using them since the umbilical fell off.I can't wait to watch the silly little cow printed hiney crawling across the floor!I got this because my carpet is worn ans has no padding in my rental home and my daughter doesn't seem to understand that hitting her head hurts.It's easy to break down when you don't have the room to keep it assembled all of the time.The only thing that I didn't like about it was that it's not as easy to clean as they claim.She spit up carrots and peas on it a few times and it's stained.Apparently my foot was dirty.There's a permanent foot mark on it.So it's not so pretty after having it for a few months.The only other that I didn't care for much is that as she learned to crawl the surface was so darn slippery that she couldn't get a grip.It's the main reason I had to replace it with carpet.Another nice use - When I do exercise tapes I use it as my mat!We got it to add a little cushion to the uncomfortable "mattress" that comes with the Pack and Play, which it did help alot with (along with the super soft sheet we got -American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Porta-Crib Sheet - Celery).The pad is thin and easy to wash.  Its also small enough folded up that sometimes I stuff it in the diaper bag and use it as a travel changing pad.I recommend!I was excited to get this after reading all the positive reviews, but after I washed it according to instructions, it was positively COVERED in fuzz.Velcro-like, stringy clumps of linty fuzz.I hoped that tumbling it on low would remove them, but no.So I tried washing it again -- no luck.Those stringy lint balls are stuck all over like velcro, but they like to come off in bits on anything else that touches it now and then -- like the sheets I washed it with, or my clothes as I folded it.Other than that, this is a thin, flat pad that feels like a piece of plastic encased in thin linty material that has some sort of embossed print that makes it slightly quilted.It fits on the Pack 'n Play mattress board, leaving some space around the edges, and is thin enough that it's easy to stretch a sheet over top.Blue is so overrated.It is a nice thickness, not too light or heavy.This is nothing impressive to look at -- just a small thin lightweight waffle-weave eggshell-colored blanket, not as soft as I imagined and it also didn't come with the plush teddy bear patch embroidery as stated in the description...My baby has had this since she was 6 months old.Just like a previous reviewer, we thought it might be the batteries, but it appears to be something amiss in the motor.It has worked since that first failure, but only for a few minutes and then 'quits' again.Our son still loves to play with the parts, but it's not something he can 'chase' which was the main purpose in buying it.My 6 month old loves this toy!The little squeaker toy is really fun to play with, too.Overall, it has provided many hours of fun and seems to be several toys in one.But I'm pretty upset because I thought this snail would come with 2 shells as shown in multiple pictures.Mine only came with the stackable shell.I was already hesitant to pay $30, but to find that it comes with only 1 shell, I feel totally ripped off.When I called the company to ask where the other shell is, they said that they can't do anything because all their merchandise is handled by Amazon so I should contact them.I contacted Amazon and they said the description doesn't mention 2 shells (only 1) so there's nothing they can do about that.I said there are 2 pictures showing the other shell, and they told me in a very condescending tone, "We undertand that ma'am but it is not our fault you didn't read the description."My 9 month old got this toy for Christmas and he loves the snail part.Doesn't care so much for the stacker shell although he likes to hold the stacking bits and chew on them.The nice thing for us is the music is very tolerable and not too loud.The problem is, he can't crawl or walk yet so he gets incredibly frustrated after a while because he can't get to the snail on his own steam.Sigh, snail goes in the closet for another few months.2 months later--I pulled the snail out of the closet this week and he can't get enough of it.He still loves to grab the wheels while they're turning but now he's figuring out that the 2 front wheels turn and the 2 back ones don't and he's turning the back wheels.The snail doesn't go anywhere on the thick carpet in his room so that's where he plays with it and as soon as he sees it, he reaches for it and gets mad if we don't let him play with it.My 8month old very quickly learned how to start it and loved it.However, the batteries soon wore out and now only last a day or two.There is something wrong with the motor design for this to happen.It does need an ON/OFF button.They couldn't have been easier to use and we were able to release them quickly with one hand most times.I definitely recommend this inexpensive, non-permanent option if you have small children over at times.The plastic seems cheap, but it gets the job done.My toddler hasn't been able to get in the cabinets since!If you're looking for burp cloths that are pretty and useful, these definitely do the trick.I don't mind as I use them on my shoulder for a 5-month old that can hold her head up (I might not have liked them when she was a few weeks old).It looks deformed.Just put the peices in the tray and pop it in the dishwasher.The only negative is that it only holds 3 complete sets at a time.I guess that is understandable though because there are sooo many parts to each bottle.That is why I gave it 5 stars.I think that these washcloths are just okay.They are soft, but not super soft.I find them a little too thick for cleaning in my little one's ears.I love, love, love these washcloths...so much that I think I might buy them again.They are very thick and well made.I purchased the car seat adaptor with the intentions of the Baby Jogger City Mini (BJCM) being my one and only stroller.While I do think that using this adaptor makes it definitely worthwhile to be able to use this stroller (BJCM) for anything and everything, it made it to where it wasn't a quick "snap the carseat on and go" type of adaptor.I used this with a Graco Snugride car seat.What you do when you get the "kit" is slide the bar into the two black adaptors (that connect to the seat) with the bar pointing up or down depending on the type of car seat you are going to be using.Then you will connect the black pieces to the stroller and using your car seat, adjust how far out the bar needs to be for it to attach your car seat to it.Pretty simple overall, but I found that I did need to adjust our bar a handfull of times in the 7 months that we used it.You do have to fasten a strap around (over) the car seat for safety reasons because otherwise the car seat could essentially tip over and fall off the stroller.This is where the convienance of being able to "snap the car seat on and go" lacked.In order to get the car seat on properly, you often had to get down to eye level and see if the car seat was sitting on the black "nesting" areas, and then check the bar length followed by securing the car seat with the strap.If your child isn't already in the car seat when you secure it, it can be a pain to then properly put your child in.So while this is definitely great to have, just know that you won't have the "snap and go" convienance of other strollers while using a car seat with it.I love this product so far.I've had it for a few weeks and it's perfect for hanging toys and having my little one pull herself forward.It does get in the way of the amazing fold on the stroller (you have to grab under the bar to get the stroller to fold without awkwardly hindering your hold).And in order to make it easy to fit in the trunk, I have to adjust the bar straight.But all in all, it's handy.The only thing I don't like about this belly bar is the price.I wish it came standard with the City Series strollers.If he's tired, he will lean back and prop his feet on it.It is also great for linking toys, or using the SippigripBooginhead SippiGrip, Blackto attach his sippy cup or Munchie mugMunchie Mug - The New Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers.Made in the USA.- BPA Free.FDA compliant materials.- Blue Top.I also love that the bar is adjustable, so it grows with your child.Most belly bars don't have this feature.I would suggest the belly bar over the snack tray-- it's more versatile.The snack tray also sits too high up for smaller children.I find the bar a little bit of a bother to put in and take out (might just be the learning curve since I've only used it a few times), and it seems kind of pointless.Maybe they will find it more useful when they're a little taller.(They are 32" and 33", respectively, now at 18 months.)I wish Baby Jogger would redesign the stroller to sit fully upright at the least reclined setting; then I think the belly bar (and snack trays, if you buy them) would be easier to use.The snack tray sits up too high for most children and is not adustable.This bar has several settings that you can adjust the "height" of it (just changes the angle of it - out straight in the picture, lower and higher.)I use ours on setting lower than the picture, and my son loves it.He holds on to the bar and just looks around when out strolling or sitting in the stroller watching a parade, etc.These bottles are way better than the Avent bottles and cheaper.I haven't used it yet as we are still waiting for baby's arrival.But it looks easy to use and arrived quickly.I love this little mat.It's cute and it does it's job.There are a gazillion suction cups on the bottom, but I still found it relatively easy to get all of them stuck down.Mine never comes up from the bottom of the tub.Over all I am happy with this product.Mat won't stick to bottom of tub until you use it wet.Problem is that I pull this off to dry after the bath (otherwise it gets really dirty underneath).I usually love Safety 1st products, I have the matching faucet cover in that bathroom, and my son's bathroom is froggie-themed.It doesn't stick to the bottom of the tub at all.Weirdly enough, it does stick to the walls of the tub, but not the bottom.I could live with that, since my son would be sitting on it to keep it down, except that it came shipped all rolled up, and after two weeks of pressing it flat, it still will not stay unrolled.The moment I put it in the tub (dry!)it begins to roll back up, and add water and there is no chance it will stay down.I am very disappointed - I had to go out and buy another mat.I have ended up using it as wall-art, stuck to the side of the tub, and is very cute.But it serves no purpose besides appearance there.I used to have the Mommy Hook Stroller Hanger, and I loved it until it broke (pretty quickly).I like the Hook 'n Stroll hooks better.I like the velcro closure, the fact that they swivel, and you get two of them!The only downside is the space where you hook something is a little small, which requires a little more attention when you're hanging something on there.But overall, a great hook and very useful.I had so much troubles with the bugaboo frog to put any bag on the handle-everything will slide down, I ended up putting bags on the break handle but it worried me it would break it eventually.I was looking for this kind of product and read a lot of reviews.These are great swivel stroller hooks.I have used them to hold diaper bags, beach bag, small cooler, grocery bags, etc.I prefer these over the mommy hook.This is a nice product I must admit - soft and cuddly and a good wrapper.However, my daughter is in the 99th percentile for height and starting at 1 month she could be wrapped in this for a month before she outgrew it.They should give height limits instead of weight limits - it would have saved me from buying this product and wasting my money on it for the short use I got from it.This and the Kiddopotamus & Co. Organic Cotton SwaddleMe - Ivory were two of the best baby products I've had the pleasure to own.My 3 1/2 month old girl was a much better sleeper at night with these on.With a sleepsack or something else for night, she would wake up as soon as we tried to put her down.The swaddleme kept her arms from flailing and seemed to give her a secure and comforting feeling.The Swaddleme worked much better to help her sleep, and I also thought it was far superior to theMiracle Blanket - Baby Swaddling Blanket - Beige.I was excited to try the swaddleme out after all the positive reviews.I loved the fact that it was organic.Unfortunately, I hate to say I was disappointed.Here's why:SMALL.We washed the swaddler before our son arrived home.Sadly, this swaddler shrunk after washing.It was washed exactly as the packaging recommends.KICKS FREE.If he had his choice, he would have his hands out while he is sleeping.As most newborns, he kicks a lot at night and he wakes himself in the middle of the night because he gets so frustrated being in this swaddler.There is one slightly redeeming value about this swaddle, though.Some were better for newborns than older infants:Newborn:aden + anais blue oh boy!when he got too tall for it, we just took his legs out of the bottom.Halo Innovations Sleepsack Swaddle 100% Cotton, Cream, Small-- these were perfect for cold nights.muslin swaddlesaden + anais Slumber Muslin Sleeping Bag Single Layer, Jungle Jam - Elephant, Small-- we now use these to keep my son warm on cool nights, they are a great alternative to swaddling)Halo Innovations Sleepsack Swaddle 100% Cotton, Cream, Small- This is great for a baby that prefers to be swaddled with their arms out.I love this play mat!My daughter loves this and spends lots of time on her tummy now, before this she would scream/cry whenever i would giver her tummy time, but not ever since this play mat has been an addition to her toy collection, she does 3 intervals of tummy time for 15 mins a day w/o any fussiness.If you have a baby that hasn't adjusted well to tummy time, this is the purchase to make!I mean this thing does its job but it is not a wow for me.That pillow is way too loose, in my opinion.But, I mean, for right in the beginning when you want to practice the tummy time is fine.Like most babies who sleep on their backs, our son hates tummy time.He tolerates it a little longer with the mat/pillow than without it.The pillow can be used to lay the baby on his chest for tummy time or back for other play.He also loves the little mouthing toy that came with the mat.The mirror is nice to have but the baby has to be able to push up pretty well on his arms in order to be able to see himself in it.It's cute...This item has been a great way to support our little guy's upper body while he practices being on his tummy.I do like this quality because I have put that piece on the bed, on the ottoman, or wherever it suits us for him to practice on his tummy.Overall, I recommend it.It comes with a variety of sounds and a really nice mirror.I suspect that the readers who gave this plate a negative review for not sticking to the surface didn't apply water to the suction side.A little water makes these stick tight to the surface they are set on.In our case, our 14 month old has tried to tear them off her highchair tray but they have stayed put.It is a simple fix for these very cute and easy to use plates (they are even cuter in person than in this picture)They are not soft fabric and are plastic.I love that is simple and soft and matches our Eddie Bauer car seat.It is great to stuff in the diaper bag and go or just throw over the side of the travel crib to use for naps.It is very versatile and handy for new moms.This blanket is one of my favorite for swaddling my newborn, now 3 weeks old and over 10 lbs.The teddy bear decal is soft and makes this blanket, what I hope to be, a keepsake for my son as he grows.All other cotton blankets are more softer than this one.Also it shrank around 10 cm on first washing.I would not recommend buying this.I'm an ER nurse and we use Exergen's temporal artery thermometers in our ER.DO NOT LIFT the thermometer at all!!!2.repeat this 2 more times3.take the HIGHEST of the 3 readings.clean the head of the thermometer with a Q-tip and some alcohol occasionally to help it read accurately.5.In this case, it is better to run the thermometer over their carotid artery on their neck- off to the side of the voicebox.Aside from the fact that all of the other options just do not make sense--I don't want to use a rectal therm for my toddler, he will not tolerate a therm in the mouth or under the arm, and the ear therms don't seem accurate.This is insanely easy to use.The only option is to turn it off and then on again, which I worry is depleting the battery, but it's not a huge deal.I also like the idea of the antimicrobial head so that I don't have to clean it with alcohol.Overall, the best option I have found for a squirmy toddler, as well as the whole family.First time mom.I also didn't want to buy one that required replacement pieces.Just something simple that worked.One never got above 95.0 degrees.Good buy.I really like this product but I think it is over-priced considering the simplicity of it and the materials used.However, I would buy it again if I couldn't find a similar one at a lesser price.I stand him in front of the mirror and he lets me get rid of his stuff nose without a fuss.Plus, it is easy to clean.The clear suction tube comes off, as does the the plastic part with 2 arms inside that sucks the snot out (it connects to the top bulb part) and then of course the clear container that catches all of that ickyness.So I haven't a clue why people say you can't clean it... it is super easy.We also like that we can see exactly what come out of his nose.I run it under water every time so the snot doesn't dry to it.I also like that it doesn't go "up" his nose.He still cries with this but it's the best.It's easy to clean and i just unscrew the bottom and put in hot water for a few minutes and it's clean.The only problem is if you invert it while sucking air, you might end up with a little nasal discharge in the tube but they tell you to use it while the child is upright so it's your fault if you don;t follow the instructions.It's easier for your baby to use the solution first though.Purchased this over the Bebepod because it came with the tray and toy included.We couldn't be happier.The first time seeing your baby sit in this is just so precious.They may lean a little but this chair will train them to sit on their own faster.This product is HIGHLY recommended.This is sooo much better than the Bumbo, and here's why: first, it comes with a tray--you have to buy the tray separately for the Bumbo.It also has a toy that attaches to the tray and my daughter loves it.It keeps her entertained for a while.No such thing with the Bumbo.You can also switch out the tray for a little knob that the baby can hold onto.Again, no such thing with the Bumbo.I highly recommend this product.I've had this seat for over five weeks now and it still smells like chemicals.I've tried washing it with vinegar one time and soapy water another but nothing has gotten rid of the smell.It was completely useless and over-priced!He's skinny and his thighs were so squished (without the tray on), he screamed and pushed his way out of it.Forget about even attaching the tray...I felt like I was putting his legs in a guillotine.My son did like the toy that came with it though!The seller was very pleasant.We started putting him in it I think at around 2 months and it was great.He is a very strong baby so he would sit there for 3 or 4 minutes before getting upset.Now he is 4 1/2 months and he doesn't seem to like it as much.We use it mostly for feeding and he will slump over and not hold himself up (this could be just him being fussy) and cry when we put him in it.I do love the bright colors and the fact it came with the tray and toy and covers.Otherwise, I really like it and hopefully my baby will start enjoying it a little more as well.This worked OK for a few weeks.As some other reviewers noted the vinyl rips when you try to take the bumper out soyou have to be extra careful with that.I loved this product for our daughter until she was about 10 weeks old.She outgrew it quite quickly.Granted, she's a larger, taller baby than most, but I can't imagine anyone using it for more than six months without their baby feeling crammed in.It's really easy to clean but if your baby has an accident while they're in it, it pools underneath them just like any other diaper changer.I wouldn't buy again.For the price, they should make it longer and larger.I have the navy changer and have been using it with my newborn for nearly 3 weeks now.The only problem I have found is that when my baby boy pees while we are changing him the urine pools underneath him since there is nothing to absorb it.We clean it with a mild cleanser periodically but honestly a wipe does just fine.I haven't noticed any issues with discoloration or wear.Excellent product.It truly is not cold to the touch even in the middle of the night and cleans very easily.UPDATE 8/22/11:My baby was only 5.5lbs when we brought him home, so he looked really tiny in this changer.He is now 13 mos and over 2ft long (or tall, I guess), and his feet stick out over the edge.While we still use this, I'm afraid its useful life is coming to a close for us.One concern I do have is when he is lying down on it to be changed, he puts his feet against the lip and pushes, but since he is longer than the changer, his head hits the top, and then he screams because his head is being smushed, not knowing that if he would just stop pushing with his feet, his head would be fine.Never had to take a cover off due to mess getting on it.We just wiped it down with bleach, dried it really well, and it was ready to go.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Saw this in a magazine and Amazon was the only place that carried it.Ordered it in Chai Tan and absolutely LOVE IT!Cushion and soft for my baby, doesn't get cold, the built-in head rest is a very nice feature, and the sides are tall enough that baby won't roll away.Best part is that it is completely waterproof.It doesn't stain the changer at all, and there are no changer covers to buy, remove and wash.  We end up having to change baby's clothes because they get dirty as a result, but that's ok with us.As for the Chai Tan color, some people say it looks like baby poop.Since my baby has pooped on it several times, I can attest that though the color is similar, it is not the same.My baby is breastfed exclusively right now, and his stools are a nuclear bright yellow.We absolutely love it and are highly recommending it to our pregnant friends.Once food is in there, he has to turn the spoon upside down in his mouth to get it out.This spoon isn't usually the one we choose.My daughter is almost 2 1/2 years old and has been potty trained for only about 6 weeks at this point.It's been especially great while she's figuring out how to go #2 and she asks to go potty 15 times before actually completing the task.I'll cut to the chase.PROS:Here's the brilliance of this potty seat:1) the "wings" (which serve as the base for the seat when in stand-alone potty form) that flip out to put on the adult toilet seat are secure and heavyweight;2) these same wings have rubberized grippy bits on the ends, which keeps them from slipping around on the adult potty seat;3) the base of the flipped-out bits can serve as a grip for the child inclined to grab the (*ack*) public seat.We've used this primarily as a portable potty seat, because we have another portable potty chair in the back of our van.But I can see this working well for that function, too.CON:1) the hole is small, which makes wiping a newbie a little challenging.(It doesn't bother me, because my child stands to get wiped at this stage.)I suspect some ankle-grabbing would suffice.It doesn't pose a problem for the function, just, potentially, the cleanup.Overall: win!I keep it in the car for emergencies and when she was toilet training I put it in the stroller for walks too.I like that the legs can fold flat for storage, and that they click into place to sit.(It might seem obvious if you know it already, but wasn't obvious to grandma who borrowed it while babysitting.)The bags are great and perfectly sized to smoothly cover the seat for no mess--expensive, but we don't use them that often.I've also just set the seat out over grass/dirt and used it sans bag (what can I say, I'm cheap like that).I've tried a grocery bag, but they are so crinkly and slippery, and the ink flakes off...so I prefer the bag made by Potette.I like that it has bags b/c clean up is SO EASY!!!I don't have to rinse out a little potty or find somewhere to rinse it or toss the TP/wipe.That is by far the biggest plus!Especially since my 2 yr old likes "privacy" so she likes it in the back of the SUV rather than on the ground in the parking lot.It does sit very low to the ground, so it might be less comfortable for bigger toddlers, but that's a sacrifice for convenience and portability.Yes, its not the biggest place for a bottom to rest BUT proof is in the usage:My 3 year old didn't miss a beat (or the seat) the first time she used it.We keep it in the back of the car ready to go and she just hops on there when needed.Its little legs were a little difficult to lock into place (and in-lock) the first couple of times but after that it was a cinch.Once in place it is very stable.They bags hold everythign well and its easy to get set up and packed away for next time.Ideal for travel or a trip to the park when the porta potties are a little more aromatic than desired.Nor was my daughter.When I took her potty out to clean the bathroom floor, she told me that her potty belongs in the potty next to Mommy and Daddy's potty.We nixed the idea of moving the potty.Then one evening while she was getting ready for bed and giving the 10th excuse to get out of bed, she stated, "I need to go potty."I didn't want to stop her if she really needed to and felt telling her to go in her overnight would probably be confusing to her.I also didn't want her to leave the bedroom.I quickly remembered the portable potty!They seem flimsy but do the job well.Each bag has this square liner that helps absorb liquid.You wipe, drop the wipes in the bag and just take the handles off the sides and tie it up and trash.The bags have a light but pleasant scent that isn't too overpowering.The portable potty plus also gives you the option to make it a seat on top of a standard toilet.Parts are made of rubber that seem to help with stability and no slip.A few tips that I culled from reading the manual and speaking to other parents:1.If you open it up to be a portable potty, make sure to snap the legs closed so it doesn't collapse on your child.If you use it as a seat over the toilet, make sure the handle bars are also locked so your child's fingers don't get caught in between the seat and the toilet seat.3.If you use it as a portable potty, you can leave a maximum of three bags on it.and plop back onto the seat after you pulled the dirty bag off move.This potty is not for the very young or for those that cannot sit upright for long periods of time.It is a portable potty so it only has the seat and does not provide any back support.I only state this as some folks have early potty learners.We started using the Bjorn at age 15 months as a chair.We use this potty often, and although the seat is small it seems to serve its purpose.My only complaint is buying the bags.They can be costly when you use it as often as we do.And any new child learning to potty train will need to go before entering the store, and when coming out of the store!I also only have 1 store nearby that carries these bags, and once there shelves are empty I am out of luck until they get more in.I have used a shopping bag in a pinch, but be forwarned they are not usually leak proof.I have also used small garbage bags with a maxi pad which served its purpose but can also be a disaster as the bag would stick to my sons bottom as he would stand, and also while out in public it looked ridiculas.Wish they made some type of adapter or someway to use diaper diaposal bags as this would be more cost effective and easier.But overall we like this seat, and is small enough to throw in the diaper bag, or under the stroller.This potty can stand alone and be used with the bags that come with it, or, you can use shopping/trash bags (I just use a roll of 4 gallon bags purchased at Target or a "dollar" store).You can also use this potty on top of a real potty by opening the legs.One of my girls is not a fan of public restrooms and will not use a big potty, but, I can offer her her own (potette) potty, and she'll use that one.Her sister is willing to use the public potty, and I can use this same potty by putting it on the big potty.This potty is small enough that it will fit in your purse, backpack, or diaper bag.The "carry bag" that comes with it is just a small plastic bag - nothing fancy.The seat can fit either direction.The only "negatives" I have found is that it fits funny on elongated seats (works but sometimes you have to set the seat all the way to the front or back) and sometimes you have to fiddle with the legs to get them to pop in to the right place (when locking or unlocking).We take this with us on trips in addition to the potette but leave it in the truck and carry the Potette in our bag.I use the same 4 gallon bags.The only negative is that it doesn't work on big potties (it wasn't designed to - but just thought I'd mention it in comparison).The Ginsey folding seats are just too flimsey and they slide all over the place.Sure, it folds up nice and small, but for a few bucks more, I think the Potette is a better investment.I also own:Baby Bjorn Potty Chair,BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Toilet Trainer - White/Black, BRU potty/seat, two seats like these:Ginsey Dora Soft Potty SeatHint - just use nursing pads in the bottom of the bag to soak up the urine.I bought the Potette Plus (green seat with blue legs) at my local Babies R Us about 6 months ago.Another reviewer made the comparison to it being like the rim of a toilet without the seat - fairly accurate description.I just measured the hole and it's 6 inches wide by 7 inches long.Compare that to the Fisher Price On the Go Potty (love that too) which has a hole measuring 4 1/2 inches wide by 6 inches long and it makes a huge difference.I still believe the hole is much too big, especially since the potty is so low to the ground (only 4 inches tall in it's snapped together standing position!), making it a little hard for younger toddlers to position themselves correctly on it.I am not sure how the kids in the product pictures are sitting on it with their legs out in front of them - my daughter has to straddle it.So those are the only two negatives I have found with this seat.On to the good stuff.It's small and when folded, can easily fit into a large purse or backpack, and it's lightweight enough to hang it (in a bag of some sort) over a stroller handle.I used to keep the Fisher Price On the Go potty in my van, but now I only have this one in the van since it's so much smaller, lighter, and I can grab it and put it into a large purse for excursions.My daughter doesn't like to sit on the plastic bag that's supposed to go over the seat, so we had to figure out a way to make that work until she gets used to sitting on the plastic bag.We cut down a 1 gallon ice cream pail so it would fit under the potty and we use the bags in the bucket, then put the potette over that.4 gallon trash bags work very well too.I've never used it as a toilet reducer, but I did just place it on both of my different toilet seats at home (one is molded wood, the other is plastic and picky when it comes to toilet reducers).This seat clicks into flat position and is very sturdy.There are little grippies on the inside of the legs to help it grab the toilet seat a little and it does help slightly.Sturdy when on both toilet seats - even when pushed on by me.On the molded wood seat, the potette fit very nicely, almost center on the toilet seat.On the plastic seat, I had to push the potette back a little further for it to fit the best.It would still wiggle a bit with a wiggly toddler.I didn't buy it for this purpose though so I don't anticipate using it in this position, though it is nice to have the option.I would recommend getting two (in brown) so that you always have one ready while the other is being washed.Definitely worth the money.So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover.It's very soft and seems to be well made.We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers.While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly.It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly.If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad.But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition.It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable.This changing pad cover is super soft and cleans up well.Would buy again.I washed it many times on hot/cold and the color seems to hold.Will buy more of these for sure!They are so easy to keep in the diaper bag (unlike some non-disposable place mats that inevitably get taken out because they take up so much room) and unfold into a nice big rectangle.They are very waterproof - we are always pleased to find that when we peel up the place mat and it doesn't show any signs of falling apart or leaking through.However, even though they may get covered in water and other liquids, we were surprised to find that we were still able to color on them.Even though my son is not yet 16 months, we can keep him entertained for at least a couple of minutes with coloring on the mats and talking about the different animals and plants depicted on them.The crayons that come with the mats are triangular shaped so that they do not roll off the table - another bonus.Ours included a red, blue, green and yellow crayon.I will update the review if we get around to it.As an extra bonus, I don't feel the guilt that I would if I purchased the plastic place mats because they are biodegradable.If there was any kids of negative, it would be that sometimes the adhesive backing strips on the bottom may be the teeniest tiniest hard to peel off.Just a warning if you have terrible hand dexterity or hand-eye coordination... Once peeled off and placed down, the mat has always stayed down - even covering the table edge (which my man sometimes still likes to bite down on at times.)Fabulous product!We only have a shower in there and I needed a way to bathe my child when she was a baby.We used it from the time she was 4 months old to the time she was 20 months old.She got too big for it them and was used to being in the shower with me by then.This tub stored very easily for travel, was easy to clean, easy to fill with water and was easy to drain.She had room to play when she was smaller.Toward the end, she didn't have room for her boats in there with her, but it served the purpose we bought it for.We will certainly be saving it to use with our next child.I chose this tub because the reviews said it was non-slip.I don't ever deflate it.Ijust flip it over when done bathing to dry off.We have bought 5-6 different kinds of flatware for our toddler and the Take and Toss is our favorite.I tend to buy the more expensive product thinking it will be superior.For once, that is not the case.The Take and Toss has no sharp metal so toddlers don't poke themselves while learning to maneuver their forks.It is on my list of must-have's and I add it to all by baby/shower gifts.This lives in our diaper bag.Not only is it handy to have when eating away from home, but it doubles as a toy until the food arrives.My little guy loves shaking it and taking the utensils out and putting them back in, over and over.It's small, cleans up easily, and is cheap to replace when a spoon accidentally gets buried under a pile of wet wipes.I love the case that it has.It beats having them in a plastic bag all the time!I've even pulled it out to entertain my child with.Overall a great product!This has been my baby's very favorite teether.It's soft and easy for her to hold.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ears are a bit long for a teether.Worked awesome with the Winnie the pooh cradle cap soap!Just 3 days and my 4 mo old cradle cap is 100 gone!I was not worry too much about the dispenser wich it did not work very well with me, but I think is because of the consistency of the special shampoo I used for craddle cap wich is kind of heavy liquid, so it was taking too long for the dispenser to work and with a wet baby in the tub that moves a LOT you want to be quick I just used the shampoo as it is and the brush and I really liked it, I honestly recomend this one cause I also used the little sponge to bath my baby : )My newborn needed to be swaddled to stay asleep for any length of time.This product has velcro to help keep it snug.I like that the bottom pouch can be undone for diaper changes.I don't think that the Sleep Sack brand swaddlers work any better, so the price difference is a huge factor in my recommending this product.When my child got old enough to start rolling over, we stop swaddling the arms and just swaddle around the chest.It becomes a routine to wrap them up and put them to bed.My daughter actually smiles when I get the swaddle out, because she knows when it is time to go to sleep.So many cute prints!Also can keep baby swaddled without undoing the entire thing.I would use them early on though because our 4-mo-old's feet were nearly too big for the ornament!I went into a local stroller store with my heart set on buying the Maclaren volo and ended up walking out with this stroller instead.The reasons I was going to get the Volo were1.I picked up both strollers and this really did feel lighter--not by much but every bit helps.Ultimately with all the accessories I2.This has a cushy seat liner that is meshy and looks cool but is also a little padded.WIth this I don't need to worry about his butt getting too cold in winter and don't need to buy an extra piece (which only adds to the price) and I can have it be even cooler on very hot days.The sun hood is not as big as with the Volo BUT it is pivotable so you can tilt it forward, the Maclaren can't do that.Because of the way the back apron on the hood is set up it is easier to peek in on your baby in the stroller--I really hated that it was so hard to see him when he was in the Maclaren.The sun hood doesn't seem like it is water resistant like the Maclaren but since I have to keep the raincover on us all the time for walking around the city it isn't a big deal.4.I think it is easier to steer and turns more easily.5.It folds so so so so much easier.I always get really frustrated with Maclarens and folding, I just can't seem to do it easily.7.I'm not a fan of vinyl stroller covers since you are basically enclosing your child in the very stuff we are trying to keep out of their toys, but they are a necessity.There are also holes in the rain hood which I think are odd and I'm guessing are going to be annoying in a rain storm, but my son isn't made of sugar and I'd rather him get some fresh air and get a little damp from time to time.10.The rain hood is lighter weight than the Volo's and since I carry it on the stroller all the time this makes the stroller even lighter still.11.Price.At my local store this stroller was 99 dollars and the rain hood 20 so all together it was $120.The Maclaren is then $10 more (it came with a rain hood, but not all do).But since I also was planning on buying a seat liner for winter it is actually a more significant amount.12.After looking at the Uppa Baby the MAclaren fabric seems kind of cheap or flimsier.On an old Volo that we inherited and were replacing (because it was falling apart) the seat fabric was falling off the hooks that attach it to the frame.I would hook it back on and find it falling off again an hour or so later.Posture.In the G Lite the baby sits more forward in the stroller than in the Maclaren.But in the Maclaren he seemed more slouchy and hunched over.His posture was better in this stroller and it seems to have better support.14.The brakes.I hate engaging the Maclaren brakes, these are much easier.That is a much more safer option since I use them more frequently when it isn't a pain.And then as I pushed it home I discovered15.The diaper bag I had on the handle bars stayed easily with my son in the stroller and there was no threatening to tip.As I was pushing it I could feel it was back heavy and might tip if I let go.I don't really recommend putting a diaper bag that heavy on the handlebars but it is nice to know this can accommodate a little more weight.Weighing the stroller with the sun cover, rain cover, cup holder, seat liner, and maclaren organizer it weighs 10 pounds.The Volo with all these things would weigh at least 11.Everyone is different and will feel differently about these two very similar strollers, so I really recommend checking them out in person--you might change your mind too!However, we've realized that we now need to buy another stroller for travel, because the G-Lite doesn't have recline.The 7 lb weight is simply amazing, but the stroller doesn't look cheap.The sunshade is great, really covering the baby.And the fold, while two handed, is easy to do while holding the baby on my hip.You will not have a tray (not a problem for us), or any cushy strap-covers or pillows.Also, for us, the big problem is that it doesn't recline.Also, like all umbrella strollers, you shouldn't take your child out while the diaper bag is slung on the handles, as it will fall over.You see, we just took the G-Lite to NYC for the day.Slung over my shoulder, it was easy to carry up the narrow stairs at some of the stations.We could fold it up at restaurants.The underside basket is a little small but we were able to store a small bag down there.However, the problem came in that my child could not nap in this stroller.We had him all around Germany in a Teutonia, which reclines all the way like a bed, and he just took naps in it.So we thought we'd have no problem on vacation in New York.But with this stroller, he either lolled forward, or his head lay on the folding mechanism.He slept very poorly and was in a terrible mood as a result.Meanwhile, we will definitely keep the G-Lite in our trunks for quick mall jaunts.My only complaint:  the cup holder broke off of mine.It's very easy to set up, within a couple minutes you're ready to roll.The wheels turn on a dime.The handles are long enough for both my husband (6' and me 5'5") and I to push without kicking the wheels.My daughter is 3 and loves riding in it.It has all the benefits but is so much smaller and lightweight.Nevermind a one hand fold, this has a one finger fold.You pull the tab and it collapses, the safety keeps you from pulling the tab while anyone is in it.I bought this for my newborn daughter, though she's far too small (and unaware) for it yet.Seems well-made and doesn't seem like it will fall apart quickly.As someone else noted, it has an un-removable "necklace" that says NoJo all the way around.Frustrating, but the animal itself is very good.Good animal, minus stupid necklace = 4 starsI bought this despite the bad reviews and I wanted to wait until I had really used it before I wrote a review to see how well it would hold up.Now that winter is coming to an end, I have to say that I wouldn't have wanted to go through the winter without the 212 blanket.I did have a minor issue with the quality (there is a pacifier strap on the inside and the snap broke the first time I tried to use it) but other than that the Blanket is still like new.I have a lighter weight stroller blanket (JJ Cole Urban Toddler Bundle Me - Stealth) for the spring and fall but I needed something more substantial that would stand up to a New England winter.The convenience factor of this product is huge.When I pick my son up from daycare I don't have to worry about getting him to sit still long enough to wrangle him into a snow suit.I put him in the stroller and zip up the blanket 212.If it's really windy or cold then I'll also add a hat.If I did a coat too it would be too warm most of the time, although I have added a coat once or twice when the weather was extreme.The straps are very adjustable so I imagine it would fit most strollers well.There are extra velcro attachments on the underside to help it stay put on the stroller.I use it with my BOB Revolution and the only "fit" problem is that the sunshield on the stroller sometimes gets in the way of the hood of the blanket when I'm putting my son in or taking him out.I could probably get around that if I unzipped and re-zipped the hood while putting my son in the stroller, but it's not irritating enough to warrant the extra effort.In the next several weeks I'll probably be putting the blanket 212 into storage.I can't imagine having gone through this winter without our blanket 212 and I look forward to using it again next winter.The sound quality is crystal clear and I haven't had any interference problems with my iPhone.I don't have a very large house, so I haven't had any problems with the range.I even took it out on the deck in my backyard and it still worked.I have been using this monitor for abour 2 months now and I am very happy with it.I love these monitors, and what a great price!The work all over the house.Because we live in the country, I am curious to see how far they will go on our yard.But I am very impressed so far.We had a very bad experience with a fisher price monitor set.This monitor has many of the features that I was looking for.Rechargeable, dual hand sets and many channels.I'm saving so much money on batteries.It doesn't matter if you have this many channels if it's still fuzzy.It gets fuzzy just from me walking around the room.I'll roll over in bed at night and it gets fuzzy and the range alarm will go off.The A/C comes on it gets fuzzy.It has the same reception as the $20 monitor I used to have.When I upgraded to a $65 version I was expecting better than this.My monitor is exactly like that.In the end I wish I had paid the extra $30 to get the kind that seamlessly changes channels so you never have any interference.All the bells and whistles aren't worth it if I can't hear my baby.That is the whole point after all.I absolutely LOVE this monitor set!We use 'white noise' (a fan and vaccum cleaner noise CD) in the room they sleep in and it doesn't interfere with the signal or sound quality.There is a range alarm on the monitor that tells you when you're getting out of range, but I've never had it alarm (signals with a beeping noise and red light).I've took the monitor to my neighbors house which is 40-50 ft away and it never alarmed.I like that it is rechargable and doesn't use batteries!Saves tons of money in the long run since we are constantly putting batteries in toys.It has 3 setting on the side: Off, On, and voice activated.We only use the voice activated.It also comes with 3 channels if for some reason you do experience interference.Also there is a volume control that lets you turn it up if so needed.I would HIGHLY recommend this product!We live in a very noisy household with t.v's, cell phones, microwave, etc.. and we have NEVER had a problem!!After owning a defective more expensive monitor, I was skeptical about this one.The reviews were a bit mixed and had me worried about interference and the range alarm going off.We have had this for 2 months now and use it mutiple times every day.I especially like the convenience of having 2 receivers, with a multi-level home, this is a must!I have often walked right outside her door while holding a receiver and the alarm has never gone off.And I have had no interference with this either; it is often sitting right next to my cell phone and right below our microwave with no problems.Great monitor, don't hesitate on buying this one!While there are some superficial flaws with this product (especially that the loop on top of the receivers is actually the antenna, and you can't use it to hang from your belt loops or anything convenient like that), it seems to work very well.We get crystal-clear reception everywhere in the house, even the basement.Unfortunately, the proximity alarm sounds if we're any farther than about 20 feet from the baby's room.If i'm going to stay that close, i don't need a monitor to hear what's going on in there.What good is a baby monitor that lets me go out of earshot of the baby long enough to be productive if it's constantly beeping at me?at his 6-month appointment, so we had to move up to the toddler seat.The good things:- It works with the same base so long as you have the seat rear facing (since our son is only 7 months old, we'll have him facing backwards a while longer)- I LOVE that you can turn the seat 90 degrees in the base to get him in and out of the car -- I've watched my friends with rear-facing convertable seats contort themselves to get their babies strapped in while I can stand comfortably at the side of the car;- Because the base system still works, we're able to get away with using one car seat for two cars- You can use it with the stroller base (handy when the baby is sleeping and you don't want to wake him up to put him in a stroller)- it has velcro tabs to keep the straps out of the way when getting the baby in and out of the seatThe not so good things:- It is heavy.I have a really hard time lifting it in and out of the car, especially with the baby in the seat;- You can use it with the stroller, but it looks really strange, plus it is hard to haul in and out of the car;- It is really big and, especially with the sun shade, blocks the side window view;- You can't use the base forward-facing (when our son turns 1, we'll just install this seat permanently in one car and buy a Britax for the other car).Thus, if you already have the infant system and a younger baby that has outgrown the infant car seat, this is a good option.but it's also a big pain in the butt.-in my 4-runner, i couldn't see anything out the rear view mirror with my rear-facing toddler car seat.SO frustrating.-there is no way i could lift my sleeping child, strapped into that thing, out of the car & onto the stroller.NO way.-there is no recline option for your sleeping child.my son weighed 22 lbs at 6 months old & required a toddler car seat.after 2 trips and seeing his poor little head in his lap, i was done.-and the obvious negative, once your child is forward facing, the infamous rotating base is obsolete.i am thrilled with my britax boulevard click safe.I am thrilled with my Orbit Baby toddler car seat and want to put to rest some of the issues others have brought up.The base is braced against the rear seat-back and prevents the seat from tipping forward and smashing your kid into the seat back in the event of a crash.This also protects you child's legs and makes it even safer to keep them rear facing as long as possible.Kids can sit fine with their legs crossed; lots of safety experts have commented that rear facing as long as possible is the way to go.There is no point in using the base (or any base) forward facing as it is very important to use the top tether to secure the seat tightly against the car's seat-back.Getting through the airport was such a breeze.I can't imagine trying to travel around a city and forgo using a car seat in taxi just because of the hassle and I'd hate using one of those car seat travel adapters where you push/pull your kid around about 5 inches off the ground, nasty!The gray head protection pillow also moved down to the lowest setting and fits our guy perfectly.I wasn't nuts about spending another $360 on a big car seat and I noticed the above reviewer had purchased a Maxi Cosi Pria 70.Amazon had them on sale for near to the two hundred range so I purchased one and thought I'd try it out.I couldn't believe that Maxi Cosi (actually Doral group) was charging an extra two hundred bucks for some fancy padding.Come on people.The Maxi Cosi is a plastic shell and THAT'S IT!Can't wait for Obit to adjust their line for multi-kid families!Paying this much for a toddler seat had better be worth it, and it almost is.But you can't use that in the car, and of course it costs extra.This weight problem really prevents you from utilizing this as part of the travel system, which is the main reason say, you would buy an Orbit on top of another brand if you already have the Orbit Infant System.So they should just sell it as the best-designed and safest toddler car seat out there, because that's what it is.As far as comfort, safety, quality, materials, and workmanship, you are going to be hard-pressed to find a better seat, though.My daughter loves this, and even sleeps comfortably in it.I do recommend it, but think twice if you're buying it for its "portability" and practicality in a travel system... it's none of those things.This was my old review until the baby loved it:Don't buy this!!!First, while putting this together I noticed some little broken plastic pieces in the bag upon delivery.While putting this part together I noticed the bar wouldn't click into place like the other bars did.I then proceeded to put the back bar on.Instead of the top play bar going middle to back, it goes middle to feet now and there is no way of unlocking it once you assemble!I took apart over 7 screws and still couldn't unlock it!I'm stuck with a $40 piece of crap with no toy bar for the baby!#2  Actually it works fine backwards.The baby was born with hip dislocation and sleeping flat was painful for her with her harness.She slept comfortably in this chair (without the toy bar) for 2 months and now still sits in it to watch Elmo at 3.5 months old.I love this car seat!It looks and feels sturdier than any other car seat I've seen.Love the newborn cushion; my baby sat up very well in this seat from day one leaving the hospital (we did use a rolled blanket around his head for the first few weeks, but I think all newborns need extra head support in any car seat).Love that the handle can be pointed down to keep the car seat from rocking when on a hard surface, if needed.Highly recommend!ETA: It's March 2014 and I'm coming back to edit my review now that we have used this seat with baby #2 for 4 months.We used it with baby #1 until he was 11 months old (too tall).The fabric held up beautifully and looked like new for baby #2 (granted #1 didn't spit up in it EVER, and wasn't a drooler...unlike kiddo #2.ahem.).The buttons on the handles that you have to push in are a bit "sticky" now and usually have to be pushed several times before you find that "sweet spot" so that they will both go in and you can change the handle position.This wasn't a problem the last time we used it, and I'm not sure why 3 years of storage in our climate-controlled closet would have caused it.Still love the seat, but the finicky buttons this time around are extremely annoying.While it is heavy, it is very safe.One note though, when we took this to the hospital to be tested with our child, the nurses did not know how to operate it and told us we had to buy a new one.Therefore, don't expect this seat to be as simple as cheaper ones but it won't require a degree in rocket science.The SIP cannot be removed from the seat.Moreover, the fact that this fits with ANY of the Peg Perego strollers sealed the deal for us.Moreover, our child was born premature and under five pounds and, with the insert provided by the hospital, she fits in it with no problem.Also, the nurse stated that the base appears to fit tighter than any other car seat base she has seen in her many years at the hospital.Setting the seat up is very easy and the base stays tight and snug with many removals of the seat.I am 5'10" and very strong--no shrinking violet here--but even I had a hard time carrying this around.I would always wonder what a petite woman would do if she had to lug this car seat around with a growing infant sitting in it.Heavy is an understatement.It is the safest on the market and about half the price.Do yourself a favor and skip this one!I bought this car seat thinking that it was the absolute safest thing out there and was thus willing to overlook its ridiculous weight.I seriously curse it every time.My baby is 12mo now and about 23 lbs and she's getting too big for it (her feet have to almost straddle the seat!We had a Graco seat for my daughter when she was an infant 5 1/2 years ago.I saw it and tested it out in person and found that it was indeed much heavier than most other infant carseats--one of the drawbacks I've found, but I will say that over the 5 months we've had it I have gotten a workout lugging it around.A few more complaints--it is sometimes difficult to lift out of the car because of it's weight (and with a 20-lb baby in it it's hefty), so with that said it is being left in the car more often than not for a few weeks now.I was looking for a carseat for my new, and third, baby.Gracos are everywhere and the Chicco (the third compatible infant seat) has UGLY patterns.So I decided to find a store that sold the Peg to see if the reviews here were right.Let me tell you this- heavy is not the word to describe this seat.I am FIT, and am pretty strong, and when lifting it I could not even imagine ever wanting to carry this around with anymore added weight.Strollers and Snap and Gos cannot be used everywhere, even though they are convenient and easy.Picking something up at someone's house, visiting people, carrying it in and out of your own house, carrying it into church, etcetc...Anyway, I don't want anyone to make a mistake here.I'll do a list of pros and cons.Pro:Love the very high quality fabrics and materials on the car seat.Love the consumer reports high crash test rating.The side impact pads are a big bonus.The car seat base attaches quickly and easily to the car using the latch system.The seat straps are very quickly and easily adjustable.Con:It's heavy, but I suppose a 30lb car seat will be heavier.The baby shade awning lines up directly with the carry handle.I really wish I still saved the box.This thing died after 3 weeks- and it now turns itself on without any reason that I can see- completely random.Not great, because in the middle of the night, it'll go off (with no water in it) stink up the room, then beep incredibly loud.It's smelly, hard to clean, over or underheats according to the instructions- has warped my medela bottle, and the beep is ridiculously loud.I'm gonna toss it and get something better.What a shame!i dont get the bad reviews because this bottle warmer works great for me.it does take a little time to get the hang of it but once you do it works great!but i have never had problems with hot spots.the only reason i gave four stars is because it does get a little gunk from water after multiple uses but i just clean it with a clorox wipe or soak it with vinegar.it is expected to get a little dirty due to constant moist-heat build up.the sterilizer for nipples and pacifiers is awesome-i use it all the time.however-i have used this bottle warmer for only two weeks so i dont know how long it will last but it is great so far!definately would recommend or buy again!fyi-i heat up pumped breat milk if that helps anyone and i use many types of bottles (drop ins, 6 oz-9oz bottles) so it works great with varietyAfter reading all the reviews, I decided to try the product anyway.The sound of the beep doesn't bother me at all, but then again my bedroom is fairly removed from the kitchen.The problem I have with this product is that it really overheats the bottle!Even though I followed the guidelines and instructions, the milk was always waaay too hot, and I ended up needing to cool it on ice.In other words, it would have taken just as much time to just float the bottle in a thermos of hot water.I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.I made the mistake of buying this and one month later I had to get a Dr. Browns one, is like they say you get what you pay for, that's exactly what happens with this warmer wich is not consistent, forms a nasty build up very difficult to remove not even vinager and the beeping is so loud!but with the bottle warmer they need to improve a lot.Other than that the pacifier sterilizer is pretty good idea.When we use it to do the print of our daughter's hands and feet we were a little bit worried because the ink did not go away easily!Beside that it's a good product!I ordered the black ink pad.It didn't look very high quality.But I was wrong!I did hand prints and foot prints for the baby book as well as prints on multiple Christmas cards for family.All in all, it worked well for what I needed it for and now I have it for future use!I bought this for my baby book i am making and every month i do her hand and foot print.i put it in a ziplock bag which seems to keep it fresh.comes of babys hands with a baby wipe and doesn't seem to leave any rash :)I purchased this product thinking I could use it to ink my 3 month old son's hands and feet to save his baby prints.The ink pad is actually really tiny, which made it hard to get the ink onto my son's hands and feet, since I had to keep turning it in different directions and at different angles to get the ink on him (though I think more ink ended up on me and the table).If the pad was larger, it would have been so easy to just press his foot on it, then onto a paper.Sigh.I haven't tried it again because it was such a hassel.But, while ink did get all over, it washed off fairly easily - which is a plus.I'd recommend this for small stamps, or if you have something to roll on it, then onto your baby's hands or feet.With a squirmy baby, you probably will need to take a couple of attempts before getting a good one and there's not enough ink to get it done.Couldn't even attempt the hands.I ended up using a water based non toxic paint that I had on hand.I shouldn't have wasted my money on this one.This ball is perfect for babies just learning how to crawl, roll or grab for things they want.They are ordering one too.Ours came in green.Because it is easy to grab and hold, I find it is a great toy to store in the diaper bags for trips in the car and restaurant entertainment - although it is not impervious to the occasional catapult across the room.This was one of the first toys that my son could easily grab and hold onto for any length of time.Now he likes to fling it!We bought it at a local toy store.It's so easy for him to hold onto and handle.I have the feeling that one of these balls will be going everywhere with us for awhile!I used to give Manhattan Toy's Winkel as my default toy gift for babies but I think I'll switch to the O-Ball Rattle from now on.And because it's a ball, it really holds up as a toy through any age.For that matter, I'm 33 and I love looking at the little rainbow balls in the plastic pockets throughout the ball.He was just starting to learn to use his hands.He shakes it all around and just stares at it.We bought this for our daughter before she was born not realizing it's versatility.She still uses it to this day, and she is now 10 months old.It's easy to grip and just loud enough to get her excited.I noticed my son becomes interested in toys that make make noise and is able to shake.The only problem is he likes to trow it!So I used one of those pacifier clips to keep it close to him.I clip one side to his onesie and the other velcros to the ball.Easy fix.I can also use the pacifier clip to attach it to his activity center or his stroller.Totally durable, totally fun.Definitely one of his favorite toys - highly recommend!I don't have much new to add, besides another 5 star review.He enjoys tossing the ball to us.My 8 m/o twins did not get too excited about this toy.However, I think that it's a nice addition to our toy box and hopefully they will grow to love playing with it.I like that this toy has no PVC, Latex, Phthalates, or BPA.Made by Rhino Toys, Inc., manufactured in China.Update: it did become one of the toys to fight for - it rattles, it rolls, is easy to grab, and even can jump if thrown against the floor.Not sure why there is a warning about small parts - the little rattling balls seem to be safely encased in the transparent plastic windows.My daughter enjoys this toy, but appears to want to eat it so when she can't eat it, she doesn't enjoy it too much.Yes, I know it sounds a little funny, but she'll shake it around and throw it on the ground, pick it up and then try to stick it in her mouth.Once she can't do it, she moves on.It's well built, durable and easily cleanable (is that even a word?)and entertains her for a few minutes at a time.From the time that I put this in front of her she did not stop cooing.There are some things such as the detachable fish that she can't use yet, but I like the fact that this will still keep her interest even when the tummy time is a thing of the past.I recommend whole heartedly!!We used this (in conjunction with a Boppy) to see if this would help him stay on his tummy longer and SURE enough it did!!It was so great to see him looking in the mirror and smiling and playing with the goldfish.The other plus is that when tummy time is over and he starts sitting up he can play with the birds and the peek-a-boo sides as well.I also love the fact that it can fold up and go where we go without being big and bulky.Overall I love this and feel it was a great purchase for a desperate Mom during tummy time!You have been warned.I got what I guess is the older model with no teether & instead of a fish-food rattle, the fish itself is the rattle & you only get to birds not 3.I would easily pay twice as much for this and still be satisfied!You won't be dissapointed if you get one, thats all I can say!He immediately snuggle with the blanket, and now he sleeps with it around his arm every night.I really like this Halo sleep sack.Our baby sleeps very well when she's swaddled in it.I ordered the second sack, because my husband just loves the fact that our baby can't get out of it at night.The only thing I'm not crazy about is velcro on the actual swaddling part.If you undo it, but leave the "wings" on, your baby can scratch herself.So you have to completely remove it, and then put it back for the next night, and it's not very easy to remove it when the sleep sack is still on your baby.I feel that other similar products did a better job by putting the velcro on the tabs that can be closed just by themselves, so the baby is still in the sack, but can't scratch herself.There is nothing really special about it, but nothing really wrong with it either.Unfortunately, the stroller didn't fit in our car, so we ended up using a Snap & Go with the carseat.It is really hard to turn the stroller at slow speeds or from a full stop, you have to back up and kind of get a bit of a running start.I don't really recommend or not recommend this one, it is totally average and adequate.These spouts worked with my Nuby sippy cups and were a good price.I'm sure my boy will bite through them just like the originals, but I won't complain that this is a quality issue, just a bad habit from the baby!These spouts break easily with a teething toddler, but it's nice to be able to replace them and not have to waste the whole cup.The soft spouts were great for a beginning sippy cup user, but now that my son can drink from the harder spout, we'll buy those type of cups instead.I like that it's hard for our little one to get open- he just can't.I have no problem with it, just push in on the texture part and twist.The problem I have with it is the netting is so long he just holds that instead of the handle, so he's covered in whatever food is in the netting.Avocado, not such a big deal, but apples are sticky and he was a mess.Maybe another brand has a shorter netting but I haven't checked.big enough for her small hands to hold.Replacement nets are a lil bit difficult to clean but if put in water just after use, this will help.I will definately recommend.The description said the baby wouldn't be able to open this and that is true because I have a hard time.I like the single stick-type handle and the net comes completely detatched for cleaning.When placed under the nipple in the nipple collar these are supposed to prevent leakage and they do a little bit, but not to the degree that I would use them to take liquid bottles with me.I use these for when I premake a bottle with just the premeasured powder formula in it and don't add the water yet.I put the premeasured water in another bottle and use the travel caps for the liquid.Do not buy these unless you plan on using them like I do.I have twins on different flows and they are hard to tell apart - especially in the middle of the night.Second, these bottles leak so badly.I have followed all of the instructions and have several of the bottles, but each of them drip terribly.You need to wash your hands and arms after feeding the kid, and they don't travel well, even with the little disks they provide to stop leakage.Lastly, with the caps the bottles are longer than standard bottles, so you can forget about fitting them in any bottle holders, coolers, or standard diaper bag bottle pockets.I actually don't mind all of the parts; some other bottles out there are worse.After I read the great reviews about these bottles and from my girlfriend, I went out and purchased 2 sets of these bottles and all new level 2 nipples and the rack set - I thought I was set.I never thought these bottles would be made in China - I don't know, with all the news about the high levels of lead found in baby products manufactured there, it made me wonder why Dr. Browns would even produce them there.But I'll stick to the review of these bottles, they were a pain to CLEAN, ASSEMBLE and DISASSEMBLE - and because of all the little parts, you really needed to buy the big and bulky Dr. Brown Rack (so keep this in mind if you don't have storage space).BTW, in case you were wondering, my girlfriend who told me these were great bottles later confessed and said she hated them because of all the time it took to clean them, but was stuck using them because her kids were used to them.We got these after trying avent, medela, nuk, breastflow and a few others.I thought I found the answer to my son's excessive gas/acid reflux in these bottles as it seemed he reacted right away by burping less during feedings.However, after a week or so- I noticed leaking.A LOT of leaking.This includes the glass bottles and the plastic.I tried taking them apart, reassembling, making sure the nipple was pressed in all the way, unscrewing the lid, tightening the lid, switching parts...I pump exclusively and fill these bottles.It leaks so much we have to wrap a towel around the bottles while feeding!I'm NOT happy I've spent over $25 on dr brown's bottles for this to happen.I JUST threw away the packaging, of course!I wish I could return them and get my money back.That is an excellent product.1 out of 5 babies have it- and supposedly drs now think colic is actually stomach acid burning the baby's esophagus.You can DO something about their pain.There is no such thing as "colic."For 7 weeks I had an EXTREMELY gassy/colicky baby.I opted to purchase glass bottles in the beginning and not use the plastic drop-ins because I was concerned about BPA.I actually thought that the formula was the problem... and my pediatrician never mentioned anything about these bottles (she only mentioned the plastic BPA drop ins which made me kind of mad!).I ran out to purchase them (needed them right away, could not wait for Amazon) and used them on the next feeding.It worked!I noticed immediate results... my daughter wasn't arching her back, wriggling all over the place, crying or being fussy after her feeding, etc.She also didn't need to be burped as often.I gave this product 4 stars because the bottles are not leak proof and there are a few extra parts to clean which can be a pain when washing by hand.After spending hundreds of dollars on bottles this is the only one she would use.Ignore the reviews that comment on the numbering on the bottles.Our daughter has colic and reflux, therefore these are the only bottles we'll use!The polypropylene bottles better preserve the good aspects of breast milk.I don't know if I will buy any more though as I don't notice that he prefers it over the Breastflow, don't notice he has less gas than with Breastflow, and that one doesn't leak.They're great for a number of reasons:1) The design prevents the baby from taking in extra air, cutting down on gas and burping, which in turn cut down on spit-ups.2) Completely BPA free3) Well made, high quality plastic.They're firm but not inflexible, shatter proof, and easy to hold.4) Great heat transfer for heating up cold bottles (we heat them using hot water and a glass that is a bit wider in circumference than the bottle.Just pour in about half a glass of hot water, put in the bottle, let it sit for a minute or two and you're ready to go.No mess, and if you want the bottle a bit warmer, just repeat with a bit more hot water).5) Exchangeable nipples--you can keep the bottle but swap out the nipple as your baby growsA few thoughts:Those complaining that they are made from too many parts are missing the point: the bottles have the additional parts to cut down on unwanted air intake as your baby drinks their milk.That means that your baby has fewer spit ups.It's a time saver in the long run.Bottles are easily washed.Babies and clothing not so much.To those who have experienced leaks: It's likely that either you have not installed the rubber stopper correctly, or that you have a defective stopper.In the first instance, check to make sure your stopper is lined up and inserted according to the instructions.If you're still having leaks, send the bottle(s) back and get replacements.Amazon will happily send you a new one, and if it's outside their window, contact Dr. Brown directly.Conclusions:These are a must buy if you want high quality plastic bottles.There are so many bottles to choose from, it is hard to know what your baby will like.I went with these per a recommendation from a friend and I'm glad that I did.I haven't used any other bottles so I don't have anything to compare these to.Yes, they are a pain to clean!There are so many little nooks that sometimes I miss a spot and that part starts to grow mold so I end up having to buy replacement parts, which are not cheap.Other than that, these have worked out for my baby since birth.I bought one of the plastic bottles and 6 of the glass bottles.So I do recommend sticking to the plastic version.I am totally impressed with this as well as the functionality of the venting system.I'm pretty sure (don't ask me how) that he actually consumes less air with these bottles than breast feeding.For diapers, I think they're superior to prefolds because they can be folded in more ways, and if you just fold them in quarters, you have a prefold anyway.I usually fold them in quarters, then in thirds, lay them in a simple diaper cover, and wrap the whole thing around baby's bum.Even in the dryer, these dry faster than prefolds, saving you energy costs.These are also terrific for other uses: I've used them as a burp cloth, a bib for my messy eater, and for general cleanup around my baby.Later I intend to use them as kitchen cloths and rags.These are so much better than the Gerber diapers!Very sturdy and a good size (the Gerber diapers shrink badly and shred easily).I was looking for the quality of what we were given by the hospital, and found exactly what I wanted!We mainly use them as burp cloths, but also as small drop cloths when we put our daughter down on something.But, the return process was so easy, I had the whole thing packaged and ready to go in 10 min and in 24 hours, the wrong parts were gone.In 36 hours, the refund had been completed.No questions asked.This product is exactly as advertised.It is efficient and does the job it is supposed too.This way I have less to remember and less stuff to cart around.With my first baby (& first pump) I caused a near catastrophe when I forgot to put my breastshields back into the pump bag to go to work with me... discovered at 11pm (I work at night).My husband AND the baby had to get into the car to bring them to me- fortunately baby slept through the whole thing.You already spent a wad of cash on the pump, go ahead and spend a few more dollars to avoid repeating the above scenario (although you still have to remember the pump :)).I also highly reccomend the microwave steam clean bags- a great way to keep your parts clean and all together.2 things people hate while they are shopping: crying children, while parents 'tune it out' (instead of removing them until calm) and Running wild children.It provides safety and is considerate of other shoppers.I will often tie one end to either the stroller or the shopping cart.We love these spoons!They are soft so they don't hurt baby's mouth, shallow so it's easy to get food off (at this age you swipe the food off in their mouth, they don't use their lip to dig it out), and last a long time.We tried the Munchkin spoons as recommended in other reviews, but the bowl is WAY too deep- there's no way a beginning eater can clean it out, and it's really wide making any attempt to use their lips very difficult.Stick with these!A spoon's a spoon, it gets the job done.I purchased these over others because they're BPA free.Not sure how they hold up in the dishwasher as I choose to handwash all his stuff, but I'm happy with my purchase and would buy them again.(6-9 months)I got these spoons because it was traditional.All babies seem to start with these types of spoons.The spoon well was so shallow that food just ran off it and she didn't get much with each bite.The handle was also short and uncomfortable for me to hold.It just didn't sit right in my hand.I quickly switched (within a week) to the Munchkin brand and was 10 times happier with those ones.Her gums were fine and boy does she bite down, and they are BPA free and safer for her to play with now that she tries to take it from me.And the comfort for my feeding her is so much better with the long plastic ones over these short metal rubber ones.I think these weren't necessary and a waste of money since I only used them for about a week, but I got them because being a first time mom, I thought that's what all babies started out with.They are the perfect handle size for my daughter to use and I love the soft BPA free silicone on the end.Initially tried the Baeba infant spoons for my daughter.She was miserable, as the spoon was too big and deep for her.I had to buy more!I've looked at tons at local baby stores to high end specialty shops, and this is high quality satin and microfiber, for a very reasonable price.The blanket specifications clearly state how large the blanket is, so some of the other bad reviews didn't make sense to me.I made the mistake of reading a good few reviews and purchasing.I read the other reviews so I saw the measurements beforehand.When I received the blanket today I handed it to my little guy and he started laughing and cuddling it right away---he loves it.it fits great (size large, 12 months old ,23.5 lbs) and still roomy.although it does not hold pee (neither do the little swimmers)you can wear it as many times as you want and clorine won't damage them!When we announced our pregnancy, all of our friends told us we NEEDED a swing so we bought the Starlight version of this swing and had it assembled before he was born.For the first 3 weeks of his life, he absolutely hated the swing and cried every single time we put him in it.I thought we had wasted our money.Well, we tried it again when he was just over 3 weeks old, and I don't know what happened, but all of the sudden it became his favorite place to take a nap.He falls asleep almost immediately when we put him in the swing.If your baby hates this swing at first, don't give up on it!I'm so glad we didn't pack it away.I also love that the Starlight version can be plugged in.We have this thing going for hours at a time, so it's nice to not have to change batteries even though we have to maneuver around the power cord in our kitchen.For those who are concerned about the color, the mobile toys and pillow are baby blue, but the cushion, the fabric that's lining the net, and the dials are lilac.We returned the swing.Our family did not like this swing.The mobile does not swing out of the way and hits baby's head when you try to put them in while sleeping.You MUST strap them in (not alway practical) because the sides are low and baby can turn over and roll out.It's very nice and soothing.The fact that you can have it swing different ways it's a big plus.This swing is perfect for our 9 week old baby girl for an afternoon nap or an unconsoleable crying fit.I wouldn't recommend ever nap because she needs to learn how to sleep without the swinging, but it really helps her out when she needs it.Sometime she gets overstimulated with being held and needs some alone time to fall asleep and this works great.has used this swing since his first week home.He often will take his morning nap in it.The little lamb motifs fit in well with our home decor and doesn't scream baby land.I would recommend the swing to anyone.This swing has served us well.My son is now 8 months and has spent MANY hours in the swing.For a few months, he actually slept in it at night because it was the only way he would sleep!He still naps in it.You can read all the rave reviews about the swing in the other reviews -- I just want to point out my two biggest gripes.1) The swing runs on batteries.Considering how much time my son has spent in this swing, I really wish it was a plug-in.I know the Zen swing is similar and plugs in.You can not sit your baby up when they are older to play with the toys.We have never used the toy bar.Other than those two issues, it's a great buy and my son loves it.I registered for this swing for my son as it was one of the few non-feminine swings I could find.I thought it was very cute & gender neutral.I have been extremely disappointed.The motor on it is a joke and what's worse, we exchanged it & had the same problems so I know it isn't just one bad swing.The motor is loud enough that we thought it was broken when we first tried it out, but what's worse is it barely has the power to swing my 12 pound son.Literally, if I leave it to swing on its own, it swings ONE INCH either way with my son in it & he is only half the recommended weight capacity.Even when he was newly born (8 lb's), it barely swung him.So I sit by the swing & push it manually.Also, the recline is not flat enough for a newborn because my son's head rolls forward & he slumps in the chair no matter what I do.Not only would I not buy this swing again, but after all the product recalls I've seen in the news, I'd be reluctant to purchase anything Fisher-Price in the future.When he was 7 1/2lbs I tried to put him in the swing but even on the lowest setting it was going WAY too fast and he didn't seem to like it either.I tried the swing again about 3 weeks later when he was around 10lbs and on the lowest setting it was perfect.My baby falls right to sleep and stays asleep.He loves to look at himself in the mirror on the mobile and listen to the nature sound with the stream and birds.Pros:- One button to change the swing from front to back to side to side- Sturdy and stable- One step to change from laying down to sitting up- Has an option for the swing to stay still but the music and/or mobile to still be on- Reset button to restart the music and/or mobile- Very plush and comfy- Decent battery lifeCons:- Too fast for a baby under 9-10lbs in my opinion- Would be great if it had an a/c adapter.I would definately purchase this swing again.He sleeps longer in this swing than in his bouncers, crib or carseat so I have more time to take a nap or get things done around the house.We got a traditional swing and tried to use it when my daughter was born.However, due to the angle of the seat, my daughter's pediatrician recommended we find a swing that could lay flat to support her neck.The tray is removable so we were able to swaddle our daughter (in my other life saver by Swaddle Designs) and place her in this swing to rock to sleep as if she was in the newborn napper that came with our pack & play.My daughter is now 6 months old and we still enjoy the swing for her day naps.It has always been a napper.She is just now starting to notice the mobile and mirror on top.When she wakes up she will stare up at herself and bat at the stars and lambs.One other thing I liked was the angles you could place the swing.Left (front to back), Right (front to back) or Forward (side to side).I started used the side to side motion for a while and found she did better with the front to back motion.My biggest criticism is the battery.I ran through D's a lot in the beginning as we would run it every day for hours on end.If it's available on the new models of this swing I'd give it 5 stars.My only other criticism is the legs.You need a lot of space to spread them out.We had a system of rotation with the batteries to be sure the swing was always working.Do yourself a favor and invest in rechargeable batteries.Our son is now too big for the swing but it will be used for #2 for sure!We originally had the graco sweetpeace swing which was the worst purchase EVER.I decided to pick this up and I am glad I did!!My daughter is 10 months and still fits in it but we put it away for the next baby.But this was the best, it's so soft..the motions are so soothing.It's an overall really good product.I'm sad to hear that other reviewers had a bad experience  but everyone I know has this swing with no issues.Fisher price has one of the best customer service I have ever seen so they will exchange out for a new one asap.So when i had my second son i wanted to buy a cradle swing for him too.Well when i put it together it looked like it was tilted to the left.I thought maybe it was just me so i tried to forget about it.A few days later it was still leaning to the left.So i called fisher price to tell them what was going on and they said they'd send me a new motor mount.(like it's happened before)  I got the new one and installed it and the same thing happened.So everytime my son is in the swing he is always leaning to the left of the swing.It's a little annoying considering how much we paid for the swing.The swing itself is very cute and super soft.I am not talking about normal "motor" type noises, I am talking about loud and obnoxious noises.It sounded as though it was working double time just to swing (no baby involved).So we put some weight in it to see if it would help, nope.We thought maybe we hadn't put it together correctly, nope we did it right.So we returned it and got another.Guess what?!?The new swing made the exact same noises.Ugh!I had to give in and decided the cuteness factor did not outweigh the loudness of the swing.We returned it and got a Bright Starts Ingenuity Swing...absolutely silent and just as cute!At first, he showed little interest in it, but as he grew older, he started liking it more and more.I like that it is small and compact, plays a variety of tunes, isn't too loud, lights up, and has the rolling rattle feature.At 11 months now, my son still enjoys this toy.It's not his favorite, but as long as I cycle through his collection every few days, he continues to find it interesting again and again.He'll stay on his tummy playing with me and this toy for well over half hour.This is my son's favorite toy and has convinced him that tummy time is not that bad after all.He loves the lights and songs and likes hitting the keys and the rattle.He has spit up on it several times now (in between the keys too) and it is still going strong!The songs are actually nice to listen to, not annoying at all!Great for getting him to sit in the bumbo too.I love this bathtub.My son is 4 months old & not sitting up yet.He's too big for the infant side.He wiggles around a lot & his bum is always sliding up over the bump.His head is so high up now it's hard to rinse it without getting water everywhere.I wish there was more of that non stick foam in there or there was a lower setting to move the bump to.It's sturdy & easy to clean & he loves the little whale cup, he lifts his feet up so I can sprinkle it over them.It is nice and big and offers room for baby to grow.The contoured stopper is great for little ones and easily removable for when baby is able to sit up on his own.Easily props on kitchen sink or sits in bathroom tub...I wanted to purchase this tub for my baby but when I went to get it, they were out of stock.I'm so glad that I waited and got it instead of another one.The only thing I would kind of like is non-slip grips on the bottom of the legs.I have a small apartment and so the tun doesn't fit over the sink.This tub is great because:-it fit in my sink-it was stable on my mother's bathroom counter-I forgot about the "legs" and use it in my tub now, with no stability issues-it is easy to clean-it worked well for my baby with the width, height, depth, and cushion-it is still perfect for my large 18 month old so I don't have to fill an entire tub-it's cute-the orange fish is also easy to clean (no mold like in the squirter toys)-the orange fish is strangely fun for my childAll of my friends got the summer infant one with the sling--the sling seems hard to clean and not easy to use.I have a hand-me-down of that one without the sling; it doesn't seem to fit my toddler well.The top-rated review pretty much says it all!This tub is great, because it has a separator which is great for newborns by providing support against sliding down.The baby is very comfortable in it and it fits in the kitchen sink.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it is hard to let the water out of it with the baby in it, because the hole for letting the water out is on the left side and you have to tile the tub to let the water gush out of it, not a big deal just a little bit of a hassle that's all.The little whale toys is also great to pour water over the baby and for him to grab on to.We have used this till our son was 7 months old.The reason I gave it a four star & not a five is because its hard to take out the bump thing that holds him up and ....when we took it out even though he is long he would slide down.they really should have put something in it to make it not so slippery.The tub is really cute, and it's easy to use since you can have both your hands free and don't need to hold an infant up with one.My little one also loves the fish that comes with it.We use it to sprinkle water over his belly and keep him from getting cold during his bath.The tub is really is to clean as well (you don't have to worry about mold growing on it like tubs with the slings).They need to be cleaned with Q-tips as crud gets lodged in there.- There isn't much support for an infant (tub is best for 3 mo +)- It never fit over my kitchen sink.I tried to use the tub over the sink (a single stainless steel 'regular' sink), it never worked.We always had to set it up on the counter or table.- You can't pop the drain with the tub resting on something, so if the tub is in your bathtub, you can't drain the water with the baby in it.- The tub was too small by the time my son was 8 months old, we moved on to a larger toddler size cheapo plastic tub.It's pretty much the same thing, just supersized.PROS:- It looks cute.- The toy is a huge hit.Really cute, really functional.- The green bump kept the baby from sliding down, the tub is large enough for play time.Altogether, I wasn't disappointed.If I did it over again, I think I would have stuck with my original tub choice, "4moms Cleanwater Infant Bath Tub with Digital Thermometer" - running clean water through the tub the whole time would probably beat using a cup to rinse off at the end of the bath, and once the baby starts crawling around, they do get rather dirty.He got FOUR baby baths that day, but this one was by far the cutest of them all.I am confident he will be returning the other ones and keeping mine :)I gave it 3 stars because it worked better at certain ages than others.NEWBORN:We had to hold his head from flopping to the side and he was too short for his butt to rest on the green butt-bumper so it was functional but logistically a bit tricky.His head rested comfortably on the green foam (although not too cushy, just a non-slip type pad), and his butt could rest on the green bumper to keep him from sliding down.He can splash and play and we can still lay him down if needed.----The orange cup with holes in the bottom was a hit at every age and we'll use it long after he fully outgrows the tub.She started splashing around and playing with the water a month ago (she just turned 3 months).The green "stopper" is the best invention ever.I'm so glad I read the reviews on this tub and decided to buy it instead of other expensive tubs.I don't use the green legs that you screw to the bottom of the tub, I don't feel like they are necessary for my kitchen sink, maybe later on if I decide to bathe my little one in the bathtub I might screw them in.The hole also seems to fit my sons bottom well (ie.One other thought I purchased another cheaper brand of potty seat which the hole in the seat was round and big plus when my son sat on it he fell through the hole and his bum touched the ground.Not good at all!One part that is helpful is this is high enough when set up to be about the same height as any other portable potty.Imagine that.I purchased this potty to replace a (Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus), and although I liked the 2-in-1 potty I was just getting tired of replacing the bags, they are hard to find by us, and pretty expensive when you use it as often as we do.This new Travel Potty Chair uses gallon size ziplock bags, which can be found anywhere, including the dollar store!I have also found it works quite well with Diaper Disposal Bags, or doggie disposal bags.I like using the diaper diaposal bags best since I think it is easier to grab and tie closed.But no matter which bag type you choose it is mess free, and clean up is a cinch.It is also helpful to note that you can put several of the diaper disposal bags on at a time, so that you can strip the used one and have another ready to go immedietly.I can even fold it up with the bags on.Saves some time from trying to prepare in a hurry as well.We mainly keep this unit in the car for use when a potty isn't around.We take it and fold it while at the park, a soccer game, or the zoo.Sometimes the nearest restroom is just too far away!The other benefit to note is that it looks more like a toilet since it actually has a little toilet seat that opens and closes(where you put the bags in)which may help some children adapt to it more quickly.Never had any leaky bags, and I don't have any problem opening the pockets or folding it as some pople mentioned.Maybe it is more difficult if you have long finger nails(which i do not) since you do have to push and open...overall I find this seat to be a great buy!Potty training was going great at home, but out with BIG toilets and the pressure to go while in the public restrooms... Not so great.I love that this potty folds down like a brief case.has two storage areas...I keep one filled with clean one gallon bags and a few wipes.My little girl over shoots routinely.I keep it in my car trunk.I love that I can take out the soiled bag and put a clean one in, in less than a minute.It is sturdy enough for my toddler, but I don't know how strong it actually is....hopefully by the time she weighs more than 30-40 lbs she will have no problems peeing in public restrooms.Overall very satisfied with this product.It was itchy and very thin.I wouldn't want to lay on it with no clothes on either.It does cushion the baby's head, but this foam cushion is barely large enough for a newborn.In a couple months, it will only be big enough to support the baby's head.The rest of their body will hang off, and you can imagine that that gets a little uncomfortable!The foam isn't particularly soft either.When my son was born he freaked out in a baby bath so I put this pad in my bathroom sink to give a little cushion and keep my baby from sliding.He did much better in the cozy little sink.This pad is not thick which for me was perfect because I went from the sink to sitting on a stool in my shower and putting the pad on my lap and I lay my son on my lap and again the pad keeps him from sliding and I use a hand held shower head to bathe him on my lap and he LOVES it!He is now 8 months and I still bathe him this way.He sits in a BUMBO seat in the shower with me while I shower and when I sit and grab the green foam he starts to yelp and and giggle and wave his arms with excitement.It lasted 7 months without falling apart at all until I made the mistake of letting my son play with it and he bit it and ripped the head off so this is purchase #2.It got really good safty reviews, but I am not sure that it is any better than the 15 dollar ones you can get at Walmart or Target.These should not be used with any brand of infant car seat, they affect how the straps are used and make it impossible to secure baby correctly.If you look it up, you will see there have been instances shen these have been used and in an accident the babies shoulders came out of the seat straps.You CAN however use the car seat covers that just go over the top of the car seat without the back thing.There is a reason your car seat specifies not to add other additions to it.This is the most awesome product ever!My baby boy is just 2 months old and every time we have to go out to a doctor's appointment or something else, he seems not to notice the difference between being inside the car or being outside in the cold...he stays comfortably sleeping in his car seat, NO PROBLEM!After that is done you just re-attach the top cover using the zippers (just like you would when closing the front zipper on a jacket), sit your baby in the car seat and close the zippers half way up...voila!Although we bought cold weather clothes for our 4 month old, the bitter cold and snow would have made it terrible.The Bundle Me was great, it stayed connected to the infant carrier and created an easy, warm way to transport the baby without worry of wind or cold.This product was so great.He has been using it since we brought him home from the hospital.It is great not to have to bundle him up to go outside.It fits in our Chicco carseat well.A must have when you have a baby in the winter!There are better options available for securing cabinets.We are currently using the slide type lock on other cabinets (no complaints or problems with these), but we wanted to try this product on an entertainment center because this product is less conspicuous.However, the hook portion of the product is too thick to use on knob style handles.Also, the handles must be spaced a good distance apart because the hooks do not slide all the way together.The gap on our entertainment center was too large (3" apart).We also tried to use it on a kitchen cabinet with conventional handles, but it was not very secure.This may be a usable product in the exactly right situation, but I don't know what that would be.I bought these (vs other brands) because it looked a bit more stylish...and because we're in a rental and don't want to drill or leave adhesive if we can help it.However, it was a mistake.These are such a pain in the butt to put on and take off that I hardly ever go into the cupboards that I put them on.So, if it's for cupboards that you hardly ever use, go for it.Instead, I finally just emptied the cupboard (guest bath) of anything dangerous.It's been months and I still hate them and now don't have the packaging or the receipt (at least they weren't terribly expensive).My title says it all.Chick -a-Fila use to have these available at thier restaurants and I used to take a couple at a time.They got smart and now only put them in the bags for kids meals.So, I purchased them here.I really don't think it matters what type of charater you get, it is just important to be able to put these down on the table in public restaurants.The mat stays in place with a sticky adheseve on the back.I feel good knowing that my baby is not eating off of a table that was probably cleaned by a dirty dishrag anyway!So my advice to you moms out there... Get these!Simply press into place.2.Very cheap (price, that is...see below for quality problems)Cons:1.If you have fingers bigger than the average 6 year-old, good luck getting these off when you need to.You either need to use a screwdriver to pry a corner while pushing the center "push tab", or tear your fingers up with extreme pressure.2.Push tab serves no purpose.It was SUPPOSED to add leverage to allow you to use one-hand to slide it out of the socket, but I always end up doing the following:A: Using my right hand's thumb and middle finger, grip the sides.B: Using my left hand's thumb, reach up in-between my right hand's death-grip and push hard on the center push  leverC: Using my left hand's pointer finger, reach over and down, in-between my right hand's grip, and pull at the top of the plugD: Apply steady, painful pressure on all points, until my fingers start to hurt, or it comes off3.Little fingers can more easily wiggle their points into the protector, kind of defeats the purpose...Overall: I DON'T LIKE IT - 2 STARSAvoided one star because of the price...I shouldn't have cheaped-out on these, spend a few more dollars, and gotten better ones.Caveat Emptor.This is a horrible product.Waste of money since I now have to throw them all out.My 17 month old just pulled one out without any problem.Useless and Dangerous!Don't waste your money.Just buy the cheapos that are more difficult for you and nearly impossible for your toddler to remove.The animals are cute and they turn as the mobile goes around which helps keep baby's attention.The only complaints I have are that it doesn't attach well to my crib and the light isn't very good.I had to attach this mobile to the short edge of my baby's crib rather than the longer side, because the edges on the long side are curved.Right now I have the mobile attached to the side of a chair so I can keep it in my front room where the baby plays.My husband assembled this upon receipt, but it only played music and didn't have any movement.I called the manufacturer directly as indicated on an insert accompanying the assembly instructions.I received a prompt return call and the customer service representative asked me to try a few fixes while she waited on the phone.None of her suggestions worked, so she said she would send me a replacement part for what she thought was the faulty piece.I called back and was told that they would try sending a different replacement part.This time it took two weeks for me to receive that part, but it worked.I was frustrated that it took three weeks to get a working mobile, given how quickly babies grow at this age.We've been using it for a few weeks now and he still seems very entertained.If you have anything fancier than a bare bones crib (such as one that converts to a toddler bed) it likely won't fit it as it only attaches to side rails that are less than about 2.5 inches.We change his diaper in the crib and turn on the mobile.Even if he is crying, as soon as he hears the music or happens to open his eyes, his focus is on the mobile and then he starts smiling.Sometimes it even stops singing and just spins and sometimes it makes a loud sound and stops.I read the reviews before I purchased this item and other people complain of the same issue but I though they just got a bad one that they weren't all like that but mine no longer works effectively.DON'T BUY, INVEST IN A MOBILE THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK!!I was at first upset that the mobile did not fit our Pali crib - however I was able to rig it (I tightened the screw enough that the mobile was clamped against two vertical slats.The mobile base is supposed to clamp on the vertical crib bar, but allows only a certain width, and our crib was wider).He can be entertained by this for 20 minutes or more, which is the longest I have managed with any toy/activity.can lower the volume and even eliminate the music (still keeps baby entertained and allows mommy to make a phone call).3. looks sturdy, and much nicer than other mobiles that spin on a horizontal plane (our baby ignores such a mobile on his swing).4. long battery time.5.can choose to operate without the night light or music.6.when choosing to operate without music you can't hear the motor noise.Negatives:1. may not fit all cribs and info about fit is not posted on the box or product description.2.the night light does not attract baby's attention.3.the remote is unnecessary.4.the toys soemtimes get caught in my hair when I bend over to change the baby (because they are all different sizes and rotate on an angle).I bought this mobile when my daughter was about 5 weeks old, which was about 3 weeks ago.I turn it on a couple of times per day, when she is already calm, and she almost always appears very interested in both the circling animals and the music.I sometimes narrate the goings on, and sometimes just leave her to her own devices, and both ways are effective.Almost as important, I like the music and the twirling animals (the twirls are ingenious, by the way), which is quite different from my reaction to some of the more insipid music in other gizmos that is touted as children's music but which is actually just bad music.I purchased this mobile rather than the Nojo Jungle Tales mobile that matched the bedding set I ordered.My son enjoys lying in his crib and watching the animals move.I think my husband would agree that this is the best toy we have purchased for our daughter so far.She was 1 1/2 months when we purchased it and she is now 5-months.She LOVES watching the animals go around and stare down at her, and when they spin it is like an added bonus.When she was 3-months old she started screaming with joy at the animals and loves to smile back at them.She can spend long periods of time in her crib just enjoying the mobile, it is how I get a shower every day!Honestly, I think this toy helped her to like being in her crib.We just recently had to change the battery, and we use the mobile at lot.I purchased it because I saw a picture of it on amazon.com posted by a customer of it being used  on a playard.Also the first review I read specifically wrote that the baby now sleeps in the co sleeper because of this mobile.So I thought it would work on my co sleeper.This mobile plays music for a very long time.We have used it every night for the last year and have only had to replace the batteries twice (six month intervals).The remote is VERY handy.Must buy.I have 6 daughters and 15 grandchildren and am still buying baby items since I often babysit and still have two cribs in my house.In addition, I like that the hanging mobile portion of it can be removed and still leave the light/music attached to the crib --- which may come in handy very soon as my one grandson is 16 months old and will probably begin pulling them apart if I leave it on when he is using the crib.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this product.We find a nature, classical CD or other 'new agey' music is much better suited than the music on this mobile, but at least there is a variety on it!Our son didn't even get into the mobile until roughly the 6 week mark.By week 8 he was REALLY into the mobile and loves to watch it go around.Usually he'll wave his arms, kick his feet and snort snort snort!while watching it go around.Eventually he falls asleep after 20 minutes of excitement from this mobile.We are very please with the mobile.We lost the remote to the mobile, so we have to turn it on manually each time, which isn't a big deal if your crib or co-sleeper is next to the bed.The light on the mobile is dim enough so that he can see the  animals going around when we turn off the lights.I put this together and it is very cute.The colors go with my baby girls room very well (pinks and greens), but it would also work well with a boys room (blues, greens and oranges).I was very unhappy when I put it all together and the music did not play.I am excited to get the replacement part and HEAR the music that comes out of the very cute mobile.Hope it works or I will be very disappointed.I will review this product again if there is another problem, but I am hopping to LOVE this product and give it a 4 or 5 in the future.This is an excellent mobile!- It is colorful and has nice motion, but not too much.- It has a remote control, which means you can turn it off or on without getting out of bed, and without needing to wind it up repeatedly.- It has four melodies, all of them nice and not annoying for the grownups.- The animals are set so that they seem to look straight at the baby when they're at the lowest point, which delights her.- It's set at an angle so it doesn't make getting her out of the crib too difficult.- My baby loves it!She coos and talks to the animals, and can stay entertained by it for a long time (until she gets annoyed that they don't answer her, I think).This product has been designed well except for the motor which is noisy and annoying especially if you are using the mobile in mute.Well for some reason, it never did anything for my little one.She just plainly ignores it hence the rating of 4 stars.We've used it for the last 4 months and haven't yet had to change the batteries.We were able to easily install it on our crib (DaVinci Kalani Convertible) and it cannot be removed by baby.The stuff animals each rotate and that keeps my daughter amused for a long time.The music gets repetitive but at 9 months old she still loves it and it puts her right to sleep when we put it on.Also this mobile was priced lower than most I had searched for online and was a great deal.I just paid the same price at our local baby store for ONE solid cover for the Snack Trap.Doh!We returned it because I didn't like it at all.My husband went on their website to figure out how to properly use it.Once we figured it out, it was great...it was just figuring it out to begin with.I gave it 4 stars because of this (it shouldn't be complicated).My now 5 week old who has minor colic falls asleep in it and absolutely loves it!This sling IS NO GOOD.First of all, the plastic ring digs into me and my baby's head is always hitting it.It's a huge BAG, basically and there are better slings out there.All of the weight is on your shoulder so I cannot comfortably wear my baby.Too bad.I will buy the ERGO.PROS:* This is a very nice sling, very well made and durable.The elasticized sides are wide and confortable.The outside pocket is too small to put much but fits a slim wallet or car keys.It's also fairly comfortable once put properly on the shoulder (not near the neck)* Baby took a couple times to get used to it (start walking as soon as baby is secured inside to avoid the cries!)but, after a few times, she even seemed to look forward to be put so snugly in there.Obviously, it is very confortable for baby.Actually, it can calm down a fussy baby quite quickly if you walk: baby ends up asleep in just a few minutes everytime!* It's convenient when running errands where pushing a stroller would be a problem (like visiting administrations where you go through metal detectors or narrow stores).* I also have a Moby wrap but it is way too hard to put properly everytime.This sling is super easy to put on and off and so it is getting all the use.CONS:* You cannot easily raise your arms over head when wearing the sling (That's a problem if you want something stocked on a high shelf!* My baby does not like to be in it if I am not walking.I think the quality justifies the price.This has been a great product to have.I still use my hand to support him as well since I feel more comfortable by doing so.I bought this sling with the hopes of getting more done around the house.It is comfortable for me while wearing it definitely.My baby is not sure if she likes it though, sometimes she goes to sleep in it right away, and sometimes she cries and doesn't like it.It might just take a bit more time for her to get used to it.I'm sure most new parents and parents-to-be have read or heard about the CPSC warnings regarding positional asphyxiation of babies in slings.This is precisely the type of sling they are warning about.A baby should always be able to be placed upright, tummy-to-tummy in a sling and should always be well above the wearer's bellybutton close enough to be kissed!I love wearing my baby, but always do so safely and would never purchase a sling like this.If you want to wear your baby in a sling, buy a good ring sling (like a Maya or Ellaroo) and makes sure to search for online resources on how to correctly position your child.Good ring slings have a shoulder that can be spread for the mother's comfort and have no elastic or gatherings on the rails that would make it hard to adjust the depth of the pouch (though they may have lightly padded rails for baby's comfort).Please buy a good, safe sling for your baby and take the time to learn to use it.I absolutely LOVE this sling for our 4 month old daughter.She loves to sit in it sideways w/ her head out like the picture shows when we go shopping so she can look around (or look out around the house for that matter).I get comments on it wherever I go.It's easy to put in a diaper bag to carry out and about too.LOVE THIS THING!!!I wish I'd had it for my other children.I am just not a sling fan.I tried about every type of carrying device for my baby because she was so fussy.I got this because I read Dr. Sears fussy baby book.My baby was hyperalert from a very young age and by 3-4 months, I kid you not, she could get out of the sling, she would pull and rip at it and try to throw herself overboard.Same thing with the Moby wrap(gift), it worked while she was younger, but not by the time she hit 3-4 months, which make these seem wasteful.Also with the recent stories of children getting positional asphyxia in these from their heads being in too tight of a c-shape, I am not sure they are worth it.I tried the baby bjorn (gift) also when she was small and she loved it, but by around 4 months she wanted to ride forward, and for some reason she did not like riding forward in the bjorn.I also tried and ultimately purchased an Ergo, that was the best fit for baby and me.I did not buy the infant insert or use the ergo until she was about 4-5 months old.I can say she is currently 7 months old and loves her ergo.I know I can't use the sling for her even now, because she will try to "escape" and fall out.She can't get out of the ergo even if something upsets her (tired, fussy, general baby meltdown) and when she does fall asleep her head rests on my chest in an upright position with a nice clear airway (unlike what was happening with some of those slings- although this sling was not specifically cited in the infant sling deaths at the time of this writing)The sling was well made with nice soft fabrics and had a little storage pouch that was big enough for a few dollars or a pacifier to be tucked into it.The material & design is great but I don't know how mothers use this comfortably w/a newborn who is basically flopping around all over w/o any neck support.It was also difficult to transfer my 1 month old out of the sling smoothly and into her crib while keeping her semi-asleep.We have been using these for a few months now.We had no issue with the durability of the spout.The spout on the cup that amazon sells is awful (it's the same nuby no spill cup, same size, same everything - except the valve design).It worked great.The spout was completely inverted when I took it out of my daughters mouth and I has to loosen the top to get it to go back to normal.I tried manually pushing the valve in, no luck.I took the top off and fiddled with the valve in hopes that it was just stuck together because it's new, no luck.Which also came with a handy cover, and these don't.He has always refused a bottle, so we started trying him on a sippy cup around 8 months.I bought the cups with the stoppers that prevent leaks, but he couldn't get the hang of sucking on the cup to drink from it.He didn't have a problem with the cups with two side handles, but this cup is to large for him to easily hold and use at this point.I think that by the time he could hold it that he will have moved on to a more advanced cup.Pros: Dishwasher safeEasy for baby to get the hang ofMostly spill-proofCons: Hard for baby to handle on his own*Update 1/28/11* I think that my son just needed time to get used to the cup.He's now almost 13 months old and can handle it with one hand with no problems.My son isn't too fond of these because the spout is made out of stiff plastic.the cups are cute and easy to clean, but leak.after the child sucks on the spout a few times, the airseal doesn't allow airflow in the cup so the spout starts to invert into the cup.the air vent hole doesn't work properly and i have to continuously pinch the spout or unscrew and screw the lid back on so my daughter can continue to drink from it.the spout is somewhat leaky and messy too.i have to put a bib on her  so prevent a mess on her clothes with this cup.she's not a messy eater/drinker but the spout on this sippy cup just isn't designed well.And the South Shore changing table doesn't wobble.My husband put it together in no time at all.I would recommend this to anyone.We had to replace a hand me down, and we made the right choice.My husband had a daughter that died from SIDS, so I did tons of research and reading before deciding to go with these bumpers vs. the traditional bumpers which may pose a suffocation/rebreathing hazard.I love this crib bumper because it allows me to see/check on my child during the night (his crib is next to our bed)without having to stand over the crib to check, the firm triangle-shaped wedge doesn't cover his breathing, it is super easy to just take out when you change the crib sheet, the foam is odorless/CFC-free, the slipcovers are organic cotton and completely washable, AND his binky no longer falls out onto the floor during the night!It also keeps my son from bumping his head into the wooden slats.I would still absolutely recommend this product to others and still give it five stars!It's made of fabric-covered hard foam, so it doesn't seem like a suffocation risk.IF we didn't have this, we would be pulling out the crib and fishing for pacifiers on the floor in the middle of the night!It also provides just enough of a "wall" so that he doesn't kick his feet through the slats & get them caught.This set is exactly what I wanted.I was hesitant because of the price but when I received it I was completely satisfied as the quality was more than I expected.The only disappointing part was when I looked at the price today...the price went down.I saw this online at Babies "R" Us and fell in love with it (I ended up buying it from [...] for a much cheaper price than BRU).I was hesitant to buy it without seeing it person but decided to take a chance.Each of the animal faces on the comforter and the bumpers are made of different textured fabric which my son loves to stare at and touch.My only complaint would be that the bumper ties are a little too short.old to grow into.He got his teeth in fairly early so I thought he'd get a lot of use from this.All in all, it was a good purchase but not a favorite toy or anything.I was a little upset at first, the product description says "blanket" but its really the size of a wash cloth!!!But my 5 month old loves playing with this teething toy.Our baby was born with a lot of hair.Combine that with the fact that babies spend most of their time lying down, and you've got a recipe for major bedhead!Most baby brushes are adequate - they usually have thin nylon bristles that are reasonably soft enough for use by infants.But I've had trouble finding a decent comb, which I really need to work on the serious tangles and knots that our baby gets.Even the ones with rounded teeth feel very stiff.They just don't feel safe.So I gave this set a try, and it is perfect!I'd love to have extras on hand but not buy the whole set again.The toothbrush bristles are too hard.But the sponge starts to come apart and then tear off completely and then you're left with just the bristles.The reason I went through 4 is because I was sure I was using it too hard, and then I thought I wouldn't use it for the breast pump accessories since they were probably just too much stress on the brush and it wasn't made for those.But even just using it on bottles seems to be too much for the sponge.I think if they would reinforce the materials used to hold the bristles and then make the sponge a much heavier type, it might work.I would recommend these to anyone.I looked because I lost my first pair and you cannot find just the clippers to purchase in stores, only on amazon.From the moment I gave it to him he snuggled it and chewed on it.He can't even nap without it now.I bought this for my baby because she was outgrowing her other polyester sleeping bag.She was already sleeping well, but she stirs less at night in this sleeping bag.I assume it's because she is bothered by temperature changes less.Her other sleeping bag was long sleeve so now I have to make sure she always has something long sleeve on because I'm a bit paranoid about her arms getting cold.It is very well made and soft.Like other people said it had a smell when I got it, but it went away quickly.It sticks great and covers most of the tub.After reading the reviews about the smell of this bath mat I was nervous, but there are not a lot of others to choose from on Amazon or in the stores right now.The price was right so I decided to take a chance, and I am glad I did.Ok, to be fair, there is a smell that did not go away for about 3 days.I started out by placing the bath mat out on the outside porch for a day.It still had that weird plastic-rubber smell to it, which honestly did have me a bit worried.I then put it in the tub and gave my daughter a bath.This mat stuck to the tub really well, and my daughter loved it.I left it in the tub for a week or so, which totally has now cleared up that odd smell totally.My daughter really used to be nervous in the tub because she could feel the slippery floor and also fell one time.She now dances on this mat every time she has bath time and also likes to sit on it and play.I highly recommend this bath mat.Also I should note that this mat is high quality, and I don't have any indication that it will crack or anything like that.We have had this mat now for about 2 months.I bought this mat about 3 months ago.Based on the reviews I thought I would try it.There were comments regarding it not sticking to the tub.It does have "dog toy" quality to it since it's mostly hollow and has a squeaker.We don't have pets but when we visited my sister it quickly became her dog's newest toy.Silver lining - he really enjoys it to this day!It seems to be the right hardness and softness for teething.The 'spikes' are the right length, long enough to reach, but not long enough to gag baby.It also squeaks.Much smaller than expected.Its a teething toy...not much else to say.My little guy plays with it a little (10 months old) but doesnt show anymore interest then the other teething toys.However I LOVE the smell of it...it reminds me of the strawberry shortcake dolls!It's also much cheaper than this one, which reminds me of a dog chew toy.Granted, our daughter is breastfed and does not use the bottle as often as others, but this has gotten some good use over the last 13 months and I love that is entirely plastic free.BPA free or not, I don't want plastic in my daughter's mouth.Here at MommyReview we are big proponents of  green products!We are excited to share Lifefactory Glass  which is BPA/PVC free and non toxic.Not only are you eliminating the exposure of toxins when using this product but it is also made with borosilicate glass.So if you are thinking "Glass, but it might break?"What's thermal shock you ask ?Well if you decided to stick your glass bottle in the freezer straight into boiling water... that's thermal shock.So they have you covered!This bag was for my boyfriend because we decided we each wanted our own diaper bag.Our son is now 10 days old, so the bag is still pretty new to us.Probably the best thing about it is that it really doesn't look like a diaper bag.It just looks like a typical messenger bag that a guy would take to work or something.It has plenty of room for the things we need, and I like the separate zippered compartments on each end for bottles, drinks, etc.I use them to bring a drink for myself.The only negatives I have found are that the velcro is really loud when you want to open the bag, and the changing pad is pretty small.UPDATE: We've now been using this bag for 21 months.Other than that, it's still a great bag.I really love this diaper bag which I initially bought to use as the only diaper bag for us when we go out.It's plenty big enough to fit everything we need for a full day out.I also have to say my husband likes carrying it since it looks just like a regular messenger bag.I do have to say though that I gave up carrying it around for little trips out during the day with my kid.It became too heavy and big for that use in addition to carrying a purse with it so I got a Skip Hop bag/purse to carry for myself when I'm alone and ditched the purse.We use this though on longer outings and when we're together.We've taken it on a very muddy trip and it wiped up really easily with a damp paper towel.They are also very colorful and not too heavy so a baby can play with them even if they are linked together.They are very useful for attaching toys to baby's car seat and hanging on play gyms.I like that you can link them together to get your desired length.I have found these very useful and you get so many.I haven't begun to use them all yet.We have them on V's stroller, jumparoo and car seat!I got a set of these for my first child, and I had my daughter, I got more.Since then, they have added more of the padded multi-colored, soft rings that are better for teething.And it's even better than when I got it almost 2 years ago.I particularly like that you can attach it to the side of a play-pen, a car-seat, I string them across the top of my open-top swing and dangle toys from it,or to attach toys to the tray on the high-chair.They make a great toy by themselves, or great teethers.Or great fasteners.This is an excellent choice for new Mom's anxious to buy baby things or an inexpensive gift for a shower.It's neutral and can be used for several months and not just a few weeks, like other things babies grow out of so fast.Not only is it great quality, soft, thick so you van use it for sleep or to lay down for tummy time, but it is also super cute.I bought the baby cakes one which has cupcakes on one side and fairies on the other simply precious.If you are hesitant don't be you wont be disappointed.Although this blanket is expensive (as are all of the Aden & Anais products) it is worth it.Some complain about "pilling" but I haven't noticed any in 5 months.I will still use it when we absolutely need the clip, but not the rest of the time.I can use them on any shape pacifier and they have prevented them from getting dirty (from falling on the ground).I am glad I got them and recommend them to anyone.I recommend trying this for any other MAM users!We use this whenever we leave the house.The cord is just the right length.I started out putting my 3 month old baby's pacifier on the holder but the loop can also be used to secure smaller toys that clip to either a pocket or the straps of a car seat or high chair.Saves the hassle of constantly picking up the pacifier or toy off the floor.We were so tired of washing my baby's binky all day long!!!!!Thanks for making such a great product!!My almost 2 year old can unstrap, unclip, and remove all the other types of straps not only from her clothes but from the pacifier.This strap stays put on her clothes (as long as I put it somewhere it can grip) and she definitely can't get it off the pacifier.I got the brown and pink striped one just to avoid any possible dot issues so I cannot speak to that but I can say that I am VERY happy with this purchase!It stays attached to my daughters clothes which really saves my patience so I don't have to search when she drops it, not to mention keeping it clean :) I also find that it makes it easier  for me so I don't lose the paci so often considering how small they are and my diaper bag has so much stuff in it.I plan on getting another couple to keep one in the car and one by the crib.I would definitely recommend it.this product can hold different kinds of pacifier but the clip is too tight so it's hard to take it off my baby's shirt when she felt asleep... Plus the price is rather expensive for this tiny holder!i bought another pacifier holder at Walmart for $2.99, it couldn't hold the kind of pacifier I got from hospital (which my daughter loves to such), but all I had to do is attaching a strap to it & it works just like this BooginHead Pacifier Holder (& I saved $1 :) ) (Besides, I don't want to throw away something I just bought, so it's not too bad to add a strap to it)Wish they had more designs though.This paci clip rocks!The Gum Drop pacifiers that we use don't have the standard ring for attaching a holder.This holder solved that problem!I also like the length...long enough so I have options for attaching, but not too long to get tangled.I often hook it on the carseat straps so his pacifier doesn't get lost in the car on road trips.I'm glad it's pretty much universal to all types, because now he likes the regular NUK pacis.The camo print is so cute and it works like it's supposed to!I got this attacher today and was pretty disappointed in it.It's not worth paying even the 5 bucks but then tack on the 5 dollar shipping as well that they charged me and it's definitely not worth the price.Not all that complicated.I would NOT buy this again for myself or a friend.Don't waste you moolah on this one!Best clip on the market, Does not fall off even when pulled vigorouslyIm very happy with my purchase and will be buying more...But my baby doesn't.I requested a couple of the striped ones with the expectation I'd need things to manage the binkies in the house, but my little guy hasn't taken to them and he's nearly 5 months.However, for the handful of times I needed to keep the paci handy, it was nice to have one clipped onto his bouncer or his paci case.It is very true to the picture with pink, teal blue and chocolate stripes.It seems to be well made and arrives in packaging.Because of the loop attachment for the pacifier handle I would think it is suitable for any brand.I have the green and blue striped clip, and I like it a lot.The stripes aren't painted on, but actually woven into the ribbon, so I haven't had any problems with the paint coming off.I have been using my pacifier clips for several months, and I haven't had any problem with the buckle breaking.If your baby uses a binky...this product is a MUST HAVE!!!Saves so much trips to the sink to rinse them!!However, if you buy the pacifier in the picture (which i did), it doesn't have a cover or a box to store it in which is a big minus.It's not recommended to have a pacifier lying around without a cover or box.LOVE this thing!That left use spending a lot of time washing it, which can be especially hard if you're at a public location with limited washrooms.The latch works easily enough, and despite a few negative reviews, seems very well made.If you use a Soothie pacifier, these are the best pacifier holders that I have personally found.The clamp is strong and well made, the fabric is strong and not too long (long = strangulation hazard), and everything is very well sewn.We have 2 of these, the pink polka dot one and the pink striped one.Contrary to another review, the our polka dots are not coming off.I've washed both of ours a couple of times as well (in a mesh bag) and drip dried them.For my crawling baby, this doesn't work so great because the pacifier just drags on the ground as she crawls.It keeps her from loosing it, but it definitely doesn't keep it clean!Aside from using this as a pacifier holder, I also hook them up to rings for my baby to play with in the car!I haven't had any problems with this at all!The bed was very easy to assemble, the drawer caused a bit more trouble.But all in all it only took about 40 minutes to assemble.My daughter was really excited about her new big girl bed and it seems really sturdy.Oh and LOVE the sleigh bed look - so cute in her room!I'm so irritated with this.I have the newer version, and out of the box, it seemed that the battery was dead.I actually had to watch a YouTube video to show me what might be wrong, which was that the timer button had to be pressed in hard with a spoon.I did that and it worked.I put it on my daughter.She thought it was cool, but wouldn't wear it, so I just set it down next to us and set it for 30 minute intervals.It worked fine, and I shut it off that night.I realized it wasn't going off sometime in the afternoon, so I tried resetting it.The lights still went on every 30 minutes, but no sound.What annoys me is that the manufacturer is completely aware of all these problems and continues to sell this product, knowing full well that most of us are going to have wasted our money.It's not our job to pay for his experiment-- we should not be the product testers!All remaining inventory should be scrapped and a better model should be manufactured-- one that won't die or rust out in a matter of days.I like this watch because I don't have to always be the one reminding my daughter to use the potty.Well, never really a hit, but sometimes it seems that the people got it to work for at least a few months and then it either gave out or the kid washed their hands with it on.I really just wanted to use for a week or two to remind my 2 year old with a cute song to sit on the potty every so often until she could recognize the urge herself.So I thought even if it gives out in 2-3 months, I don't mind spending $10-12.I'll save that in pampers or diapers.Alas, I wasn't even that lucky.The thing was a dud on arrival.Never worked.It's too bad because it really is a good idea and doesn't seem to be any others on the market as far as I could tell, but the thing is obviously a problem and the company doesn't seem to mind the en masse returns and complaints.My daughter has one of the singing toilets and she loves it!Anyhow, it's too bad, but don't waste your time...it seems that more often than not the thing doesn't work.Before you are too harsh on this product remember you are only paying about $10-15 for it and that it has no reason to last very long if your child is about ready to be potty trained (i.e.the fact that it rusts out is not the end of the world).But to be clear the quality of this product is truly terrible if you look at it from an adult stand point- and given how cheap decent watches can be it should be made better.!The product does what it says: it goes off at the predetermined time and then automatically resets itself.The main pain is if your toddler is wearing it you have to take it off when s/he washes his hands since it is not even remotely water-resistant.That's how we lost ours ultimately.The other issue is that if you are away from home the music is not particularly loud.If you hang out in libraries or yoga studios it is probably fine but otherwise whether it will be heard is questionable.I ordered these to go over cloth pants just in case.Being concerned about whether your child's bum looks too big is weird, and not putting them in the dryer should be pretty common sense...The seams on every pair split in the wash.  Just on the sides, not everywhere, but it was a waste of money.On top of that my children both hate these with a passion because they are so uncomfortable and noisy.This essentially is a plastic baby for my toddler's bum.It is plastic but leakproof - not quite.The edges don't really hug around enough, so if your kid happens to have an accident, you'll have a nice puddle on your floor.Because there seemed to be very little difference whether my kid wore this or not, I just opted to have him wear the underpants without these waterproof pants - I would have to toss everything in the wash anyways!Another gripe - these pants are HUGE and will make your kid feel hot and uncomfortable.I got these for my daughter, who is smaller than average!These run HUGE and she drowns in them!Wish they could make a smaller size..My daughter hates wearing them and they are cumbersome, but they work very well.Since the only other option is to have accidents on the furniture, or to stop potty training, we're sticking with them.We haven't been using them long, so hopefully she'll get used to them.CARE: Machine wash; hang to dry.They wash up just fine in the sink too.I assume these would work well but my son won't wear them because he doesn't like the feel of them.I like this box, but I think the price is a little bit high for what it is.Despite of this price issue, they serve their purpose, I can put my daughter's toys in it and she even plays with it:-)It has two modes.Single notes or a song for each note pressed.You switch the modes on one of the antennas.Sound and volume is great and I have not changed the batteries once yet in the past year.The only thing wrong is the velcro part to roll it up.The hem gets undone sooner or later.So I dont roll it up.But other than that it is a great toy.My girls choose this over the regular ball they have.None of my children or any I have ever seen play with one of these has ever gotten hurt in any way by this ball.I would recommend this for sure.I read the description of this ball and I had to order it.The sensory part of the ball is really annoying to me, it's all spiky and hard, I don't know how they have the picture of a baby in it, I wouldn't give this to a baby ever.My toddler of 17mons old, doesn't play with it much even though he loves balls, I don't think he likes the texture either.So all I got was an overpriced spiky ball that is right now sitting on a corner of his room.My point of view is that it actually looks like a nice necklace and it holds up to wear.I dont see how you can go wrong.My daughter loves this toy.It's still fine with the lights, sounds, and complication of a lot of toys out today.My 8 weeks old son is a full time breast feeder and we have spent well over $60 trying EVERY Binky that the stores have to offer.He hates it.I think the nipple is the main problem.Given that this has to be replaced after a month and is expensive, I would not recommend it if you already have found something that works.He hates them... but I love that they are made of all-natural sources.I purchased every type of paci known to man.She refused the NUK and all others.She takes it, and that's all that matters.I need to buy 100 of them.Love this binky for so many reasons.I hope to outline them here and dispel a few myths some people posted.The reason?Check it out yourself.As a mom of three boys with allergies I know how important it is.My youngest is five months and just a seizure like episode (we think do to allergies, all mine have allergies of some sort).You've either boiled it too long or let it sit in water.You can't let these soak in a soapy water bowl like you would for your bottles.You can't put them in the dishwasher even on santize.Bring water to a boil in a stainless steel pan.Set timer for two minutes on the stove, drop binky in, and start your timer.Two minutes are up set them on a clean dishtowel.This is what my mom showed me with my first.He's just a bit cranky in the mornings and evenings before his naps.And, I actually could take the older kids out by myself without a cranky baby!!Wish I would have found them with my first...these are the best binkies I've had.While they all took them when they had to it saves me to have my youngest actually like to take a binky.He is a breastfed baby and would gag every time I put this in his mouth.He likes other pacis...but LOVES this one.It's also a little larger, so it's easier for him to put it back in his mouth after dropping (he's 5 months old).I searched everywhere locally for a one-piece, non-latex, and BPA-free binky.I finally decided to look online, and ordered these for my daughter.I buy them as gifts and recommend them to everyone I know.After the birth of my last child my Ergo just barely fit and not comfortably.The extender belt worked perfectly and had gave me room to adjust the fit better.I've lost weight but still use this because I can more easily buckle this in the center of my back than on the side where the original clip is.I had ordered it because I am not on the small side but when I received my Ergo, it fit me with room to spare so I returned this extender but it is really well made and it does what it is supposed to.Great idea!I can take these to work, and I don't have to worry about rinsing off the toothbrush or the toothpaste residue.You can hear it squeak when you rub your teeth, so you know it's really cleaning.I love that the lid is interchangeable with the soothie bottles.But I don't fault it really.My daughter does throw it around and shake it.She has actually drank a little out of it.She's almost 11 months old and still prefers the bottle over anything else.99% spillproof.This is such a simple, yet versatile toy.This toy has been used to practice stacking and unstacking, to knock over towers, to put things in, and with the upcoming developmental milestones I am sure it will be put to other great uses.An absolute favorite and it is looked for during each play time.I would purchase this toy over and over again.So much to do and to learn for many years to come.this car seat is great!both my boys grew out of my 22 lbs weight limit infant carrier seat at 7 months and i needed something convertible to pu tthem in, and i wanted it to last.it is easy to install no matter how you are using it, rear, forward, latch, or belt.My daughter is clearly very comfortable in it and recently slept about 10 hours of a 14-hour car trip in this seat!A call to the Britax customer service worked wonders--she explained a trick to try and we got the hang of it, but it is much easier to pull the harness tight now that we have the seat forward facing.Another tip for anyone else with a CR-V or similar-sized car:  when it was rear-racing, this seat worked fine with the two center LATCH connectors but when you turn the seat foward facing, the footprint of the seat is much wider and we found it impossible to get it snug using the two center LATCH bars.Doesn't move at all--the tether almost seems gratuitous but of course we use that too!And I do really like the height adjustment knobs, very handy for Little Miss Growing Like a Weed.In warm weather with tank tops, etc, the shoulder straps do come into contact with bare skin and I'm really glad I can adjust the pads to cushion her neck/shoulders.Although it is so big, traveling with it is kind of a pain.After lots of research, I decided on this Boulevard car seat.It was, but fit in my Santa Fe easily.We got this for a drive cross country when my daughter was not yet 1 but growing out of her infant carrier, she was very comfortable riding facing backwards as she was high enough to be able to look out the window.Now, facing forward, she also sits high and enjoys the same.I think it would really be nice if the seat cover was able to be removed for cleaning purposes.I bought the Madison print for quite a discount since it was not being made anymore and might not be willing to spend the full price.Doesn't sit as high as the Britax, but she still seems to like it.Bottom line, Britax is a great product, but if the price is stopping you, I recommend the Nautilus.Very disappointed with the product, It actually had some good reviews so I was very excited to buy it and hopefully make bath time more fun (by keeping the water out of my child's face) and unfortunately this product does not do that.My 3 year old daughter had gotten to the point where we could barely wash her hair without a screaming knock-down drag-out fight.Bath time became miserable and ended in a sobbing, upset child each night.We found the Lil Rinser and immediately started showing her the pictures and videos of other kids using it.She was very excited to try it out the first time.I was very careful when introducing the product and made sure to use it properly.I think the product does have limitations.For younger kids it might be difficult for them to understand how the product is going to work or help them.My child also has a small head and I found that I had to pay careful attention to get a proper seal to avoid leaks.Finally, it does leave a bit of a soap ring where the product was placed.I find a bit of extra rinsing by hand after the product is removed remedies the problem.We have probably been using it for 6 months or more, and it gets easier and easier every time.Good luck if you think that you could use this device with only one person.Just remember that it gets easier and easier each time you use it on your baby, as they become more accustomed to it.I refused to purchase this for several months because it looks ridiculous.We finally broke down and purchased it.Our son has a normal shaped/sized head but this thing still let water leak through.It also annoyed him to have it on or near his head.Seems to be one of the those things that works for some babies but not for most.This fits my 20 month old daughte AND it fits me, so no worries as to whether this will fit your child.My son was about a year and a half old when I broke down and bought this product.Washing his hair was a horrible ordeal every time.It was something I just tried to rush through.This product is GREAT though!At first, he didn't quite believe me, but once I got it on and got his hair wet, he was thrilled!You do have to be careful to have the child lean back and push the splash-guard back to drain the water out.If you pull it straight off, the water that's sitting inside will fall into the child's face.I know this is long, but I really wanted to highlight this stroller and some of the features we didn't even know about until after we got it.We purchased this stroller after a few weeks of research.My husband was sure he wouldn't like it, but after putting our 11 month old daughter in it for a test drive as well as messing with many of the other strollers there, we left the store with a Brownie Kooper and are extremely satisfied.Including the husband.So here are the pros and cons of what we consider a spectacular find.If you want quick why we love it just shoot to the end!Pros:LIGHT weight and folds very compact.We had it with us when we purchased the Kooper and so we had almost no room back there.So we put the Kooper in the backseat and it fit in between our 7 yo daughter and our 11 month old in her huge car seat.Comfy with baby in mind.I can't stand umbrella strollers on average because of how kids have to sit in them.Not a problem here.The shoulder straps have padding around them and one benefit we found not listed on their site or obvious in photos is that the buckles swivel, so you don't have to struggle to keep the straps straight with a squirmy baby.It is also amazingly roomy because of how the bars arc around the child.They are smaller at the foot and the handles and wide in the middle, like those arc rod shower curtains.Buckling the kid in is also a snap.As in snap snap done.Yet I can still tell you the babies can't undo it.Very secure.One handed recline with no pre-defined height settings.Put it where you want it.Maneuverability is a breeze.My husband can't keep up with me in store aisles as it turns on a dime and fits everywhere you do.You can easily push and turn the Kooper with one hand.The bottom bars are high enough off the ground and far enough underneath the stroller that my 6 foot husband could not kick the axles even when he tried during our two hour around the store testing session.They also support the bottom of the basket so it can support more weight.(The basket is also removable for cleaning!)The padded handles are very comfortable and at a good height for both of us (I'm 5'5" and he is 6')The hood.OMG the hood.The top of the baby's back rest has a strip of Velcro that will then attach to the BOTTOM of the part the drinks hang on, and you have a foot more shade!Mind you, I would not leave anything in the cup holders at this time :DBrakes work great, are easy to do and enough of a challenge to undo I don't worry about an accidental break release yet still simple enough to not annoy you.Collapsing and setting up are also speedy fast and well done designed.The Kooper does have a latch to hold it closed when folded.There are reflectors on the hood, the shoulder straps, the side and the labels.The bottle holders are very handy as well though I would recommend getting an add on parent tray for open type cups.We mostly keep sunscreen bottles in them.For a lightweight stroller, this is superb.Cons:The handles are not height adjustable, this has never been a big deal for me but I know some people need it.They do not recommend use until 6 months, so it IS technically a replacement or second stroller.It is not car seat compatible either.The Kooper does not come with parent or child snack trays but you can easily buy affordable add ons to fix this.It seems to be a negative for most "Umbrella classified" strollers due to the way they fold- we have to remove the add on one before we collapse the Joovy since it gets so compact.The cup holders are more closed bottle holders- I recommend getting an add on parent tray (Like the sunshine kids one).We use them to store our sunscreen bottles for us and the kids.There is no bumper/safety bar if you look for that.Once again, there are add ons (such as the belly bar) but add ons do add cost to the overall price of the stroller.Looking from the front the whole thing is just nice curves and well thought out.Aluminum, high strength easy clean attractive fabric, and all the little touches (like the mesh pouches for kids, reflectors, swivel snaps, movable canopy and zip compartment) really add up to great value.Sanp the wheels on and attach the canopy and go.I can pick up the entire stroller with one hand and also manuver it one handed.It handles amazing and it really narrow in the front for those hard to get through ailes.The seat reclines almost completely flat and definetly accomodates a baby younger then 6 months.It has very plush fabrics and amazingly, lumbar support LOL.I need that more then the baby.The price for this stroller is great - I would have expected to have paid at least $100 more due to the quality.I only have 3 issues, but they are not enough for me to get a different stroller.I do not like that there is not a snack/belly bar for the baby, and they do not apprear to make one after market.The basket underneath is really flimsy and just rests on the support bars, it doesn't really hold up well, wish it was more ridgid.Also when folded it does not stand on its own, draw back when trying to juggle baby on the hip and get it in and out of the trunk.All in all this is my 4th baby and probably my 20th stroller and this is hands down my favorite!I'd received a basic Graco as a shower gift which was very helpful when I could attach my infant car seat.As baby has grown, however, and walks have ranged farther, I found my old stroller to be cumbersome on streets and hard to maneuver in stores.I am on a budget and don't have a garage, so a larger jogger was out of my means and too big for my home.I love the color, too (yellow) - helps to make my baby very visible in this day of cell phone-using drivers.I did purchase additional storage - one that stretched across the handle bars to hold beverages, since the wee ones on the stroller hold only cans or the smallest water bottles.I also got 2 side panniers for added storage.Very good stroller and looks cute, as well.There are better ones, but they are much pricier.This is a good value.I checked out joovy kooper at local babiesrus store and read many reviews.Here are some pros and cons of the joovy.Pros:  excellent canopy, your baby can nap in it.A must for my son..very very sturdy frameparent cup holder on the back of the canopyeasy to pushadjustable backrestCons:(the reason I did not purchase this stroller)There is no auto-locking mechanism when you fold the stroller.It's an umbrella fold, and when it's folded, you have to manually latch the unit together.This means, this stroller won't be so great for travel(in and out of car and airport security checks).You would be fumbling with the manual latch on the floor of the airport.The fold is similar to the joovy.The zooper twist has auto-lock mechanism but still is hard to travel with because the umbrella fold does not stand on it's on when folded.So I can't imagine having to deal with a manual lock.So, joovy kooper, please just add a auto-lock to make this stroller easier to travel with.Also, the foot rest is not adjustable to allow baby to lay flat.I hate this stroller.I can't push it with one hand and it gets hung up on everything.Forget taking it to a fair where there might be grass or gravel--I get mad just taking the thing around the block.It feels flimsy to me, too.I can't wait to throw it out.And the color is awful.Forget "brownie" or "chocolate" or whatever.It looks like shiny dog poop.I just recieved the stroler.unfold even easier(2 steps, 3 if it was fastend).both fold and unfold is posible with my baby on the arm, you will have to squat down to take hold of the handle's to unfold though...still possible.the break is ok.I had to realy step on it( holding the stroller with both hands, otherwise it will just roll away)but it works, and release is also ok... still bare feet!You can push the stroler with one hand...even if the frontweals are in swifelmode and with the baby in...( I did tried it in the house though...The stroller is 55 cm wide, 80cm long( frontweels to handle) and the handles are 100cm above the ground.for me, 1.63m tall a perfect hight, my elbows are about 100degree flexed.the basket is a good size30cm wide, 40cm long, in the front 10 cm high, in the back 17 cm high, there is good acces from the back and sides, the material of the basket seems thin but reasonably strong..but time will tell and there is extra support beneath the basket with 2 metal bars that cross.the sippered pouch is  20cm wide,15cm high and 3-4cm thick.the cupholders(fabric) hold bottels or closed cups and is 12cm high and has a diameter of 7.5cm( a gatorate bottle fits snugly)up till now my only concern is that the sholderstraps are at the shortest possible set, but still aren't thight enough for my babygirl.I am used to the carseat restrains...An other thing..not really a minus.. is that she tilts to one side.Because the seat is so roomy, and she is still small it is a bit more difficult for her to sit up straight when the seat is all the way up.The obvious things like canopy etc...need no extra mentioning.I was going back and fort between the kooper and the baby jogger city mini...:the kooper has a very good backsupport, is more stable in design(weight distribution over the weelplatform), has some extra's(cupholders etc) and the fold of the kooper is easy enough compared to the 1step fold of the city mini, and it's half the price.So I am glad with my buy.I use the stroller almost everydag to walk in the park, on a brickstreet.It goes well on grass, but does't go on sand.I took off a star because I find that the frontweels are indeed giving me problems.if you turn, it's hard to get them to go straight again....if i had known it would be like this i would probably have searched furter.other then that...it works good, my child likes it, and it's handy.I prefer a different placement for the brakes.Living in NYC we'll have to make lifestyle and travel plan adjustments because of that like wearing my son in the Ergo and carrying the stroller on the subway, or only going to stops with elevators.He won't tolerate the flimsy soft sling seats of the Peg Perego Aria or the Maclarens as they aren't supportive; he hates sitting low and slumpy like that.My normally always cheerful guy would fuss after a short while in those seats.We do not find the height of the handles a problem in fact I find it very comfortable.The handles are great; our old stroller with a bar handle started giving me pain in my hands and wrists but this stroller doesn't aggravate my hands at all.The way this stroller is designed you can hang a heavy diaper bag or purse on its handles and it won't tip over even when the child gets out of the stroller.I hang heavy groceries on the handle too sometimes and it takes the weight fine.The way the stroller is designed that way it can stick on particularly large bumps in the sidewalk not roll right over them, but if I had to choose between sometimes having to deal with that or having the stroller tip backwards easily I choose the former.I was really disappointed after using the stroller the past month.It's not worth the price tag.Reasons why the stroller was returned:* TERRIBLE FOR TALL PEOPLEFirst, the stroller handles are NOT tall.I also found myself hunched over while pushing.My son's grandfather, who is barely 6 foot, would kick the stroller when walking.The wheel that wouldn't turn would almost collapse under the stroller as you pushed, causing the frame to bend.This wouldn't be a problem if there was a chest clip, which could keep the straps up and stop little Houdinis from escaping.But it doesn't really clip in all that well, so every time I opened the stroller I had to snap it back in on the side.It's a great idea, but poorly executed.*NOT QUITE COMPACTThe stroller isn't as small as an umbrella stroller when you collapse it.I knew from looking at a video on YouTube, so it didn't surprise me.The stroller does not lay flat, because of the front wheels.*IMPOSSIBLE STRAP TO LOCK/OPENI hate the plastic strap that you use to "lock" it.Basically you push the head of a screw through a plastic strap with a hole on one side (the other side is secured to the bar of the stroller) in order to keep the stroller in a closed position.I have to push the stroller together so that the strap is loose, then I have to fiddle with it to get the screw head out.Except that didn't mean much to me when I'd be struggling to push the thing in the mall (we are talking totally flat, even ground here).The cup holders are okay.This was a neat feature.There is a zipper pouch, cool place to tuck a digital camera or phone.I tried it for a month, the first few uses were fantastic, but the wheels actually show a lot of wear (and we didn't use this stroller that often) and the front wheel kept sticking on me (I tried locking and unlocking it to solve the problem, but it didn't).I really wanted this stroller to work for me and I'm so disappointed it didn't.My son is only a year old, so he can't come out and tell me what he thinks of the Joovy Kooper, but he would cry all the time when I had him in it.He would mess with the canopy all the time, and since it didn't lock into place properly on the side, he'd pull it out.I gave the stroller one star because even at the steep discount price I paid, it wasn't dependable and the ease of use was non-existant.----------------------------UPDATE:I went back to the drawing board and narrowed down my top two replacement choices to theZooper Twist Stroller, Coconut Waves(which for almost the same price as the Joovy comes with a foot muff, mosquito net and rain cover) and MacLaren(I was wishy washey about whether to go low-end or high-end).I happened to stop in to a discount store and found aMaclaren Volo Stroller, Pea Green and Black Stripefor LESS THAN HALF the price of the Joovy (and less than listed here).It weighs in at about 8 pounds and while I thought the Joovy was light (compared to my Gracco Quattro) ...this thing is DIVINE.I can fold it in one hand (using a pull strap) and then you can carry it over your shoulder with the strap!Best of all, my son doesn't seem to mind sitting in it, and he even sits back!I was in the market for an extra stroller that was similar to the Chicco Cortina Travel System that I had been using, but without the weight and bulk.I love how it glides when you push it!you can even undo the velcro at the top to pull it all the way forward if you are walking into the sun and it's still hitting their face.Although the seat doesn't recline all the way flat, I found it to be very comfortable for my daughter to take a nap in.I also really like the yellow.(like a golden yellow, not overly bright) Very cute!Obviously, this is a little bigger than your typical umbrella stroller.Not huge, but enough room for the essentials.the only cons were that I wish there was a bar or tray to put snacks on, but there are plenty of after market add-ons that offer good options.the handles don't telescope out, but that hasn't become a problem between me or my husband.(he's 6') Also the latch to close the stroller was a little too small and was difficult to snap on.its a bendable plastic latch, so I used a knife to open the hole a little more to make it easier to latch.Otherwise definitely worth it!This isn't like the traditional "boring" mobiles that just turn and play music.There is a plastic turtle and lady bug on a squiggly track inside that jiggle their way down as the mobile turns.There are stars and other shapes on the outside ring of the mobile that also fall.The first night we had it in my daughter's crib she stayed up (quietly) in her crib for an extra hour just watching the mobile.The music has two volume settings, and you can turn off the blue light at the top of the mobile, but not the green frog at the bottom of the mobile.This comes with a remote!The only cons about the remote is that it only turns the mobile on and off, it doesn't change the tune, the volume, or any other settings.The music lasts a really long time so you don't have to turn it back on every few minutes.I've gotten so used to the music that I sleep through it now even on high volume.This is really great as I found my daughter with her little hands wrapped around the pink flamingo's legs (which I just love that there's a pink flamingo and a hippo in the first place).Yes, this mobile was expensive, but I've had it for several months and we've never changed the batteries or had any issues with, we use it every single night, and for naps as well.I plan on using this for any other children I have in the future.I hunted around and finally came across this jem!This has everything for a hard to please baby.By far my favorite!The set up to attach this to the crib is for a smaller standard crib.It was worth the work to figure it out though!I would not recommend it for night time though.The blue light is strong and the sound of the ladybugs of the zigzag is distracting.My baby has fell asleep with this mobile a few times but sometimes the zigzag noise wakes her up.The awful awful thing about this mobile is: BATTERY LIFE...I probably used it with lights 20 times and by that time, the light didn't turn on again, and it started playing the music a bit slower and the movement was slow as well, I thought it may be a defect and was thinking of returning it but, I changed the batteries and surprise it worked again.So please...Tiny Love company: IMPROVE BATTERY LIFE it is so very dissapointing.I would not buy another Tiny Love product knowing this issue.He loves this thing, and I do too!I was thinking that it might look a little less like a necklace than an actual teething ring that just happens to be on a black cord.I plan to order a couple more in different colors!EVERY mom with an infant should have one of these.Nothing better to occupy your baby while shopping, in church, eating out - you name it.All kids want to play with their mom's necklace.Unless you're up close, it looks like a stone.It's not for forever - now that she's over a year old, she's not so worried about chewing on stuff, but it was worth the money for the time I used it.I just wish I had discovered them earlier!I'll definitely buy more if I have another child.My 4 month old baby likes to put everything in her mouth - her fingers, my fingers, my hair, my clothing and especially my jewelry.I had to stop wearing necklaces, but then I ordered this pendant.It's not exactly "nice" jewelry, but it's cute with a casual outfit and it serves it's purpose: to keep my good jewelry out of my baby's mouth!I ordered this pendant while it was on sale ($10).I have been through a lot of bottles looking for something baby and I both like using.They are really cute too, which is also a plus.you can hear the air going out the bottom vents, so I know that it is helping him swallow less air.He has a lot of gassiness already, so finding a good bottle like this was a challenge.So glad to finally have these!My daughter seemed to like the MAM pacifier so I bought this product.There are too many parts to clean and too much of a margin for error when using these as it is easy to screw them together skewed, resulting in leakage.Also, heating up the milk by putting the bottle in a cup of hot water does not work as the milk escapes out the bottom holes.Baby doesn't seem to have an issue with the nipple, although she's not picky and will drink from any.However, it has leaked several times thru the bottom part.We switched to NUK bottles, MUCH better....My daughter is six weeks old and I've only had to put the refill in once.And even though the diapers are in there for so long there is no smell in the nursery.You'd never know we had dirty diapers in there.We had the diaper champ with our son and stopped using after only a few weeks as that diaper pail didn't contain the smell.When the movers broke our regular Diaper Genii II we replaced it with your Diaper Genii II Elite.We figured that as good as the regular product was, the "Elite" version had to be better.We were wrong.Every time you open it to drop in another diaper the smell is unbearable.Since we had been using the original product we have a basis for comparison and know the newer model is much, much worse.It is nice to be able to step on a pedal and drop in a soiled diaper.However, that convenience does not outweigh the problems of odor control.I was debating between this and theBaby Trend Diaper Champ in Pinkand picked this mostly because it was on sale at the time.Yes, it's basically a plastic trash can, but it does a great job of containing baby stink!I like that the diapers, wipes, etc are all contained within the plastic bag and I never have to clean the container itself...unlike the Diaper Champ I used at a friend's, when the diaper smeared all over the plunger part and I had to use a dozen wipes to get it cleaned up.Yuck!I can generally go a full week without emptying the Genie, which takes all of twenty seconds - open the top half, cut, tie a knot on the full bag, remove full bag, tie a knot on the empty bag, pull a little extra through the "jaws" and close the top half.I did throw one of myMunchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Packin the bottom of the Genie but that was more because I like the lavender scent than because there was odor to cover up.The refills generally last 3-4 weeks for us and it's easy to tell when you're almost out, since there's a big black line on the plastic bag.If given a mulligan, I would buy this again.EDIT 8/28/12: Over two years later and our Diaper Genie still gets the job done with no issues!We like this product that it keeps the smell away.Once you open the canister to empty out you can really smell the smell.I'm wondering if the Armor product would be better or is it just hype as well.But for $35 buck you can't go wrong.It is definitely better than putting diapers straight into the garbage and it is pretty easy to use.I am a first time mom of twins and my friend had told me this is a must have.IT is super easy to assemble and switching the bag refills is a breeze.I like the hands free opening top cause you do not want to be juggling stinky diapers.It blocks out ALL odor (and my son can create some stinkers!).Tie a knot at the end of the refill bag, push it to the bottom of the pail and you're done.You can't let it fill completely to the top, however, or you can't cut off the bag very easily.This holds a LOT of diapers before needing to be changed.I have no issues with smell (and my little one puts out some stinkers!).The foot pedal is great when you are up to your elbows in baby poo!I tend to wait until the last possible moment to take out the dirty diapers, so I have to pack them in when it gets full.I end up with a four foot long tube of dirty diapers, yuck!It is a little difficult to take out without putting it into another trash bag first.I haven't smelled one single stinky diaper.Diaper disposal is easy - step on the foot pedal, the top opens,drop in the diaper and release the foot pedal.When you step on the foot pedal again, it disappears.The clever trap door system inside never allows the old diaper smells to come out when you open the top.Bag replacement is convenient and odorless.For the fact that it works considerably well it is worth the money.We also own a Diaper Champ... luckily it was free, cause the smell is disgusting.Honestly, the Champ is hopeless.My baby is 5 weeks old and we have been using this since we brought our baby home and it holds quite alot of diapers and doesn't smell at all.His diapers have truly tested the limits of this product and it still works great.I have only had to buy 2 boxes of refills so far which is not bad either.After having the worst experience dealing with keeping the odors contained with theBaby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, BlueI was worried this would be another repeat and another $30 or so down the drain.I'm happy to report as of 3 weeks in, this has been a significant improvement.I'm also very please I purchased this one over thePlaytex 40002 Diaper Genie II Systembecause pushing the diaper through instead of opening it with your foot was very unpleasant.The only design flaw with this product is a pretty bad flaw...I've got a handful of spots on my hand where I've skinned myself while doing this.It hurts like hell and I get bleeding wounds from it.My son is currently 4 months old, and he is a frequent eater (breastfeeds every 1-2 hours) who takes very few daytime naps.He also wants to be held constantly and cries if laid down or left alone too long.The Sleepy Wrap is the only way I can get him to nap longer than 30 minutes during the day!He will often sleep for 2-3 hours in the wrap, waking for a snack and then back off to sleep.I'm a full-time student taking classes online, and I can study and surf the internet with baby wrapped against me!It's the only way I can get things done during the day.If you are a fan of Attachment Parenting, this product is perfect.I also use the Wrap when going out and about.I simply put the wrap on at home, then transfer him into the wrap from the car seat and carry him with me in stores, at the mall, etc.A much better alternative than carrying a carseat, lugging along a stroller, or finding a shopping cart to place the carseat into.The Wrap is extremely comfortable when standing or walking, and I have no problems with back or neck pain while carrying my son, who is currently 15 lbs.My son was developing a flat spot on his head, and one of the ways I helped treat this was by keeping him in the Wrap.The website says no repositioning is required, but I find that I do have to reposition my son, from side to side and sometimes further down my chest, in order to feed him.It is not a completely discreet way to feed, so I use my Jelly Bean nursing cover over it.If you have a fussy or needy baby, I highly recommend getting this wrap.I wanted to LOVE this.I loved the idea of it anyway.It is a little bit of a pain to put on because the piece of fabric is very long.I find myself carrying Zoe around more than I do putting her in the wrap.I did go to flea market determined to wear Zoe in the wrap and had to put the wrap on at home before I got in the car, because I didn't want to fumble around with it in the parking lot, dragging the looooong fabric all over.Had another baby and this time am out a lot more due to having a toddler who would not like sit at home all day.I have already used my wrap 5 times and baby is not quite 2 months.I'm giving this more stars.It also IS NOT HARD TO FIGURE OUT once you play with it for a few minutes.Basically I handed it to my Hubby who took 10 minutes and then came and showed me how it works.I use it all day around the house when he's being fussy.I placed this on my registry because of the great reviews and because I felt like I needed some type of infant carrier or sling that would hold my daughter since she is so small.The conventional slings like Baby Bjorn or similar ones are too big for her right now.While this wrap holds my 7 week old securely, it takes some real skill to get this thing on in a way that your baby will fit in it securely and not sag or slide out.Still, I have mixed feelings about this cloth contraption.I feel like it is way overpriced for what it is (again a very long piece of stretchy nylon type cloth that wraps around you several times), it takes at least 2 people to adjust the wrap properly AND place your child in it, and it is definitely not for summer months unless you live in Alaska or Canada.I live in Virginia and even in 75 degree weather, this wrap makes my 7 week old daughter sweat a lot and that is just with a diaper and nothing else on!I've used it maybe 3 times and only 1 time outside of the house.It also looks really strange on in person (lol).Just my opinion...They both seem to be the exact same concept and you can do all the same holds with them but I will be keeping the Sleepy Wrap because the fabric has more give and stretch to it which makes it easier for me to tuck the baby inside and then adjust it to support her head.At first I wasn't sure if I would like the wrap style carrier because all the fabric seemed cumbersome but after a few tries I learned how to do it and I can get it on within a few seconds.I prefer the wrap over my traditional front carrier because it is much easier on my back and because it provides newborn head support so you really can have your hands free.I have to add that of all the baby gear we've bought this is by far the best investment (and ironically the least expensive) because it soothes like nothing else.When the fabric was pulled to it's full width it would cover my back and shoulders, so I could carry the baby in just a diaper right against my skin while we were both covered, and yet have my hands free to get things done around the house.I used this method a lot in those early weeks and felt it was very beneficial.Around 8 months I found that I wanted a carrier with more structure that I could easily click on and off and I graduated to an Ergo Baby carrier (which I've also reviewed on Amazon and cannot recommend highly enough).I bought this to replace an inflatable cover that turned out to be useless (because the valve wouldn't close and it wouldn't hold air for even a single use).It slides on and off easily, it's cute (and I'm not even a big Elmo fan), the baby likes to reach up and touch Elmo, and I feel it provides nice protection from the possibility of the tub spout hurting my baby's head should he make a fast move.I love this spoon, but we only used it for a month or two.My daughter wasn't interested in being spoon fed and wanted to feed herself, so after a month or two using this we put it away and focused more on finger foods and only occasionally use it for yogurt or oatmeal.Two problems:-It obviously only works for pureed foods.I imagine this isn't an issue if you're using jarred food, but if you are making your own food it's something to keep in mind.That said, I love the design, it's obviously of very high quality, it helps keep mealtimes much cleaner and easier, and it's very cute.Also, unlike the regular spoons my daughter did not try to grab this one, presumably because it was too big for her to grab.So consider how long you'll actually use it before buying.It is a tiny hole.If you plan on only feeding finely pureed mush to your baby for several months on end, this might work.Really tho, the hole is so small that getting even mush through it smoothly enough so that it flows into the spoon instead of shooting out of it at high velocity.In other words...It's a yuppy toy that doesn't quite hit the mark when it comes to taking a good concept and fleshing it out into a usable product.When the Boon Spoon first came in the mail I thought "It's huge!"and wasn't what I was expecting for travel.We loaded an entire gerber baby food container into it and it slowly squeezes out.Our baby ate like a champ and this was really convenient.We recapped what she didn't finish for later.We particularly liked that we didn't have to worry about her grabbing at the food container, putting her hands in it or it tipping over constantly.We will be ordering another!UPDATE:  If you use the pouch foods with a screw-off top (i.e.Plum Organics, Revolution Foods, HappyBaby, Ella) - also check outPlum Organics Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)- much simpler clean-up, comes with two spoons and a case, and you can save what isn't eaten for 24-48 hours.This spoon is a great idea - it's easier than bringing a jar and spoon with you when you're out and about.However, I have two issues with this product:*  One, the spoon "cover" only covers the top half of the spoon (and is often hard to snap on when you've got your hands full) - the underside of the spoon is exposed.So, I have to wrap the spoon in a paper towel or stick the whole piece in a sandwich baggie so that the spoon doesn't get contaminated when in the diaper bag.This seems like such a simple thing, I don't understand why they wouldn't have made a full cap from the beginning.When you squeeze the bulb for more food, it naturally sucks back in so - wouldn't you think that any food left on the spoon after it's been in baby's mouth (and there is quite a bit) would have the possibility of being sucked back into the holding bulb?If you're going to use it for a one time feeding while out, then sure it's a decent product.But, that's me.I'm giving it three stars because of the two issues above.It's so easy and convenient.When I used to feed her with a regular spoon & bowl, she would cry because I'm not scooping the food for her quick enough!I would recommend it to everyone I know.My daughter liked it the first time we let her play with it in the tub.After that, she seems disinterested.So, it doesn't hold her attention.We have been using these bottles on and off for about 5 months, and daily for a few weeks.We have yet to have a leak.I'm not sure if Avent has updated them recently, or if it's user error causing the leaks, but all has been well here.My only leaks are when I use the clear bottles and forget the ring, and that's not this product.I am buying more of these honey bottles without the rings because they are so much easier to use, no worrying about forgetting a part.I don't do anything special to use them.I just pull the nipple firmly through the white ring, ensuring it's all the way flush, and then screw the lid on.We have found that the formula heats up more quickly if the bottle is open, so we don't put the lid on until after it's warm.I definitely recommend these bottles.I just hope they don't start leaking and prove me wrong!here's a story: I had just gotten my baby out of the bathtub and was giving him his goodnight bottle, when I noticed some formula dripping on my arm.I looked and formula had been dripping onto my baby's shirt, down his neck to my arm and all over his hair that I just washed (and he does not like his hair washed).And it was all over my shirt and pants.Does that sound like something you want to happen to you?Try another brand.I wish I had read the reviews first!Honestly, for how expensive these bottles are I am EXTREMELY disappointed.But they leak.Every Avent bottle we have used has leaked.Not just the hard, yellow ones, but the clear ones that come with the blue ring as well.However, it seems that the more the bottle and nipple are used, the more likely they are to leak, and since babies can eat anywhere from 6-10 times a day...they start leaking pretty quickly.Everyone I know has had the same problem.However, if you want to keep replacing the nipple every few weeks, that's up to you.And there is a trick, supposedly, to "fix" the leaking.What you do is when you put the nipple in the ring, you line up the vents in the nipple so they are blocked by the white things where you screw on the bottle.This only worked for maybe one feeding and after that never worked again.Don't buy these.We've never had problems with leaks, even with the older design bottles.We've tried a few brands and these are by far our favorite.They are easy to use and are not a pain to clean.Avent was the first nipple we tried and he took it.When I first put the bottle together it did leak.I re-pulled the nipple through the collar and then tightened - really tightened and no more leaks!Despite the massive amounts of negative reviews, I began purchasing these bottles while I still pregnant.I have all three sizes and I use them with my Avent Isis pump and also put formula in them.Any leaking I encountered was user error.I have found that washing in the dishwasher causes slight warping, so I wash by hand in the sink.I like that they are BPA free and the nipples are silicone.The nipples are also the most breast-like I have encountered.Avent parts are also interchangeable, so I can use the spouts and handles for the sippy cups with my bottles and use the sippy cups for a bottle if I need to.Tighten it just enough to secure it.It won't leak....promise!I do this several times before i get it right.I honestly don't recommend them at all.I bought Medela bottles after i tried the ones that came with breast pump and they are of very good quality.Buy anything but Avent bottles in general.Great for babies with colic/reflux.However, beware of Amazon's packaging.I received three boxes of these bottles with packaging that is different from the packaging in stores.My bottles came looking worn and scratched.These bottles are infuriating!I used Avent bottles and products with my first three children and never had a complaint.In fact, I used to recommend them to all of my friends.However, with all the hype about BPA, we decided to get rid of our old Avent plastic bottles and purchase the "new and improved" non-BPA ones.BIG MISTAKE!Something is really wrong with the venting system in these new bottles.They leak constantly all over everything and make a huge mess.Sometimes, I'll get the lid on correctly and it won't leak, but then it's impossible to figure out what I did to get it on right.There seams to be some sort of silicone flap on the underside of the nipple.We haven't had any leak issues with these, and that makes for peaceful midnight feedings with the babies.Avent needs to go back to the drawing board.I still love their formula caddy and bottle warmer, though!It's a good bottle but it leaks sometimes.When I have my next baby I probably won't choose this baby bottle again.I am writing this review out of sheer frustration!I want to warn other moms and dads out there about these ridiculous bottles!A friend of mine is a nurse and recommended these Avent bottles to use.There are as many good reviews as there are poor ones.Now to give them credit they did help with my sons gas problem, they are very durable and wash easy, and Avent makes lots of other nice products for babies.But I soooo wish I didn't waste all that money on these bottles!They are way overpriced and they LEAK!It is so frustrating since sometimes they leak- other times they are fine(and the leaking didnt begin right away- and yes- I buy new nipples every few weeks).And sometimes they leak from the plastic ring and other times the nipples just drip like a faucet (and I use newborn size!)It is so upsetting when you spend on sorts of time pumping milk and the instant you tip the bottle it just pours out!I one time lost an entire ounce of breastmilk in one tip- leaked all over my baby in about 2 seconds!Or when you spend money on formula and there it goes down the drain!Crazy!!!It is also so very frustrating when you have a screaming baby and then you have to readjust the bottle 5 times so it wont leak.I also read that the more oxygen that gets into the milk the more it takes vitamins out of the milk.Since the vents are near the nipple every time the baby sucks it drags air through the milk making it less nutritious.Bottom line- try them if you must but be warned that these bottles leak and leak and leak.Do yourself a favor and but Playtex Ventaire Advanced- those bottles rock!Unfortunately, I didn't, and I was very disappointed.These bottles leak all the time!I tried making sure the top wasn't too loose - they still leaked.After a few months I gave up, trashed all of these bottles, and purchased Playtex nursers and Drop Ins - now those are good bottles!I cannot recommend these Avent bottles at all until they get the leaking problem fixed.AVENT seems to have mastered gas - these bottles really DO help prevent gas and colic.I love that the bottles are short and fat instead of long.They fit better into my diaper bag AND cup holders.I have had them leak once or twice but I just unscrew and screw the nipple on and all is well.I ordered three of these and one didn't work.It is an OK big picture indication of the room, but not specific enough to be worth the cost.We have very drafty bedrooms, and an inefficient floor furnace in an old house, so I was very worried about the baby being too cold.I'm guessing it just has to acclimate to the room.Although to me, it seemed like 62 degrees would be a little cold.That's the good zone according to the egg.I'll check with my pediatrician, of course.Not sure what's up with all of the other reviews, but I'm guessing that they didn't give the egg time to adjust to the room.We have wacky radiators and since I am about to have a baby I thought this would be very handy.Not sure about accuracy.We bought two of these since our two babies sleep in two different rooms.Before we were never sure if the temperature was right.When I would be awakened by a crying baby it always seemed to me that the temperature in the room would be too hot.Than after nursing it seemed too cold.Now the eggs tell me instantly if I need to raise or lower the temperature.The glow is soft and does not interfere with sleeping, it is a tad hard to see the numbers on display from a distance, but the color of the egg indicates the correct range.We do not have AC, so adjusting the temperature is often a fine art :-) The price of this product is rather high, but I am glad that we got it.This dragon pacifier is cute and loveable.It has two features: a pacifier and a toy.I sometimes use it when I swaddle my daughter but it doesn't stay in place that well.I thought I would like the wubbanubs because she could hold them but she doesn't do this and they are harder to hold to get them in her mouth than the regular soothies.We basically use the regular soothies most of the time.My son loves to teeth with this Wub and snuggle with the stuffed animal during naps.Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has.We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his "wubbas" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable.And I love that they don't hold water...so no potential mold/mildew problems.It's definately a favorite!Given to a 1 and a half year old as a gift.She was very excited about the net.This is a great toy.We take this with us on trips as a portable bath toy and it works as well in pools.I like that it's BPA free and although it was advertised as a teether, my daughter only used these items as scoops and floaties.Note that you should keep your eye on the net as soaps and bubble baths and other products can eventually turn the net colors making it look filthy.We've had it for over a year before I thought the net was too icky to clean.For the price, this bath toy has had a good length of play time.I bought this product for my nieces and nephew to play with in the tub.I love how the pieces are made of really hard material so the babies can even bite it to help with teething.Great toy for a cheap price!I think that JuJuBe is a great company with a great product!Will soon be buying a smaller version to use as my everyday bag.I chose this bag after looking at the BeTween bag, and the Be All bag and feeling like I needed a little more than what those two bags could offer.The BeTween was a little too small, and the Be All was missing a zipper, which was a must need for me in a bag.I have the Lotus Lullaby print and while I am not much for bags with patterns or ones that scream diaper bag I really like the print on this one.This bag comes with the stroller bag clips, and the luggage tag (at least mine did when I got it at Nordstroms) so there is no need to order those also.One thing to note is that if you do plan on cloth diapering it can be a little heavy when loaded with cloth diapers, and covers.I have since had to switch to disposables and I notice that the bag is a tad lighter than it had been with all of the cloth diaper supplies.I have had the bag for four months now and it's been easy to clean, there have been no manufacturing defects, and I have not had a single issue with any part of the bag.I purchased this bag a few months ago because I need a larger diaper bag for travel and overnight stays.There are 2 large magazine pockets on the outside along with a large mommy pocket for your keys, phone, etc (although I like the mommy pocket on the Be Tween more).The bag can be used as a messenger or as a tote.The material does not stain easily and the bag is easy to clean.The bag can be quite heavy when stuffed but any bag will become heavy when stuffed to the brim.I just purchased this diaper bag to replace my Skip Hop diaper bag that part of the zipper assembly tore out.My daughter is 4 months old so I decided to purchase a sturdier bag with more organization and a bit more stylish since I use the bag both as my purse and a diaper bag.I have enough room to store my nursing cover, Blackberry, iPod, keys, sunglasses, diapers, wipes and any other item I may need to put into the bag.I have the purple paisley and it doesn't seems to show wear as badly as a solid colored bag.I love this bag.My issue is the materials -- my son started chewing the handle of the spoon, and within seconds he had bitten off a chunk of plastic!Turns out the spoon is covered in a plastic material instead of being one solid piece.If you're using them to feed your baby, fine, but for active toddlers who put things in their mouths, this is a real hazard.This concept is great, but in reality these just aren't what we need.Like other reviewers mentioned, the small and shallow design of the utensils makes it hard for my 18-month-old to get anything to stay in the spoon.And the fork won't spear anything - it's basically a spoon with some tiny cutouts on top.I also agree with another reviewer that it's a pain to have to take the spoon back from the child to rebend it in the opposite direction when she switches hands.We haven't had any problems with the plastic coming off, but we use it so infrequently it hasn't really had a chance to malfunction yet.I will say I do like the fork for feeding baked sweet potato to my daughter.Other than that, I have little use for these and just keep them on hand for when the rest of our baby utensils are dirty.Too bad, I love all of Boon's other products.It really helps where my little one has the basic motion down but the wrong angle to get the spoon in her mouth.Also the shape of the spoon head holds the food in well.The whole "1,2,3" setting is kind of stupid.Obviously one would use the 3 setting since it heats the fastest.So the one and two setting are pointless.Just turn it on.Then turn it off when you estimate the milk has reached the desired temperature.But the unit has no timer and you have to track the time on your own.Also, the unit will not turn off by itself.I would think for something this simple, some company can provide a cheaper lower cost product.I don't really understand why there are three settings (1, 2 and 3) when all the recommendations but one tell you to leave it on setting three.The warmer does heat milk up fairly quickly...around 3.5 - 4 minutes for 4 ounces.The only problem is that it can quickly overheat the milk too.The orange light that comes on is confusing because it doesn't seem consistent.You don't have to use Philips Avent bottles with this warmer!As stated in other reviews, the "blinking" light doesn't actually blink...it shuts off for maybe 20 seconds, then turns back on.Also, the warmer emits a soft click when the light turns off (heating element turning off) so if there isn't a lot of other noise, this will alert you that the food is ready as well.We bought the slightly cheaper munchkin bottle and food warmer earlier and it did its job well but being steam based it would cause some uneven warming (though it heats faster).this microwave steam sterilizer is a huge time saver for today's busy family.it sterlizes in only 2 minutes in our 1100 watt microwave... a lot faster than boiling bottles!fits other bottles besides avent.i also use it to sterilize pacifiers and pump parts.bpa free so we don't have to worry about chemicals leaching out of the plastic.constructed well and seems like it will last for a long time.i highly recommend this product.It is so fast and convenient to pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.When not in use, you can easy throw this steamer/sterilizer into the cabinet.I feel like the electric steamers are harder to clean and take up more permanent space on the counter.However, I have to admit that sterilizing in the microwave makes me a tad nervous.We got all BPA free bottles, but I still wonder if they'll find something else wrong wiht htat plastic in the years to come.Because of that, we may use the dishwasher to steam/sterilize intermittently.It is so simple to use and the steam produced sterilizes, bottle, nipples, pacifiers, and whatever else you need.We purchased this product having thought the features side by side most other warmers were impressive.However what is missing from this warming is:Ease of useWhen using any kind of engineered product, it's the subtle differences which count the most.This warmer loses in these areas:#1.The buttons are in a bad location.The side of the warmer makes it difficult to use with a baby in one arm.Yes, you can prop it up against a wall, however "propping up" against a wall shouldn't be any kind of work around a device relies on.#2.This is not obvious at all as most people who would buy any product are not trained to hold buttons down to see their response.#3.While the steam warming action is a great feature, the need to change the water after every use is not.Turning an electric appliance on it's side, potentially risking a electrical shock every time is impractical.#4.Finally, the way you set the warmer gives you no indication on how long you have to listen to your crying baby.I would strongly recommend anybody considering a warmer to get a Dr. Browns warmer instead.It may not be as pretty looking, but it does not have any of the usability issues which I've outlined above.Could be user error, but the milk gets too hot.Not sure if I can put frozen milk bags in this thing... that would be useful.It seems to heat everything perfectly as long as you follow the directions and select the proper settings.I'm able to use it easily with one hand but I can see how it might slide for some people.It's easy to use; however, I cannot understand why you can't re-set the default settings.Or why it doesn't automatically remember your last setting.It's annoying to always be using the same setting but to have to press the buttons like 10 times to get there.This Steam Sterilizer is an excellent product and it works well.You can sterilize just about any bottle in the Philips Avent iQ24.You can sterilize up to 6 bottles at a time and this can be run on a 24 hour cycle.This is a great steamer but just wish it had a drying feature at the end.You can tell that it really cleans everything but I hate having to dry everything at the end.I don't trust the cheaper microwave version so I bought this more expensive steamer version.First it melted my bottle nipples; then, it wouldn't steam at all.I replaced this steamer with a Tommee Tippee brand electric steamer, which I have found to be very reliable.I like this product very much.The only flaw is that the bottles do not dry, rather they remain moist, wet even.Is it a wallet?Is it a purse?Is it a bag?There is an ID card slot and another little slot for a few cards.On the left side, you have a little mesh pocket for a cell phone.There is a little elastic loop in the middle for a lip gloss and you have a mini mirror to check if you have something in your teeth.This bag comes with a wristlet but you also have a an extra longer strap.I purchased this wallet for use on a recent vacation trip.I wanted a bag I could carry close to my body, with a secure zipper closure, and big enough to hold all the basics: a few credit cards, some cash, my driver's license, and my small point and shoot camera (I have a Sony Cybershot).It works really well in wristlet mode - the strap is roomy so it does not cut off circulation, but it is still secure.The zipper pull on the back pocket seems a little flimsy, and the metal star on the front has started to chip a little bit after a month of use.It is machine washable, but after one wash, the dirt still shows on the fabric.And the long strap was not long enough to allow me to wear this crossbody style (which I prefer when traveling, for security reasons), so it was pretty much useless.Still, despite these flaws, I'd still recommend for travel.I use the interior zip pocket for cash and change.The way the top of the head is shaped is supposed to mimic the breast, but I don't think our baby knows that.He hasn't taken it to it as much as I would like him to, basically he will chew it for about 5 minutes and then toss it, but I still love it!So was really resistant to these toys because Sophie's high price tag totally turned me off, and when I read about the chokiness of her long legs, I knew for sure that I didn't want one, but I have to admit that was a little bit jealous of the fabulously cute little French toys that everyone had.Then a friend told me about Chan Pie Gnon.The price was a little lower and he is way cuter, so I I bit the bullet and bought it, totally expecting the baby to hate it.He was very afraid of the squeak at first, but a day or two in and he was chewing and squeaking happily, and now he drags the thing all over the house and gets mad when I put it away.Both of their babies (and older kids) love gnawing on it.This is a great little teether.We have this and Sophie the giraffe, and our son loves both.This one is made of thinner/softer rubber than Sophie, and is a simpler shape, so it's easier for him to get a nice big hunk in his mouth and bear down when his gums are hurting.I also like the handle on the head of the yellow one.The small loop handle also makes it simple to attach the toy to the stroller or carrier we're using with a pacifier clip, so that it's not dropped/lost.He honestly plays with both Sophie and this about the same amount, so I'm happy that we bought both.*Tip: The prices for Vulli products fluctuate wildly on Amazon, so put them in your shopping cart and track them for a week or two to nab it at a low price.Once it's in your shopping cart Amazon will automatically alert you of new pricing on the product.Our Daughter has been teething now for a while and despite trying 4 or 5 different teethers she still keeps just gnawing on her hands.We tried Sophie but she is just too big and awkward for our daughter to get a good hold on.We tried the Gnon (the one witht the loop on his head) and he has been an instant winner.It is made of softer rubber than the rubber Sophie is made of so she can get a good mouthful of him and really chew.She likes that she is actually able to get it to make noise and I like that I can latch it onto her other toys with rings to keep it from ending up on the ground.It is a bit expensive but if it keeps her happy I am ok with the extra money vs. a cheaper one that never gets used.Easy to handle, and they are too cute!First off, our daughter LOVED Chan.Our daughter used it all the time while teething; it was so effective that we didn't know she was teething until her teeth popped out!Sophie was welcomed, but not as much as Chan.We can't say that for many of her other toys!My 5 month old loves this toy!I bought it to test it and save some $$ in case he did not like Sophie the Giraffe since they are similar.or just the entire head!We are purchasing Sophie as well.The dog does go a little nuts everytime it squeeks, but she is getting used to it.My daughter adored this toy so much during its one month lifespan, that we'll more then likely purchase another one.One sad day, the squeaker squeaked no more, which caused its body to no longer inflate (which pretty much left it limp and unusable er...That's What She Said).My older son wasn't very interested in sticking this toy in his mouth, but he did love to squeeze it and hear it squeak.He chews on the top of the toy, the "cheeks" and the feet.He really gets himself worked up.The only problem we've had is that it doesn't hand was well.I have stuck it into the dishwasher witht eh bottles and it's held up well.But I don't want to do it too often because I'm worried about how long it's going to stay in one piece.But overall, this is a really nice teether.We bought the blue Chan when our youngest was an infant.I wish I'd found this toy when my eldest daughter was a baby, because it is a fabulous baby toy and teether!I love that it's BPA-free, and it's super soft and easy for an infant to grab onto and squeeze.Other teething rings are often too heavy for a baby to hold, or they're cold all over, or they're made with BPA.And as a previous poster pointed out, the prices do fluctuate a lot, and if you save it in your shopping cart for later, you can be sure to catch it when the price drops.Bought Chan for our 6 month old son and he shoes plenty of interest in him!Mine doesn't have a strong rubber smell like others have complained of.Although my dog does try to get at it all the time since it really does squeak like a dogs toy lol!Actually a few family members asked why I gave my son a dog toy!Also, mine is much more blue then this picture shows.It is an expensive teether toy but I feel it is worth it.This one is softer than the giraffe, and seems like it would be easier to chew.My 4.5mo daughter loves it, immediately she was able to hold it and put in her mouth.It's a lot smaller than I thought it would be.The amazon customer pictures don't depict the size of this very well.I figured it would be just a tad smaller than Sophie, but it's only about 4 inches tall, maybe almost 5.Unless your kids have a giraffe fetish, I would recommend any of these other Vulli alien looking teethers over Sophie.Also these are much cheaper than Sophie, and much softer on the gums.These are supersoft.(Even though baby isn't all that worried about it) I felt wasteful, though, when throwing away liners after each pee and poop.I like the Imse Vimse that are also flushable, but can be washed if only peed on.These liners work fine for me (they are the only ones I have tried).The large size are kind of an odd shape IMO, I fold them in half or tuck them around the diaper insert.I am new to the mother/diaper game, but I knew cloth diapers were the route I wanted to go.I purchased 2 rolls to start with, but I am now going to purchase the large size b/c I think it will take care of the coverage issue.We started using the small liners when my baby was 8lbs and it still was not enough for her smaller 'output'.I would recommend the product but try the large size first.buy the large!I chose the green and the yellow version.They really are pretty cute bibs, however when I got them I realized they were a little small for my 5 month old.Then I washed them and they shrank.I did not try to put it back on my child because I didn't want to choke her.I think that it would have been nice to know that someone would have suggested an age range for this product.I would not suggest this product unless it was for a child of 0-3 months of age.Those bibs are cute and soft, however they are very small for my 4 months old!Didn't fit at all.We used these when our baby were under 1 months old to swaddle the baby.The one from Amazon is thin, much lighter weight and the blanket hair falls off easily.I've always suspected if Amazon sold me a fake, but I doubt it.It's a possibility that these two blankets are from different batches, and carters factory didn't make them to the same specification, even though they were supposed to follow the exact same spec.This bag could have easily gone for more than what it's listed for here.I purchased the Lotus Lullaby print, and love it so much!I received 2 compliments from moms within the first weekend that I used it.It's genius when you don't want to cart around a huge diaper bag.I clipped it to my purse, and it was noticed more than a few times.I can see myself using this a TON, maybe keeping a well stocked diaper bag in the back of my car but pulling from there to refill this and just take this with me.I love Ju Ju Be products and bought this in Midnight eclipse and Dizzy Daisies.I like this bag because I can use it alone for a quick trip, or in addition to my larger matching diaper bag.But can also be used alone for a quick run in somewhere for a fast change.It does not include a change pad though, so you'll have to bring a disposable pad or blanket.I love how it is machine washable like the rest of their products and even think it will make a cute wrist-let mini purse when baby is bigger.I love the Ju-Ju-Be product line and this is one of my favorites.They make their products with moms in mind.These Be Quicks can be used inside diaper bags and other bags to organize your items.I have put a travel size of diaper cream and some plastic diaper disposal bags in there and there is still more room.As for the print I received the Dizzy Daisies print and it is a fun print.I love that the bags are made from Teflon and they have anti-microbial linings.They are also machine washable.They are amazing bags and you should collect many Quicks if you want to organize your life.We ordered this changing table ( Cherry ) because it had a good deal (120 $ at the time).We recieved this table in one week after ordering.Packaging was alright- little rips but nothing major!it took my husband about an hour to put it together!And i was supriesed how nice it actually looked!and bigger then i expected.I purchased these pacifiers so that I could keep them by the crib with the idea that I would be able to easily spot them in the dark in the middle of the night.Unfortunately, these pacifiers don't glow in the dark as advertised so if you are buying them for that purpose you may want to think twice.I wish he would stop since they clean up great in the wash.Anyway, he picked these up instead thinking they were better since they were a little more.Wrong.We dried them on low but the plastic is still a little melted.We use these in the kitchen now for drying pots & pans & they work great!We use the Gerber pads for the changing table, they are great, you can dry them on high & no piles or anything.I gave it 2 stars only because I use them for drying dishes now & like them for that.They are fairly durable.The problem is that the backing gets a little melty in the drier and sticks to itself, which can lead to tearing when you try to pull it apart.I had about half of them 2 years later, which is not bad.I just bought another set to use in our second child's room.It is MUCH EASIER to keep the changing pad clean with these handy little covers.Just remember DO NOT put these in the dryer...I made that mistake.So glad I have these!Don't wast your money.Your better off just buying extra "plush" cover tops and changing those out instead.Waste of money.I usually give good reviews for most products I buy, but I was really shocked at how bad these liners were.For some reason, they are not the same as the liner you get with the slipcover/liner set.The liner included in the set is much better made.After the first wash, the material on top shrank a bit (no I didn't stick it in the dryer) and it wouldn't sit flat on the changing pad anymore.It became a chore trying to get the baby on the liner when it kept curling up on me.But the cheaply-made replacement liners completely ruin in.I threw all my liners away and ended up just going back to using slipcovers only.I love this product!I've been using and washing the same 3 pads for almost 2 years and have had no problems.They lie flat and don't fray.I didn't realize until reading a review that these have special washing instructions.So I wasn't going to review this product, however, people need to read the directions.We have machine washed them more times than I care to count (warm and on gentle cycle).We lay them flat to dry as the directions specifically state.These are awful.Terrible purchase.After unsuccessfully trying to get them to lay flat I threw them away.What a waste.My baby girls like to sit in it, sliding up and down and she likes to play with a teething toy.We have had this slide chair for 2+ months now and our daughter loves it.Another thing we did to increase the excitement is to add a dangling rattle to the exiting toys (which are really dull on their own) so she can kick it for more stimulation and noise.That's a big hit.I have a couple cautions though:  Zoe can now push hard enough that the chair slides backwards on the tile floor with each good thrust.I don't have carpet but I suspect it wouldn't happen on that as much.Second, now that she is stronger she is trying to sit up.Once day she managaged to pull herself up on the foot frame and toys.If she hadn't been belted in well she would have fallen out and hit her head.Now I pile pillows on the sides just to be sure it doesn't happen again when I'm not looking.The seat is just not quite big enough with a cloth diaper on and at her length.Now her head hits the top unless she is sitting low in the chair.She has just a little time left in it due to her height, but she's ready for a bouncer now.Unlike the reviews posted after one day of use, I can say that we have had more than 2 months of daily happy use.My baby doesn't like this thing at all.He'll just sit in it and not kick.I just wish it didn't cost so much because it's alot of money to spend and you never know if your baby is going to be one of them that likes it or not.He's 5 months old.Maybe he'll like it better later when he has more energy and weight to push around.Our 5 month old has slept in this since we brought him home from the hospital.It grows with him, and he loves kicking off of it.The music is fun, and of all the musical baby toys, this is the least obnoxious BY FAR.The sleepy music is soothing, and even helps Mommy go to sleep.We were not comfortable laying him flat on his back to sleep since our baby had bad reflux.I think for the price they could have tried to make it look better.I was disappointed when I first saw it.He used to get scared and cry when we put him in there.Now at 4 months old he has almost grown out of it.So we could only use it for a very short period of time.But within this time, he liked sitting here.So sometimes he would sit here for 20 minutes at a time.We also noticed that sitting in this seat would make him poop.I think this is due to the seat incline and the fact that he had to work with his legs, whatever the cause, the result was positive :).If this seat was a little better made and had a taller seat, I would give it 5 stars - otherwise it gets 4.It has made life much easier.Holds his Gum Drop pacifiers perfectly (two fit with ease and I could probably squeeze in another if I had to).I also used this to hold a nipple shield that I had to use when I first started breastfeeding and my baby was having latch problems.I needed something to attach to my diaper bag where I could get at a pacifier quick.This works well, good quality structure, and good basic black.Very good quality - won't fall off when it is clipped to diaper bag or stroller, etc.It also has elastic inside to hold the pacifiers so they don't just spill out when you unzip the holder.The Ju Ju Be Paci Pod Pacifier Holder matches the other products we purchased and it makes it easy to keep up with our granddaughter pacifier.It does what it is supposed to do, holds your pacifiers in.It has two elastics on each side to hold them securely so they don't fall out when you open the pod.These absorb spit-up amazingly well, which means more use out of each one as a burp cloth.And the spit-up hardly shows.So soft and fluffy -- makes for a nice fabric for my baby's cheek when he's getting burped.I love that they are organic.They soak up any spit-up, vomit, and any form of milk very well.I ordered these because I need heavy duty burp clothes for my daughter with reflux.I thought they would be similar in quality to regular diaper service premium diapers I had bought for my older daughter in 2006.I was wrong.I don't recommend this product.We got them initially for diapers.Because of other reasons we went to the disposable diapers but we used these for spills, burp cloths and other things that needed a quick towel for cleanup and i must say they absorb very well.I ordered these so that I could have a few cloth diapers in case of rash, but mostly so that I could make a few personalized burp clothes by sewing additional fabrics to them.I recommend this product to anyone looking for organic high quality items (diapers/burp clothes).These are a great deal, but the organic fabric is an odd almost silky thread instead of the normal cotton I expected.It does not seem like they would be very absorbent like the regular cotton reusable diapers are for burp cloths.I don't even want to use them as burp cloths.Not good in comparison with indian prefold diapers from places like Green Mountain, Little Lions, etc.These will barely hold a few ounces of liquid without leaking.I won't be using them as diapers, though.That brand of organic was also much cheaper than these.In comparison these diapers are thin, rough, badly hemmed, small, and cut crooked (which makes folding harder and contributes to them getting misshapen in the wash).Crazy, also, that they cost more than competing organics of better quality.I used these for baby spills, drool, and other baby misc needs.I like these crinkled shoes.I bought them for my daughter's baptism, but I'm likely to use them with other dresses for church, etc.The bows are very cute and the crinkled satin hides stains well.We went from barely needing one to barely living w/o it.I love this monitor so far!Well only had it for a few days.It is a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be.I guess the picture makes it look like it's huge and I had not read the dimensions of this monitor so I was expecting it to be a big monitor but it totally isn't.It is quite compact and cute.Let me just tell you how I used this monitor in.I used at my mother-in-law's house which is a single family home with 4 bedrooms and 2 floors.Then I used it at my own home which is a 1300sq ft condominum.still functional if plugged into adapter while recharging.-can put batteries into baby unit as well but you got to buy these extra.Things I dislike:-beeps somewhat loudly when you press the volume buttons on the parent unit so don't do it if someone is sleeping next to you-indicator lights on parent unit are really bright which could be negative to other people (to me not a big deal since i put it on the floor next to my bed)-too bad there's no second parent unit.this was a big plus about my previous monitor but the parent unit does have rechargeable batteries in it that come with when you buy anyhow so you can just take wherever.i've only used it off the adapter for about 4 hours so far after the first recharge.-it is quite expensive but hopefully worth it if it can last for a few years.The first monitor we bought was the Graco 49mhz ultra clear ii monitor.We could hear other people sometimes too.We could still hear the baby when he cries but it was with the static in background.The static was just so annoying at night and we would just turn the unit off sometimes.Living in an older condo too, I'm sure the other tenants (who are elderly people) had same frequency electronics that makes it worse.But we just gave in after 5 months of bearing with the static and bought this Philips one, we're happy with our buy so far!We previously used a video monitor system that claimed to have "no interference" however, living in a heavily populated area with tons of electronic devices you can say we had some issues; Snaps, crackles and pops every night and nonstop at that.In fact, with the sensitivity settings, you can even set it so you only get it when the little one is at a sound level you want to hear!These means I don't have to hear the general non stop chatter that ours does just before he completely crashes.Instead I have ours set so that I'll hear him just before he gets worked up.What this means is more sleep for me!And, in fact, more sleep for him as I'm not trying to wake him up prematurely.The other great benefit is that the device acts as a two way radio.This is great as if my spouse is feeding the little master, we can still converse from the other room (and vice versa on that).The general quality feels like a good piece of plastic.Bar None.We previously received a different baby monitor which turned itself off the second night we used it and constantly chirped and buzzed all night long.even when baby was sleeping Mom and Dad weren't.After doing research and reading many reviews, we went with the Philips Avent digital and have never looked back.The speaker on the parent unit is not as loud as I would like, but the LED lights are very responsive (they blink when our loud upstairs neighbors' kids jump) and I can always hear when baby needs me.The light on the baby unit has come in handy too, when looking for a lost pacifier.Overall, I'd highly recommend this monitor!This is a great monitor.As long as I turn off the hand-held device when I'm not using it, I can use it all day without recharging.The low battery beep is a little loud, so I try to avoid that going off as that could potentially wake up the baby.I've experienced no problems with interference with cordless phones, routers, etc.I LOVE this monitor.The sound is crystal-clear.I have no idea what other reviewers are talking about when they say the volume is too low on this monitor.Perhaps they have the base too far away from the crib?I think the volume is excellent on this monitor--I can hear my baby BREATHING and the monitor is on a shelf next to her crib.The monitor holds a charge for about 11 hours and has a really long range.I highly recommend this product.Usually we just keep it plugged in next to us, but it's a huge inconvenience when if in the morning it's left unplugged, then by the time we come home from work - less than 12 hrs later - the battery is always completely dead and the unit can't even be turned on.Philips falsely advertises 24 hour battery life, but then mentions in the manual that if it's used at full volume, battery life is lower.Hmm... much, much lower, and it's baloney because obviously I want to hear my child, and therefore, obviously I will have the volume up.If trying to use the unit for its intended purpose means you can't get 24-hr battery life out of it, then it shouldn't be advertised as such.We haven't had any interference issues from any other monitors in the area.(ie- we haven't heard conversations from anyone else's house).Hopefully no one has heard ours!(I can't vouch for that though).We get more like 9 hours.I followed the instructions exactly and still don't get much longer than 9 hours.But 9 hours is long enough for us so its not too much of an issue.We LOVE this monitor.It was completely worth the money.It has a long range on it (we can use it all over out 1500sq/ft house - including outside) the volume control is great, and there is zero static.Not only did they replace her monitor, but they sent her the upgraded version with the LCD screen.Hers works perfectly.I would buy this again and highly recommend it.Edit 1/20/2011:We are now on our third monitor!I called Philips Avent and they mailed me a new one (this was in July 2010).They sent me an exact replacement.A couple of weeks ago the same thing happened again to our second monitor.I called Philips Avent and they just mailed me another replacement.I asked them if this was normal, and they said it wasn't.If this third monitor fails again I'll be sure to post another edit.It's a bummer because when the monitor actually works it rocks.Can't say enough about this monitor!NEVER has static or feeback from the phones.We took it on vacation and it worked so well!What we thought was a bit of static turned out to be the window fan in the baby's room!The blue lights are fab, when we have the A.C. on you can't hear the monitor as well (we didn't turn it up enough) but the lights wake us up so it's great.We have had other monitors and even tried using an intercom system but NOTHING compares to the Avent monitor, it's the best thing ever invented!After having to deal with a baby monitor that all I could hear was static I went out in search of a GOOD monitor.We have cell phones, wireless internet, a ton of technology in our house, and tons of neighbors with the same.Therefore the interferance was horrible to deal with using my old monitor.I LOVE my new monitor!There is never any static with this one!When I found this monitor I was a little hesitant because of the price, however now that I am using it, I LOVE IT!I noticed some people complained about how "soft/quiet" it is, but if you turn up the volumn a little there isn't any issues!Now if you have a ton of noise if your house, I could see it being harder to hear the monitor.I just replaced our older monitor with this one and the difference is amazing.This little monitor is crystal clear and doesn't produce any static.I haven't had any of the problems of not immediately hearing my baby, but I do have the sensitivity set at 5.I have noticed that when my son is facing towards the monitor I can hear him breathing, but when he is facing away from it I can't.There is no static at all, the battery still works fantastic.I've been so happy with this monitor and think that it has been well worth the money spent.I thought this would be a great monitor based on reviews.Don't buy this!Don't make the same mistake we did and get stuck with the product.You absolutely cannot hear your baby cry.I could hear my son crying louder from his room than from the actual monitor.Imagine leaving your baby with a sitter or grandparent and they cannot hear your baby cry!We love this monitor.I bought it after reading all the reviews and it lives up to the hype.The sound is clear and I took the parent set all the way into the middle of the street during our block party and had great reception the entire time.The temperature monitor is a wonderful addition as our thermostat registers the downstairs temperature so the upstairs can either be too hot or too cold.I actually turn the volume down when I put it next to our bed at night because it picks up every little movement and it keeps me up at the highest setting.I did a lot of research and landed on this one but when I got it, it hardly even stays cold for more than 10 minutes.Disappointed.It doesn't stay cold for long, but that doesn't seem to matter.My baby likes it anyway.I love the little animals...I also bought them for my daughter so I could link them onto her play gym, they are too fat for the holes in the playgym, but i use them for other things and they work out just fine.They are thick and durable.The ones without the animals will hold other toys.I used to use these to clip toys onto my son's stroller so he wouldn't lose them when we went out, but I lost them btwn kidsso I needed another set for my daughter.They are alot thicker then the ones I used to have so I am hoping that they work just as well.Not only are the figures on the molded rings interesting and chewable for my son (now 13 months), but the round textured rings make excellent toy holders on the stroller bar, Baby Bjorn strap, backpack handle, diaper bag strap, etc.We take collections of toys and random binkies, all strung together on these amazingly durable rings, everywhere we go.We even leave the groupings linked together in the toy box, so Duncan can pull things out and manipulate the bunches, which he enjoys enormously.I highly recommend these rings for babies from 6 months to 2 years +.Great for connecting toys to a baby gym, car seat, play at the changing table, etc...Very bright, colorful and interesting for the baby.My daughter wants to play just with the links, the toy at the end doesn't interest her as much.So I think the purpose of these is to link toys to other things, but my baby LOVES playing with just the rings all linked together.They are brightly colored, good for chewin' and you can bang them on the table really loud.And seriously portable, too.You can make several chains and have one for the high chair, the diaper bag, the car seat, the tub.I bought this as an alternative to my big, heavy double stroller.Now that my kids are a little older (2.5 and 1), I wanted something I could easily throw in my trunk for a trip to the park, etc.I don't have to worry about the kids getting too hot while sitting in it.After our first trip to Disney World, I was super impressed!It was easy to manuver, the kids both napped comfortably in it, I was able to hang my backpack on the middle handle for storage, and it cleaned up very easily after a spill.Overall, for the price, this stroller was a great buy!Pros:-lightweight and easily maneuverable-folds easily-adjustable positioning-vented back flaps-2 pouches on either side-good height for the handles.I'm 5'4" and hubby is 6' and we both push it easily.Cons:-cupholder doesn't really work - the plastic that fits onto the bar loosens and then either slides down the bar or just falls off completely.-the sun canopies are flimsy and annoying.They pop off when the stroller folds and won't stay in any other position that completely upright; also, they are too narrow, so you have to constantly shift them as you move in and out of the sun.I just took them off altogether and have my kids wear hats and sunglasses.-the middle wheel does get in the way sometimes if you're holding the outer handles.It looks cute, fits through any door and is reasonably priced.I was really excited to buy this product, but after minimal use the right canopy broke off and my toddler further damaged the stroller by breaking her foot rest.I live on an island were we have a few months of typhoon season where it rains ALL the time.I was worried about mildew and mold (a bad problem out here because of the humidity) a long with keeping my baby dry.I love this product and has held up through the first season and is good shape for next.I would tell any mom to make this a must to get if you are in a rainy place.they also make one just for the car seat which is GREAT as well for the times you just use the carseatThe off-gassing from the plastic is really awful, like the kind you get from a cheap shower curtain.We let it air out for a full week before using this weather shield because it was so smelly.Still, it fits our Graco Snugride 22 carseat + Graco stroller frame quite well, so in the end, this product did work out.That offgassing contains some nasty chemicals, ones that I don't particularly want my child breathing in quantity.Thus, I strongly suggest that you air it out for a few days as I did before using on the stroller, as the smell is even more concentrated from your child's perspective :)We received this in the mail today.The stars are clear on the ceiling.It lights up blue, green, or both.Instead, the blue and green both project a little offset from one another.It makes me think I'm missing my 3-D glasses.~Seriously consider the 'optimal' placement recommendation for this item: middle of the room, five feet from the ceiling.Does ANYONE have a way of doing this reliably while still being child-safe??I had a table for the turtle that I placed at the foot of my baby's crib and that worked okay with our 8'ceilings, but then my little guy managed to pull the table over and after a trip to the ER, I realized I was out of options for placement until he's older.I could put something in the middle of the room each night, but he still wakes at night so this would be a safety issue for us when we go to him.AND it'd be a safety issue for him at some point when he is mobile at night.Maybe I bought this for him too young, but the optimal placement recommendation is an issue at any age if you want to get the most from this night light.My baby is really having trouble falling asleep, so we bought this so she could look at it and sooth herself to sleep.But, the darn thing shuts off before she's asleep!Even if she did fall asleep before the timer shuts off, she wakes periodically and it would be nice to have the stars there to greet her and lull her back to sleep.Now it's just another thing I have to babysit, by waking up every 45 minutes to turn it back on.This is a total disappointment!!!The turtle is soft and the stars are easy to turn on and off.Definitely worth the money!This is a necessity.The bath toy holder comes with tape to mount it, but this is a much better option.We have it full of toys, with lots of bottles of shampoo and soap on the top shelf, and it hasn't fallen once.I can't imagine why it has not worked for others.I just made sure the suctions were not sitting on top of any grout lines for a tighter fit.Washed sheets only and stored in closet for use, found two holes when using sheet for first time.This crib sheet so soft.I also have this in brown.I have a feeling these will last me for a while.It hugs the crib mattress even though the crib is smaller than the standard ones.Very satisfied.I bought this sheet in pink and in green, both are great.They fit our IKEA crib mattress easily, which is not at all how the IKEA covers fit after being washed.They look luxurious, and are very well made.I only wish they had these in queen size for my bed!It is unbelievably soft and I think he sleeps better on it.Maybe it has nothing to do with the new sheet but prior to getting these sheets my son would wake up once during the night and cry for (seemingly) no reason.After the sheet, no more middle of the night wake ups (and it's been 3 weeks).Don't make the same mistake I did.Once you start using this you won't want to use anything else in your child's bed.SO SOFT!I got similar sheets, not as soft though, from a discount store & they didn't even stay on!It's my favorite crib sheet, I wish all of my sheets were this material!I'm planning to stock up on this inexpensive yet quality sheet and wish I could buy it in a queen size for my own bed!She wears thick sleepers but the bed always seems sooo cold that I wanted to find a sheet that was warmer.I use to put her on her basic cotton sheet and it would shock her awake probably from the cold temp of the sheet itself and now nothing.I got the chocolate brown as I thought it would stay cleaner and this is no means the case, but i still like the richness of the color.Even after multiple washes it still as soft as the day we opened it.One of the two fell apart on the FIRST wash (in delicate cycle, line dried)-- the elastic part came apart, so now the sheet is no longer fitted/snug on the crib mattress.On the plus side-- the velour is very soft, initially had a nice fit on the mattress, and at least one of the two has held up.I have only washed it once as baby isn't here yet- that's the only thing keeping me from giving this a 5 star review.I would like some for my own bed!I wish they had a sheet set option with a pillow cover and top sheet because it is for my toddler who will be adjusting to a big boy bed soon.That being said, these are not perfect.I have not had a problem before with other sheets: Pottery barn sheets are an appropriately snug fit for our crib mattress and our Circo sheets are actually too tight to get on without damaging them (ripped a hole in one the last time I tried to use them!)Since these are for my almost-two year old, I'm not too worried, but might try to pull them a lot tighter when my newborn takes over the crib.I also like them because they aren't cold to touch like regular cotton sheets.My baby has softer sheets than I do now!feedback I sent Saftey 1st:I recently bought your "spring 'n release latches" and I feel compelled to inform you that the design is so thoughtless that is makes me doubt all of your other products.The design consists of a spring loaded plastic injected "latch" that interfaces with a plastic injected "catch".A sloped surface on the latch is suppose to make contact with the catch causing the latch to deflect downward until it fully passes the catch as the door is completely closed.Unless a user pushes the latch down the catch will keep the door from opening.What is beyond comprehension about this design is that the catch does not have adequate sloping on the surface that is interfaced by the latch as the door is being closed from the full open position.What this results in is a very minute adjustment range that does not either cause the latch to crash into the catch and prevent door closure or or the latch being adjusted so low that the catch does not retain the door when a child attempts to open.After installing three of these assemblies and having to precisely tweak each latch to the perfect height to keep it from either not closing or not latching, I decided to remove all of your product and return to the store.I have serious doubts about them staying in proper adjustment for the years I intend to need them.As a mechanical engineer with many years of design experience, my only guess is that you had a summer intern design this product and then failed to do any testing or installation verification.There appears to be no reason why the ramping surface of the catch should have a near vertical face and then transition into only a short ramping region.Consider redesigning the catch so the latch can not crash to a dead stop and prevent door closure.This will make installation many times easier as well as reduce the need for readjustments and replacements later.From my estimate of installing three there appears to be less than a 1/16 of an inch in latch elevation that does not cause either no close or no lock.As the other reviews have noted, this is a great bumper.Only thing to add is the hilarity value...  My 2 month old son tried to nurse on one of the 'bumps' on the bumper.heheheVery cute, soft, plush, and my baby likes it!We wanted somthing special but could not see paying 500 for a bedding set.So we went with this and the Tadpoles tulle crib skirt.Added a few hot pink touches (monogramming) and it is cute, super soft and budget friendly.Love love love this bumper!Bought it for my mom's house and was really impressed with the quality.I like this one better than the Pottery Barn Kids one we have at home.Super soft and ties very easily and stays put well.If I'd known about this one in the first place I would have saved a lot of money!This bumper is so soft and nice.My baby loves it, he rubs his foot on it to put himself to sleep.Best bumper we have bought so far.It is super soft.Our crib is a converted crib with a bit wood piece for the headboard, we had no problem with that at all.These bumpers are great for the price.The ties are a bit short (thus minus 1 star) but it's still doable.I held off on buying a bumper because of the SIDS risk.I eventually bought a breathable bumper to keep my son from putting his arms and legs through the crib bars.However, he still constantly banged into the sides of the crib with his head all night.Since he is now nine months old, I decided he could have a real bumper in his crib and purchased this one.The best thing of all is that our son no longer is banging his head into the crib and waking himself up at night.He is getting much better sleep now and I think he actually feels more secure now that he feels more "enclosed."This bumper is great and was a great price (much less than buying a bedding set.)It goes great with my Carter's jersey sheets."Don't buy anything else!The super soft jersey is so stretchable that changing sheets is a snap!We'll probably be buying more of these.These crib sheets are nice and soft.They feel thicker and warmer than regular sheets, so they are great when its cold.The price was great and I am very glad I purchased these sheets along with Carter's super soft bumper instead of buying a whole bedding set.I probably saved about $100 this way.I highly recommend these sheets!Even though these sheets are still somewhat thin and would benefit from doubling w/a waterproof mattress protective cover, it's great for the price!They got softer after washing and although it shrank slightly, it fits my mattress snugly.I also ordered sheets from American Baby Company and these are better.I then washed the sheets in cold water and dried them - wow are they SUPER snug now!I had to do some serious pulling to get the sheet on the mattress.I will be trying out other sheet options.I'm afraid to see what will happen after these sheets are washed more than once.For the price, I really think it's a great buy.I have yet to wash it several times before I can comment on how well it washes.But they do fade quite a bit after just one wash.Light weight sheet but it look good the same as the other crib sheet I brought for double the price.I am not a fan of dot print but it give a good look with the modern look we are going for.I bought these sheets, they are perfect.great fit(mattress size is 130/70/10cm), soft good quality cotton, breathable, yet thick ( it's not see through, as someone else said).I believe it will also fit a 15 cm mattress.The price is good.They fit actually a little big, but nothing to worry about.My daughter(s) are not going to get caught up in the extra material or anything, and I'd rather have them a tad big than too small (already had fitted sheets too small and it's a pain trying to get them to fit on the mattress).This is a pretty typical bed sheet.It was exactly what I expected a bed sheet for $9.99 would be.I gave it 4 stars because it met my expectations.This conversion kit helped me save money on bottles by allowing me to use my Medela Freestyle pump with existing Avent bottles that we'd previously purchased.The alternative would have been to pump into the Medela bottles and then transfer the milk to the Avent, but this kit makes it so much easier.There are four pieces per kit: 2 converters to pump directly into any Avent bottle/Avent milk storage set that are identically shaped as the bottles and 2 converters to pump directly into the Avent VIA line of milk storage.The converters screw onto the bottom of the flanges where you would normally screw a Medela bottle, adding just one more piece to the normal pump setup.I bought this for my Britax Roundabout car seat, and even though it looked too small, it actually completely covered the car seat.We've only used it once, but it made it to and from gate check just fine.It could have been made with a better carrying handle, but it's doable.Since we wanted to gate check our car seat and stroller (Baby jogger City Classic single), we borrowed another one for that and with the wheels removed, it fit, too!This bag does what it is supposed to do: protect from dirt and debris, NOT pad and cushion!However, the long carry strap broke where the strap was sewn together through the plastic loop, with only the weight of the carseat in it (A Chicco KeyFit).We looped it back through and tied it in a knot, and were able to carry it again just fine.I bought this car seat bag for when I was traveling with my son.The description makes it sound like it will fit any carseat.I have two different kind of car seats (brand and styles) and I had to bring the smaller of the two and remove the headrest in order for it to fit into this bag.If you have a bigger car seat, this bag might not be the bag for you.It's very roomy for an infant car seat that you could pack the base in it oo, although we have not tried.The zipper stays closed and I even throw extra jackets, burp cloths and food containers in it at the gate before we board.Great buy and worth the money!Lots have been said about this chair, we personally have 3 in Cherry and absolutely love them.A few things to add, though.1) They are meant to be used on wood floors.That is important with toddlers who like to push themselves away from the table around one years old.I personally don't know of anyone with kids who have carpeting under their table, but I guess some people do.2) Make sure you are adjusting the seat and foot rest properly.Highly suggest you follow the directions and never allow the foot rest to come out further than the front legs of the chair.Bringing the child TO the table early on allows them to feel this connection, so I personally will never buy the tray and think it's a waste.I found the chair impossible to keep clean and hated the seating positions that our family was forced to assume at meals because of it.Over a period of three months I grew to HATE mealtimes because of the chair and finally splurged on the Stokke.It is like night and day.The stokke is simple to wipe clean.His feet no longer dangle.All in all I am very glad that I purchased this chair.It is built to last, safe, has the ability to grow with your child (I'm not sure he will be using it when he is 7 but it will surely be around), and doesn't look like the typical eye-sore high chair.First, the product is very well built yet easy to assemble.Once put together you will never feel like this is ever going to collapse no matter what you do to it.I've sat on it while playing with our son and there are no signs that it is suffering under my weight so your toddler (I hope) will be no challenge for it.It is also great to have something that lets the child sit right at the table with you versus needing a separate tray.And as he grows, the chair can be adjusted so no matter how big they get (until they use a real chair) the Stokke will be the chair of choice fot them).It is also very stable.He also is pretty unlikely to rock and make it fall over either.I suppose anything is possible but he has tried a lot and it slides back but never tips over in any direction.The wood finish cleans up easily and unlike a lot of chairs looks like actual furniture versus some piece of medical equipment or junky toy like so many high chairs.In a world filled with kiddie things it is nice to have a high chair that is just a high chair- no pink or blue, no animals, just a great product.I was somewhat hesitant to order this given the bad reviews - but can't figure out what the problem the others have.I did, before ordering online, try this chair out in the store with my, then 5 month old, son.He loved it - and we had no problem getting in and out.He's now 7 and a half months old and we still love this chair.I lift him in an out of it several times a day without protest from him.I just loop them on the back of the baby set, and we're good to go.I think some negative reviews may come from expectations that this item will last for a long time and are disappointed when their child outgrows it.It is disappointing that it does not come with the chair, but this way you can mix and match colors.We got the baby set in green to go with our natural wood chair to have a big more fun with the color and love it.She is not able to sit on her own yet but in here she can.We chose to skip the cushion and dont miss it.This set allowed us to have her in the stokke high chair as soon as she was ready to start on solids.We were then also able to skip the bumbo and other transitional chairs.Haven't washed it yet... still waiting for baby.It just came in the mail today.It looks the same as it did the day I purchased it.The fabric also seemed a bit stiff.Your child will probably not even care if they had a cushion or not.They aren't easy to take off to clean either.I wound up spending most of my time washing these bad boys and looping them back into the seatbelts.After the fifth time, I stopped and my daughter actually preferred to sit on the wood chair.It also made it easier for her to climb in and out of the chair as she got older.Save your money and skip this accessory.It fits really well over the wide railing.For the reviews that complain that the velcro tabs are on the inside, just turn the thing around.Our 13-month old son does like to pull the velcro tabs and he has removed the cover a couple of times.A version of the tabs that use a sturdy snap or button closure might be better as long as they didn't pose a choking hazard.My solution was to just add a basting stitch around the velcro tabs.Now he can't undo them.i also got the side ones for my little boys crib.As other reviewers have said, toddlers can undo the velcro.Two possible solutions are:1) Put the velcro tabs on the outside of the crib where the baby can't reach.This has the disadvantage that some velcro is exposed on the outside of the crib to catch on Mom and Dad's clothes when putting the baby down.2) Use the product inside out so vecro tabs are on the inside.Not what you want after spending 30 minutes rocking the baby to sleep!!!But I am going to look for a different cover that uses ties (on the outside!)rather than velcro.I was disappointed in this cup.My child did not like the nubby bumps on the nipple or spout and therefore refused to drink from the cup.I thought the handles were awkward to attach and it often leaked.I am glad that I did.My 9 month old has been using it since she was 6 months old.She now holds cups and objects quite well when she attempts to feedherself.excellent sleeper by Halo.embroidered animals are very cute and the sack works great like all the other Halo sleep sacks we bought.Get this if you have Dr Brown bottles, 8 oz.It takes no time at all and they are sterilized.I just wish it did  more at one time!I found that hand washing is much more efficient for me, as I am breast feeding, so I rarely have the bottles to sterilize.So getting everything out and exactly measured and waiting it all out took way more trouble then just washing and drying the bottles.3 stars cause im neutral.I purchased these for their color, the fact that they are flannel, and that they are supposedly made with organic cotton.This lasts for over 6 hours!Although the cotton may be organic, we of course do not know what sizing chemicals, dyes, etc, were used in producing these sheets.I have washed these sheets many, many times and the problem remains.What a waste!Also, color is not soft sage, more of a very pale army.My daughter was addicted to swaddling... we could not get any sleep unless she was tightly wrapped up.My little Houdini had no trouble getting her hands out, and because of that she did not sleep as well.Also because of the large amount of velcro used, it is harder to fasten.I really like this as a sleep sack but as a swaddle it did not work.The material was too loose and would just get really big so he was able to easily get out of it.But I really like it just as a sleep sack.We have transited to this now that he is older and it works like a charm, especially at night!!YES!Pros:-keeps the kiddo from busting out for the most part-the swaddle doesn't ride up on the kiddo face provided you use the velcro closures on the bottom-I LOVE the fact that the zipper zips DOWN not up.Using this was NIGHTMARE because you have to change newborns soo many times and accomodate for 2 hour feedings.It was just easier initally to use the simple velcro summer swaddle that allowed you to change just the bottoms or old school swaddle blanket.2am is not a time where you want to mess with putting your newborns arms in the swaddle "dress".-We only started using this after 3 months once he started busting his legs and arms out of the velcro Summer swaddle-it's more expensive than other swaddles out there but well worth the price for a full nights rest!We like the sleepsack portion of it, so easy to unzip and even take off if you need to clean up your baby a little bit more after a diaper change.It also gives the baby more room to move his/her arms around instead of right by his side, like with the Miracle Blanket.There is also pretty darn secure velcro straps to the bottom on the swaddle attachment and at the back so it won't slide up and down when your little one moves and wiggles about.Plus the swaddle portion will keep his/her arms warm.My little one also likes sleeping in the sleepsack portion during the day time and in his Graco pack 'n play napper portion.During the night we use the swaddle portion in the Arms Reach co-sleeper.I would recommend to buy at least 2, just in case one gets soiled, you have another on hand.I have many different sippy cups with different spouts, handles, straws, & sizes.As with all bigger sippy cups w/o handles you have to always line up the plastic top with the nodules on the lid for it to work correctly, I haven't had 1 problem with mine.I have with other very similar cups - it too is a Nuby and it leaks a lot.Most sippy cups in general are hard to get a lot of liquid through.As an adult I couldn't believe how hard it was to get a good "drink" of water out of most all sippy cups - this one was different, and I don't write reviews hardly ever, and I wanted to let other parents know, try this one out - for sure - and try all their current cups out and compare the difference with this one!The only down side is when you add cold liquid and it sits out on the counter for awhile- becomes room temp- the pressure in the cup pushes out the liquid from the top of the straw.Can make a sticky mess with the wrong juice, but I just try to keep it refrigerated when not in use.First I bought the Munchkin Soft-Tip Infant Spoons becuase they were the highest reated product in their catagory.I decided to buy these when I saw my sister use them with her daughter.The spoons are much bigger/deeper and and scoop more food, which is better for toddlers.The material is much softer than the Munchkin ones and feeding time is much easier with these.These utensils are a very good value.I bought them with the idea that we could take kid size utensils out to dinner and then just toss them.We have the smaller spoon size and the bigger ones for when the child is eating more on their own.I love that I don't have to feel guilty if I lose one or have to throw it away.But I have almost all of them still - probably only tossed two.I have used both the toddler flatware set and the infant spoon set, and though they are labeled Take & Toss, they do last through regular use and washing, even in the dishwasher.Since they are so cheap I don't feel bad though if I have one with me and don't have anywhere to put a dirty spoon or fork so it gets thrown out or if the dog gets one when it is thrown on the floor.The spoons are definitely a good size for a toddler and the forks are a little better than some other plastic forks we've had but not as good as the metal ones which is usually the case with plastic vs. metal.I would say that unless you are buying the full-sized crib waterproof mattress pad to protect the mattress from dustmites, I would recommend the portacrib pad.The portacrib pad is much easier to take on and off since it doesn't have the elastic corners to deal with, which means you basically have to take the mattress out of the crib to put it back on.The BEST combination would be to have your mattress, the portacrib pad, and zip sheets- Then you never have to take the mattress out of the crib to change the sheets.Would recommend to others who have sweaty little sleepers.We got them for my toddler who just transitioned to a double bed.He has pulled on the sides (much the same way he used to rattle the bars on his crib) and they stay strong.Makes for easier sheet changes.this really serves the purpose...and is very stylish as well.DD can use it as a regular backpack if I just unclip the leash.I wanted something that'll hold a few snacks for her, or maybe even her sippy cup.This is a must-have for anyone with kids.My son's feet started to reach the front seat, so I need this!Provided a quick install and good fit on the seats in my Acura TL.Very satisfied with this product and would suggest it to other parents looking to save time cleaning / fixing back seats.This is a simple product.But it works and has yet to fall off in either of our cars.In the meantime, our child has not put any mileage on the back of our seats and that is what really matter.We have one in each of our cars and are son loves to play and look at himself in the mirror.It stays put and is very adjustableWe're not using these Jumbo Mirrors for the car.We have one on their changing table and one on their play mat.They love looking at themselves in the mirror.It's one of their favorite toys.I love that it's easy to clean, all I need is a damp microfiber cloth and their little finger prints disappear.I also love that it has a hook and velcro so that I can either hang it on their activity mat, or their exersaucer, or have it standing upright on the changing table and play mat.It is super easy to clean and move around.The tray removes with only one hand and I love that it has two tray covers which easily snap on and off.the only down side so far is that the straps get covered with food and aren't also easily removed to clean them.This is well worth every penny and i have told everyone i know who's having/ had a baby about the chair.If you're looking for an easy to clean highchair, look no further.We've been using it with my daughter for a few months now and it's really a great product.The straps are fairly easy to remove (much, much easier than 99% of highchairs) to clean and smooth lines with no crevices has saved me loads of time since I'm a neat freak.Another big bonus that influenced my decision was the pedestal base...I'm a klutz and haven't stubbed a toe or tripped on this chair yet!We bought this highchair after being frustrated with the clunky, difficult-to-clean wooden highchair that we had first, and we really love the Boon Flair.The raise and lower foot button and the rolling base make this highchair very easy to adjust to different locations in the house.The entire chair is very easy to clean, and while we were concerned that the white plastic may stain with certain foods, so far it is still sparkling white.The only complaint we have is that the shoulder straps when tightened all the way are not snug for our small child, so the shoulder straps tend to fall off, but otherwise we feel that our child is very safe in this chair.This high chair is great!It's very sturdy and very easy to clean every splatter.My home is very contemporary and the highchair matches the decor so there is no need to hide it or put it away.The entire condo is tiled so I love that I can wheel the chair around to any room and the handle on the back of the chair makes it easy to move around.The tray is very easy to put on and take off and the cover is placed in a way that the child can not remove it.The fact that the chair can be set low or raised high is fantastic!Some belts practically break your fingers trying to detach them and this one comes undone with the push of a button, it's great!The only thing I don't care for and the reason I gave it four stars is that the chair has a very hard piece at the crotch to keep the baby from slipping out, which is a great feature but it needs to have a little padding or the chair needs to be able to recline even a notch because it sits very strait up and my 7 month old slides forward and it seems to put a lot of pressure on his crotch area.Weather or not is bothers him I'm not sure but padding would be nice or like I said if it could lean back just a bit it might keep smaller babies from sliding so much.The chair is very hard and not comfortable so it's great for a short play time or to have your baby sitting safely while you cook or get ready so they can be there with you or for feeding.If your looking for a chair to keep them in for a long time or to nap in then you would need a plush reclining chair.Personally, babies don't want to sit long and get bored so quickly that I think this chair is just fine.I would recommend this chair for sure.We purchased this crib to replace one that had been recalled for a drop side fix.Although this crib is well made and extremely sturdy, after placing our daughter in the crib for only a short period of time, we heard her cry out on the monitor, only to find her leg stuck between the rails.She is 4 months old and was able to roll over and get her chubby little legs stuck in the rails.I really liked this crib, but hearing her cry like that with those big baby tears and seeing how extremely well she had got caught up in the rails frightened me, so we returned it.I am not completely naive as I know these things happen and don't mean that the crib is dangerous; however, we never had any problems like this with our previous recalled crib and our toddler slept in that until she was 16 or 17 months old.For those who this doesn't deter, we had the espresso finish and it was gorgeous.You should probably know that this crib isn't one that you can slide much of anything under if you have your own storage.I received this when I was promised and was very convenient.We got this crib as a gift after we picked it out.The price is amazing, but I was worried that it wouldn't be as quality as the more expensive crib sets.I was wrong!We got it in a couple days and put it together in about 45minutes.It is so pretty, I love it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a crib!Single mom here, so I assemble everything by myself.I only had issues with one hole being out of whack and after taking a deep breath and praying about it (seriously...and I'm not even a Christian!)My 11 month old son kicks his legs a lot and would often get them caught between the railings.A simple bumper put a stop to that!The size of the crib is also a plus.I think it would be dangerous to put toys on it though.Seems like they might try to reach for them and fall out of the crib.Plus the crib is not really a place for playing, just sleeping.Covers front rail well, my son doesn't really play with the teething toys I have on it but it keeps him from putting the rail directly into his mouth so it serves its purpose.I just got this as the little one has discovered the joys of standing up in his crib.I love the Velcro where you can hang toys on the outside/inside to give them a challenge.Definitely buy this before they can stand...I hate this wet bag.The drawstring has never properly pulled closed; the rubbery PUL which makes the bag watertight sticks to the cord in the rolled-over bit which is the drawstring pocket.I would never buy again.Pretty useful to hook some toys to the dining chair.Length is just enough for baby to reach but not too long that will cause strangulation.Great for stuffed animals, sippy cups...they can throw them over the high chair or stroller...but they don't fall on the ground.They aren't very long, but that is to help prevent strangulation hazards.They're perfect for attaching toys or teething rings to the stroller, car seat handle, etc.The snap is strong enough that a baby can't undo it.They are actually made in the USA too, so that makes me feel better when the baby sticks them in her mouth.Update:  My daughter is 3 years old now, and we are still using our original set of these straps to attach her sippy cup, snack cup, etc to the stroller and car seat.Who would have thought that such an inexpensive product would be useful for so long?Only wish they were a little longer, but that won't deter me from giving them 5 stars.The length is perfect for attaching pacifiers (at least the kind with handles, like Avent) - I just put the other end through the snap or button hole on his shirts.I also love that they come two to a package, are inexpensive and come in a variety of colors.Wish I had gotten them earlier on instead of wasting money on the other straps that now just sit in a drawer.They are so handy for storing lots of diapers, creams, hand sanitizers, burp cloths, etc.Basically everything you need.Plus, they are cute!Doll and potty are a little smaller than I expected,  but that was OK.I wish the doll would actually stay in place on the potty.If you lean him against something, he sort of stays, Doll is cute though and is a nice pairing with the book.Velcro on "diaper" came loose after a bit of use.We purchased this Thermos (with the Hello Kitty design from Target) over 1 years ago.It is one of the best kids drink holders I've ever had.We actually have two, one blue one pink.They each came with an extra straw set but my originals are still going strong.I can put ice water in it in the morning and send my daughter to camp (outside, no refrigerator) and when she gets home late afternoon, there is still ice in it.We use them for lunches, travel and daily household use.Milk stays cold for up to 12 hours (although we don't usually let milk stay out that long).It has been tossed around (not dropped from any great height) and has rolled around the mini van and the only wear it shows is with the imprint on the outside.We do not wash it in the dishwasher although I think you can and I take the straw apart each time I wash it - it is a two piece part.Since we put milk in it, I often clean the straw out with a pipe cleaner so that any residual milk is removed.I use a knife point to go around the inside of the straw connecting point because this can sometimes build up some milk stuff.It sounds like a lot but it takes less than a minute to wash and I feel like it is clean when we are done.It reassembles so easily.*******************************UPDATE 9/3/2010I just purchased another Funtainer (from Amazon) so that we had one at school with cold water and one at home.Coincidentally, my daughter dropped our old one at school and the top broke.In defense of the product, she dropped it on a hard floor.I did want to point out that the one we just received from our Amazon order did not have an extra straw set but seems to be constructed like our older one.I got this knowing that it wasn't 'natural' as in ORGANIC.Has wide stretchy elastic so even if the top were to shrink a bit the elastic would still reach all the way down the sides of the mattress I'm sure.As far as being waterproof I can't quite say, but it would soak up leaks no problem since it is so fluffy (not dangerously fluffy, that would be bad for babies).Over all I'm happy with it.I'm 5'1" and weigh about 120 lbs.I have a smaller 13-month-old (he weighs about 20lbs and measures 30+ inches) and I wear him front-facing most of the time.Yesterday was the first time I went out in freezing weather (30-ish) and I wore my winter coat.Baby was pretty much in regular clothes- long sleeved-shirt, pants, socks,- and a hat.He was snug as a bug!I wish it had pockets on both sides, but it probably can't because of the zipper placement.Overall, I'm really glad I bought this and look forward to using it all winter!I hate installing car seats, period.I was cursing, sweating, and hitting things to get this thing in my car correctly.It is built like a brick house and I love it!Your child sits up high and is completely surrounded with safety features.I bought this for my three year old who thought it was funny to take the normal shoulder seat belt off while using just a booster--problem solved!Now I am going to purchase another for my 9 month old.We ordered this to replace the original seat.We've only had it for 2 days but last night my daughter fell asleep in the car, her head was well supported and she seems comfortable in the booster.The fabric is really plush and soft (like Britax/Recaro seats).However, one major improvement I noticed with this newer model from our older one is that it has significantly more cushioning.The seat, back, headrest and wings (on each side of the head rest) are significantly more padded.Think crayons, odd shells and rocks picked up at the beach, snacks, toys, etc.- SUPER EASY to use: This seat is classified as a booster, so it does not latch or any of that.It's almost dummy proof, which is great.-Armrests: This, again is something that once you're used to them, any car seat without them seems a hardship.On long drives kids want somewhere comfortable to rest their arms just as adults do.The armrests are at a great height for kids and can also be pushed up and out of the way if needed.-Cover easily comes off for cleaning: This is also great, as I've had a few car seats that removing the cover seemed like some crazy jigsaw puzzle (and even more so when trying to put them back on!)There aren't any hard to do/undo snaps, just pretty much elastic.-Rear headrest easily adjusts: You can raise or lower the headrest as needed so that it is the right height for your child or other kids who may be riding along of a different size.The wings on the headrest act like bumpers to prevent their little heads from whipping side to side during a crash or swerving.In addition, they also offer head rest support for sleeping children.When our daughter falls asleep her head is always resting on one of the side wings of the head rest.These are great seats and we love them.They fit in every car we've tried as well, whereas the Ricaro and some britax would not fit my husband's MDX.How lazy are ppl that they are complaining about cleaning two extra parts that isn't that big.My baby hasn't any colic problems and I will continue to use these bottle and for the future children as well.They keep my little one happy by preventing him from getting gas or spitting up.I've tried other bottles and always end up with a gassy baby who spits up after each feeding.I exclusively pump so every time LO eats a bottle gets dirty.lol.You can't just use the bottle and nipple without the reservoir and vent.If you try, it will definitely leak all over the place.These aren't too difficult to clean.They have a cap, nipple, neck ring, rubber "gasket", long tube, and the bottle itself.I've never had one leak when it's properly put together, and if you travel with the bottle full you do need to use the little disk to avoid spills (but that's what it's for).Basically, if you follow the directions these bottles are great.My baby burps less with these than other brands, too.Though more expensive than other brands this is worth every penny.My daughter will not use any other bottle.It has a positive pressure that keeps bubbles out of babys belly and baby and mom happy.As with most things touted as a miracle cure for your baby, the hype is a bit overblown.This bottle does help but doesn't end reflux altogether.My three-month-old daughter has had reflux issues since she was born.She's almost exclusively breastfed, except for one or two bottles a day of expressed milk.I thought I'd give the Dr. Brown's bottles a go, after feeding her from Born Free and Medela bottles with no discernible difference in her spitting up.With the Dr. Brown's bottles, we did find that she spits up slightly less.Does she still spit up?Sure -- just not quite as much.I wash these bottles in the dishwasher (top rack), and haven't had a problem with them leaking.If she were exclusively bottle-fed and I didn't have a dishwasher, I can see where these bottles might seem like a pain, but otherwise they aren't that time-consuming.A lot of the comments on the Dr. Brown's bottles seem to come down to a question of parenting style.If you're the type of parent who values convenience above all things because you're dealing with a needy baby, especially if you don't have a dishwasher, you may well dislike the Dr. Brown's bottles (my friends in this camp rave about the Playtex dropins).I breastfeed, pump and use formula.We had started with standard bottles and my daughter spit up a ton as a newborn.I'm not sure if it was these bottles or a fluke, but she seems to spit up less (she still does spit up though).I was worried about getting a bottle she would like since I'm breastfeeding, but she has been fine with these since we started them and goes back and forth between nursing and the bottles just fine.My only gripe is that it is a pain to clean all of the different pieces.They sell travel lids if you opt to pack the nipple separately.Pros:-So much fun!She loves being up high and seeing what's going on.The first day she spent about 3 hours in it!-Your kid isn't under foot when you're trying to get stuff done in the kitchen, especially dangerous things like opening the oven door and unloading breakable/sharp items from the dishwasher.-Because my daughter likes hanging out in it and can see, she's not fussing while I'm trying to work in the kitchen.She used to follow me around with her arms in the air crying "up.and now she just climbs into the tower.We're going to try putting felt or rubber on the bottom and see if that helps.-Takes a little practice learning how to get in and out of.She does great getting in, but one time when we had the platform lower she did a face plant and busted her lip.I'm sure she'll have it figured out in a couple days though.-Other reviews state that the feet stick out and can be a tripping hazard.According to the manufacturer's website those feet are optional.I got nothing done or had to listen to screaming.Now I put him in the Learning Tower, give him a wooden spoon and he just eats all the ingredients.He still screams when we wash his hands, but at least I am not trying to hold his body weight in one arm while washing with the other.(He is a handful.)On my husband's watch, he fell out of it so don't turn your back on a toddler in it.We wrapped it in bunge cords to prevent a reocurrance until he is older.Easy assembly, quick ship.You will stub your toe a few times on the legs.We would not want to live with out this.Either we didn't have the money, didn't have a kitchen, or didn't have a BIG enough kitchen to get one.They sell for practically full price used, so if we didn't like it we could resell it with little loss.We just got ours 2 days ago.Instead of just watching us in the kitchen sitting on the counter, our 2yo actually can help out.He has rinsed off dishes, made PB & J, sprinkled cheese on bread, stirred juice, beat eggs, and sorted frozen fruit.Then we took the platform out & put the included star cloth cover on top of the tower.He & his brother played for literally hours in it like that.Sure, it's pricey.It's super heavy & well made.And it grows with your child.And you can sell it for half to 3/4 what you paid new.It takes up about as much space as a regular sized table chair, so it isn't super duper huge but it is big & heavy.We put cloth sliders under ours to save our wood floors & make it easier to move.Parts are great!Based on other reviewers, we left off the side fins on the base of the feet.It comes with a really cool blue cloth with stars printed on it for extended play.I could not get the hang of using pins but that might be because I use really thick diapers on my son.We've had a few poop escapes, but nothing you wouldn't expect to see from time to time when using cloth.I use one regularly, one stays in the diaper bag... you never know!And the 3rd is a backup just in case.Much easier and faster then trying to hold a squirmy baby and pin a cloth diaper.These are a great invention to replace pins for INFANTS who aren't eating solids yet, as they allow you to get a tight enough fit at the legs to prevent the poo from getting on your diaper covers every time the baby poos.Now, if there were just a way to keep the poo from escaping out of the back (top) of the prefold onto the cover!Needless to say, we switched to Kissaluvs, then to bG OS.But I highly recommend them for anyone "trying out" cloth with their infants, you could use them for your toddler, but not absolutely necessary.If you watch a video, so easy to use.And they don't make holes in your beautiful, cute dipes!I can't even use a diaper pin and glad because I think these are so much safer.I feel like the diaper is on tighter and more secure.We are using real nappies diapers... they didn't come with any hooks or pins.For the first couple days we just used the cover to hold the cloth diaper on.Then we found out about these and I ordered them.They make it a ton easier to keep the diaper on (the cover goes on much quicker once the cloth is "clamped" in with these) and they keep the cloth tighter to avoid leaks.I would never use cloth diapers if I had to put pins in the diaper... luckily there are these things!Buy some today if you don't have them!I got pins as well.In theory these are a great idea, but I found they gave a super tight fit and didn't hold the layers together well - like the inner portion of the diaper kept slipping.It's really not hard at all once you do it for the first time - pinch the dipe away fropm the baby, slide the pin through your hair to make it slippery, and pin.:-)  If I had it to do over, I wouldn't buy them, though they did serve some use early on.These little gadgets make cloth diapering with prefolds or flats so much easier.Changing a diaper using one of these is just as quick as changing a disposable once you get the hang of it.They are sharper than you would expect.They always seemed so soft and benign, until one day I caught the teeth on my finger during a diaper change- Ouch!It bled.I do not recommend these for toddlers.At 7 months old, she can easily unfasten a Snappi, as well as the velcro diaper covers, so we just have a rule in the house that she must ALWAYS have shorts or bloomers over her diaper.I don't believe this is at all a flaw in the product, I just have a very mischievous, bright little girl.It keeps the stink in!When the pail is almost full, it does start smelling a bit, but only if you're close to it can you smell anything.Also, the quick second it takes to put the diaper in the pail, you might get a wiff of the contents, but that's to be expected.I was delighted to discover that I could put trash bags in this system instead of the expensive refills!Yay!Love the bib itself since it wears well and it's organic.Gave it 4 stars because they kept sending me the blue instead of the pink that I ordered.I thought it was just a mix-up the first time so didn't think much of it and I don't mind that my baby girl wears blue.Ordered 2 more because the bib itself is so great.They sent me 2 blue ones again instead of the pink.Were they out of the pink?I didn't bother sending back since the shipping from Hawaii would cost more than the items themselves.Our family has never been disappointed with any of their products.We've bought several different brands on Amazon such as I-Play, Green Sprouts, BabySoy, and even other Under The Nile bibs.Considered giving four instead of five stars due to the price-- they're expensive-- but figure you get what you pay for.Our little girl wears this bib A LOT-- and not just at meals!She insisted on wearing it to the grocery store!She is getting too big to use it in the crib now (scared she will stand up and pull it down) so I'm trying to figure out a way to attach it to her changing table.I bought this to go with a moses basket I ordered at the same time here on amazon (Burlington Baby Moses Basket with Gingham Liner, Sage/White(mine is pink)and the fit is pretty well..its a tiny bit larger than the basket but its stable in there and I dont see it being a problem in any way!i can also squeeze my valco baby buggster stroller bassinet (one of the largest stroller bassinets i have ever seen) in this stand very snugly, I just have to kind of reshape the plastic support right after I take it out and its fine :) Also the rocking motion is pretty smooth/gentle, the screws are not even close to sticking out to make it bumpy like a review I read on one of these brand stands :) I also put it together in about 20min by myself (well my children were "helping" haha.The Burlington Baby basket fits well into it, and it has room for a longer one than that.Step 2 has you screw things in, and then step 3 tells you how those pieces were supposed to be oriented... if you didn't already do it right by accident, you have to unscrew them and start over.Still, 5 stars as a product; just take this into consideration as you're assembling it!I bought 2 inexpensive crib sheets and she uses her favorite blanket and little pillow and sleeps through the night.The material is sturdy and I like that you can put a sheet on it and tuck it in.The plug-in pump is a great bonus and we have used it for other things around the house (including pump up our large inflatable kayaks!).We have a battery operated pump from another air mattress that we can use when we go camping.Worth the money.Glad to know that this air mattress is phthalate free...but it still wreaks!Has a heavy plastic/PVC smell that reflects off-gassing of some sort of chemical.Would recommend inflating and airing out the mattress for several days before use.Also wish the air pump was incorporated into the mattress like Aerobeds.You have to hold the pump up to the opening and make sure it's sealed to pump up the mattress--although it's quick.Still, it would have been more convenient and space saving had the pump already been part of the mattress.I had a couple of surprises, but nothing major.First, the mattress and the sides are all connected - I was under the impression that I could take the mattress out and use it separately if I needed the space.Also, the mattress is toddler bed length and width, but a bit shorter in height - the toddler sheets fit, but a bit loosely.Should be nice to have for his friends that spend the night too, since we've usually just done a pile of blankets on the floor for them in the past.The included air pump worked FAST, and was compact and easy to use.A happy bonus since we've been blowing up our regular air mattresses with a blow dryer when we need them.Problem solved!Now he comes up with other excuses for delaying bedtime, but dark is not one of them!I like that it has batteries and we don't have a charger taking up space on the nightstand.I would purchase this again, and will when my toddler needs one.Doesn't get hot.I use it in my baby's room when I'm feeding her at night.Going to buy another one for my boys' room.Comfortable, easy to clean, easy to use and folds easy to store.I love the soft leather feel (though not of real leather) of this high chair.I've spilled a wee bit of milk on it, and it was easy to clean off.My daughter used to make a face/squealed when I set her in the chair b/c the leather was cold to the touch, but I solved that problem by placing a piece of sheepskin on it (It's still narrow enough for me to use the harness).However, the existing recline is okay for my 1-year-old daughter who has reflux.It's convenient to have her in this chair for her feeds/post feed-time period.Overall, I like this high chair very much and would recommend it.***Update after a few months of use***I still like this chair, but it is a PAIN to clean!Wiping down the plastic parts/tray is easy enough, but the nooks and crannies of the buckles make it very difficult to clean the straps, especially where milk and pudding have dried.I wiped everything dry and lay it on its side to get the water to drain from the unreachable parts.The leather cover was washed down too.I just noticed that the stitching on the cover's right side had been badly done.The right side's leather was sewn "sticking out"...This does not detract from the function of the high chair, of course, but it does raise my brow, seeing as Peg Perego usually has top quality craftsmanship.Maybe this chair was on the defective list, but it had not been listed as such.In any case, the high chair serves its purpose well, and my daughter gets to have the occasional post-meal nap in the reclined mode.You can turn off the monitor but you can't turn off the sound.I wish i could just watch the monitor esp when my son is crying since i can hear him despite the volume..we have a small house.The other monitors on the market are definitely more expensive and I don't know for how long I will need this monitor since my son is getting old enough for me not to need it very often.soo...this will serve its purpose.___________________________________________________________I bought this monitor based on my friends recommendation and I did not read any amazon reviews first...i probably would have been scared off.So far i've been using this monitor for a few days and it has worked as designed and advertised.Two things I would have preferred:1)the volume control i wish could go lower.If you have a sound machine on in the baby's room there is no way to make the monitor's volume really low.2) it came with a rechargeable battery pack.The camera takes  AA and the monitor takes 6.my cell phone does not interfere.3) has an Auto on mode so you can set it and the monitor will not come on unless there is noise from the baby.(although you can't use this function if you have a noise machine in their room.)4) you can turn off the video part and just have it function as a regular monitor if you wish.Nice feature if the monitor is next to your bed at night.I just turn on the video if i hear my son cry out to see what the situation is before i go in.5)the picture is a good size.I've seen some monitors that are really small.Hopefully it continues to work well!Unfortunately I purchased this after my daughter was already eating more than 2 ounces... so the small 'vial-type' bottles went unused.However, the extra bottles/lids/nipples, and the freezer bags were a necessity!Okay, so this is the FIRST and ONLY trainer cup that my 10.5 month old son will actually take expressed milk or formula from-- we have been through more types of sippy and straw cups than I care to count at this point (over 15).Despite my excitement about this, I will attempt to not let it taint my review.To give this product a fair appraisal, I must mention that the spouts are VERY much like a bottle nipple.If you have ever tried Nubys, the "spout" is almost identical in feel/composition, but the shape is a big departure (my son didn't like the Nuby products)-- the closest thing I could compare to in shape is the Born Free trainer spouts (again, no success with those for milk).Now, if like me, you are a self-professed sippy cup expert, to the point of drinking out of one yourself all day to model the "correct" behavior, the baby in you will appreciate that there is no great effort necessary to get the liquid from the bottle.I have noticed several other people describe the same thing-- I think this is the price you pay for fewer parts-- my son doesn't seem to mind *too* much, so I am more than willing to live with it.I should also note that before purchasing ([...]-- less expensive for bottles), I wrote to the company with questions and did not receive a reply until 6 days later-- too long by my standards, and coincidentally?about the same exact time this review appeared on Amazon (I am presently editing to reflect that I did indeed receive a reply).:(The bottle cap "squishes" the spout/nipple on the conversion kit-- does not seem to affect their present function, but possibly in the long-term?I have since ordered more from Amazon, based on the shipping vs. total cost tradeoff.Although this is the first sippy that my son has really taken to, I can only give it 4 stars.Now on to the abbreviated list of good and bad.PRO:LightweightEasy to cleanFew parts (it doesn't get much more basic-- I like that)VIRTUALLY leak-proofSimilar to bottle nipple (also in my list of cons)Easy flowAttractive designCON:MINOR drips/leakageSimilar to bottle nipple (I'd like to have my son use a "real" sippy in the near future)Collapsing spoutCap "squishes" spout when secured on for travelKeeps the milk in and doesn't leak.I thought this was cute.It doesn't have a lot of special stickers and things like that, but I liked it.It does the job-- there are spaces to write about the same set of issues (sleeping and feeding patterns, favorite games, songs, etc.)every month, plus room to jot down blurbs each day.But the design is quite bland.I'm keeping it on a counter in the baby's room and using it like a journal rather than bothering to display it on the wall.The current price from this seller of nearly $20 is totally ridiculous; we bought it in a store for a fraction of that.Although the cups that advertise as "spill-free" may be convenient for parents in that kids can go all over, including with grape juice on a couch, and not spill, but it's not really teaching the child any skill beyond a bottle.With this cup, there's a spout and the child has to tilt the cup back and water dribbles out of the spout without any sucking needed.So the child learns how to tilt and drink as if from a cup, but without the mess.Turned upside down, water can and does dribble out.Inconvient as such but that's the tradeoff.He's always liked his baths, but sometimes tearing him away from his other toys was hard.They float, they're soft, and they stick to the sides of the tub when wet  They come with a mesh bag to keep them collected, and it has a couple of loops on it so it's easy to hang it from a hook in the bathroom to dry each night.My 14 month old son was getting bored by his bath toys so I decided it was time for new ones.I read the reviews for this product and decided to go for it.He sits in the bath and builds and builds.The only issue that I have is that the floating platform moves around a lot (of course) and it is hard for my son to sit in one place and build.He scoots around trying to corral the platform and blocks.As he gets older though, this problem will rectify itself.I tried every nursing pillow out there.I had settled on the "Brest Friend", but found it so difficult to put it on every time with a screaming hungry baby in one hand.It is firm, tall (at least 6") and flat across, but curved on the side to facilitate a closer fit.The duck is very cute and my baby likes the colors.Also it is easy for her to grab and she likes to feel it.I like that the wings and feet are weighted so that it stays in place better.The only down side is that it is cumbersome when she is upset and I am trying to get her to take her pacifier.I love this bottle and its 8oz friend.I used it for my first child for over a year for pumped breastmilk while I worked full time and am now using the same bottles for my second.The bottles are all as good as new.I pump directly into the bottles with my Medela pump, freeze in the bottles, even warm bottles with a First Years bottle warmer that steams to warm (although the manufacturer does not recommend this, it has never been a problem).I know there are a bajillion bottles to choose from to feed a baby, but there must be a reason this bottle is still around.Not to mention priced appropriately.Why not stick with the classic?It's always fun to write a review on those products that not only worked out great but also were a smashing value, to boot.Sure, I may spend more time with my power tools than baby bottles, but I quickly grew fond of feeding my baby daughter and I always appreciate a super product at a great value.Also, I figure there ought to be some positive side to my initial, terrifying, experience to shopping for feeding supplies.It was my mission, you see, to get the bottles and accessories necessary for feeding baby when mommy went back to work.(baby was breastfed and went to the bottle for pumped milk...)  No problem, I thought.Go to the store, grab some bottles and be home in 20 minutes, I thought.Whoa.First time parents, you know what I am talking about:  go into one of those giant baby supply stores and behold the section labeled 'feeding' and there it is - a wall 8 feet high by  40 feet long.(seemed like 100 feet long at the time)  Shelves and shelves and shelves of JUST bottles, and we're not even talking about nipples.My wife thought I had instead gone to a bar when I finally got home 4 hours later, exhausted and overwhelmed.With no bottles.OK, so the review...We wanted bottles with no BPA, which was beginning to make big news a few years ago, so we explored non-BPA options.There were plastic ones, but not all of them indicated on the bottle exactly what type of plastic they were.(you know, PETE, HDPE, LDPE, etc.with those little triangles on the bottom)  That made me unsure of plastic.Would they break?So, these glass bottles have no BPA.Another nice benefit is that they also have no printing, so we don't have to worry about what chemicals or heavy metals might also be in the printing.And, another nice thing about not having any printing is that the printing doesn't wear off after hundreds of feedings and cleanings.Which is never.They are colorless.You can see what's in the bottle, and you can also tell when they are clean.I mean, there's nothing so clean looking as clear glass with no water spots, right?We've seen other plastic bottles that were colored or turned cloudy over time, and I don't like not seeing exactly what my baby is drinking.They are durable.Unless you clean them with steel wool, these bottles won't scratch.Can't say that about plastic.They also won't melt, either, when you boil them to sterilize.BPA-free plastic may be great when it is cold, but I wondered what chemicals they may be releasing at over 212 degrees.Any glass is breakable, but our daughter didn't break a single one in almost two years.(car windows, house windows, drinking glasses, dishes, etc.)When baby turned to toddler, however, the deal's off, as she likes nothing better than to hurl everything she can hold.You've seen other glass bottles, the ones that ape the 'no BPA' angle, the ones that cost nearly TEN bucks for a measly TWO bottles?Yikes!I looked at them, and they're fine bottles, but we're talking value here and these Evenflo bottles win that argument, for me.Besides, I recall that these bottles came not only with a ring and nipple, but also a top cap, and a seal that goes under the ring so you can shake up formula without spewing it all over the place through the nipple.(ask me how I know)Other nice things:  These come in common-sense sizes, 4 and 8 ounces.Also, they happen to fit perfectly Medela breast pump valves - for those of you so inclined - so you can pump directly into the bottle and then pop it in the fridge.No gas, no fussiness, no issues at all with the nipples, which do vent.Evenflo classic glass bottles fit the Medela pumps, so you can pump directly into glass bottles and not the plastic.It also fits the Lansinoh hand pump, but Lansinoh pump does not compare to the hospital-grade $1800 Medela pump.Glass doesn't leach chemicals and acts as a perfect storage container for breast milk.When I told my friends I wanted to get glass bottles, everyone warned me against them by arguing that glass breaks.Well I got them anyway, and I am very glad I did.The reason I wanted glass is because I just dont trust plastic, even BPA free.And the glass on these bottles is very durable.I have dropped bottles multiple times on hardwood floor and never once has a bottle broke.It adjusts to the baby sucking.The nipple is still not too fast and not too slow.In comparison, we have gone through 3 sizes of Dr.Brown nipples as each size soon enough becomes too slow.Just make sure you tighten the cap thoroughly, as otherwise I find some milk leaks out.But if everything is tightened, then everything works as designed.When I was researching which bottles were best for our new babe I thought I wanted Dr. Brown's-- they looked very modern and state-of-the-art... however, they are pretty pricey and have all of the parts to rinse and clean (and lose).Our little one like to shake the bottle to see if the formula shoots out to make a wonderful mess, but these don't leak.They are easily cleaned in the washer and have withstood quite a few falls into our sink-- so they are durable.I would say, try these and see what you think; you might not need to get more "advanced" bottle systems than these economical and convenient bottles.I don't use these for feeding, but I love them for use with my Medela Pump in Style.I pack two in a insulated lunch bag with an icepack every day.Some days I get more milk than others so I like having the larger bottles so I don't have to change out mid way through a session.A true classic, you can't go wrong with these.When they leaked constantly, I finally decided to throw in the towel and find another solution.They are all of those things, mostly, but they have a few of their own flaws.The obvious being that glass bottles are heavy and I worried often that they would break or shatter.The glass is thick enough that they probably won't break, but heavy enough that I was terrified of accidentally dropping it on my foot (anything can happen when a baby is in arms).The next problem was that the opening to the bottle is quite narrow.The narrow opening also made it difficulty to dump formula powder inside.the formula containers I had barely fit in the opening, as was the case with the formula scoop.It made for a number of messes.The third problem with this classic design was that there is no venting system.The nipples would always collapse as my daughter sucked on them, and when I pulled the nipples out of her mouth, they were flat and would suck in all the air to refill and un-flatten.I worried about the amount of air she was taking in, and the lack of formula from the collapsed nipples.All in all, I give these bottles a 3-star rating, but I kept going back and forth between 2 and 3 stars.These bottles are affordable and they don't leak.That's about it - they are adequate, at best.I have since thrown these away in favor of the Dr. Browns bottles.I don't have time for a product that makes my life more complicated at every feeding, which the Evenflo Classic bottles did.This is one of those products that you just love to write a review for:  It's top quality and a huge value.My wife, daughter, and I used these and the 4 oz.models through countless cycles and they rock...Pros+  It's just glass - no BPA, no odors, no clouding, no scratches.+  Easy to clean - they won't melt and they won't scratch with frequent cleaning.(don't use steel wool, of course)+  They come with nipples, rings, and caps.Nice!+  The threads match Medela breast pump valve threads.One thing I really like about the bottles is that they are clear, with gradations molded into the glass itself.This means no printed markings to obscure your view into the bottle, nothing to wear off, and no worries about what chemicals or heavy metals may be in the paint.Also, we've never broken one in nearly two years of constant use and cleanings.Cons-  For those who are terrified of broken glass, well, these will probably break if you drop them on a hard surface.Our experienceOur daughter used these through many, many cycles, first with the four ounce models and then with these as her appetite grew.She was breastfed and transitioned to pumped milk when mommy went back to work.Our daughter had no issues with the nipples whatsoever, even when breast and bottle both were in the picture.The silicone nipples are vented via a shallow groove at their base - twist the ring on too tight and the venting isn't effective, causing the nipple to collapse; too loose and it will leak.They worked well and baby had no issues with gas or fussiness.The bottles worked equally well with formula, while on the breast pump apparatus, and moving from the fridge to the bottle warmer.You can tell when they are clean, unlike many - if not most - plastic bottles that are either printed on or colored, and that scratch or cloud over time; When we packed them away after our first child stopped using them, they looked like new!In thousands of feedings and cleanings, we never broke a single one.At home, however, our daughter drinks from a Tilty.After finally realizing that there is no sippy cup out there that is truly leakproof AND not increadibly hard to suck from, I tried this cup for my 8 month old baby, and it is great.No valve (so it will leak, but not a lot), only 2 simple parts to clean, love the tilted bottom that allows baby to drink without bending backward too much.And the additional hole-less cap for traveling is so handy.It is not a training cup (Playtex Sipster is great for that) because it doesn't have a soft spout that eases the transtion from the bottle and no handles.In terms of the leaking, that is in my opinion a non issue when babies are only allowed to drink where they should and under supervision, not allowed to throw things etc...good table manners shoud start young!I really like this sippy for my two and a half year old!Pros:transparent, so you can see what's inside and how much is left without opening itappears to be easy to use, less cup/head tilting needed to get out all the liquidEASY to clean and disassemble/assemble, so few parts (just 2), dishwasher safeif knocked over or turned upside down, it does leak, but really not very muchinexpensiveBPA freeCons:does leak more than a properly assembled and functioning Foogo (although overall we like this one FAR better)probably not appropriate for toddlers just coming off a bottle or who are still throwing their cup, etctends to attract dishwasher soap residue (i do use a powered soap, so this may be the issue)lid can be very difficult to remove at first, but this improves with usedesign does cause quite a bit of water to be left around cup rim after going through dishwasher, so hand drying is always neededOverall, I definitely recommend this cupIf the Tilty cup came with soft tips and handles, this cup would be perfect.Leak proof sippies are essentially glorified bottles.And bad for babies' teeth.I like that he doesn't have to break is neck to get a drink.The two end pieces come pre-assembled- there were visible gaps where the cross bars joined the legs.The large side cross bars are joined by a screw and a plastic dowel.I had two of the plastic dowels snap before I gave up.Mine came with all the pieces and was fairly easy to assemble.I'm not sure what other reviewers had troubles with before but maybe they've just made it better recently.All your supplies are easily within reach.Once you get it assembled, it works like a dream.The first night back from the hospital with baby and the audio stopped working middle of the night so I woke up to my baby screaming across the hall as we clearly had not heard her earlier cues since the audio had stopped working.It basically went in and out of sound.In addition the monitor had permanent static.I assumed this would be a standard problem with all monitors but we subsequently purchased the Summer and it works perfectly and has a better picture...If the answer is yes, then you are better off going with this one.If not, Summer Infant might be adequate.The reason being digital vs analog.This device is digital so nobody will pick up your signal.Even at night, I can clearly see what my baby is doing.We usually leave Vox on all night.Another nice thing is that if you have the soothing toy nearby that makes sound, like the music played by her mobile and the sleep sheep's sound, it won't trigger it.Battery life is somewhat decent.I had it on Vox without plugging in all night, the handheld device is still going in the morning4.I love the camera setting.It's a magnetic base so you simple put the ball shaped monitor on top of it and rotate around to adjust the angel.It also has an adapter to hook it up on any crib.No screw required5.you can remotely turn on the music played by the monitor by using the handheld.Static noise can drive you crazy if you keep the picture on all time.Because it's so loud, the static usually is the sound to wake me up, not the baby's cry next door, so I can't say it's all bad2.The sound of it is OK.It's not too crystal clear.Sometimes I can't tell if the baby is crying or just cooing to herself3.This is the biggest drawback as a digital device: when this thing is on, it shuts down our Netbook's wireless receiver.However, it does not bother our full size laptop nor the Mac mini, just the stupid netbook.Over all, it's a great little device.I won't pay $300 for it, but for little less than $150, it's worth every penny.This monitor is an acceptable device for our needs.The screen could stand to dim more for night time use in our bedroom, it's at least as bright as a night light & usually right next to your face, so that could be a problem for some people.The VOX option doesn't turn on at quiet enough noises, so we don't bother with it.The battery life after 8 months of use is still +4 hours.About half of the time, this is due to an actual noise.It's durable, I drop it weekly & though the antenna cover broke once, I was able to fit it back on without it continuing to fall off all the time.I can still be two floors away & have a good signal but more than 15 feet outside of our house & I lose it.I used to be able to go further out into our yard.Really though, this is a good product, like I said, for the money.I'll buy another one if someone would tell me if two can run in the same house without interfering with each other.After buying a Summer brand monitor which was HORRENDOUS (and I got video of another baby in the building- creepy), I bought this one.I am happy to say that we have been using it with no problems since the beginning.This was super easy to set up and it was all pretty much self explanatory.Our "baby" is 20 months old so I don't use it all the time, just when I want to check in before bed or to see when she wakes in the morning.I would definitely recommend this product.I bought this product first because 1) price 2) lullaby 3) supposed to be interference free.Then I bought summer infant best view 2.5' display one for my mom's house.only good things about this monitor was the lullaby, which I didn't really need because I had electronic mobile.even with the lights on.the sound is delay.and it cuts off and on.really junk.it's like listening to broken radio.the summer infant best view has 1) clear image 2) good sounds , 3) interference free, 4) zoom up and 5) controllable monitor.it's really convenient to be able to use the monitor handset to zoom up and control the monitor.so when your baby is sleeping and turning, you can make sure that he has good airway.and when he wakes up and go into the corner of the crib, you can control the monitor on the handset to find him without going into the room.I hope this info was helpful...although the bestview's image goes on sleep mode automatically (and you can wake it up by just pressing one big button), I still think that one is alot better than the levana.We have used this product every day, for 5 1/2 months now.We have had no problems at all!It has not had any interference or sound problems.Great product, and have recommended to friends.I like the video quality and the sound quality is good so long as baby is loud enough (even hear his toots when they're loud enough :) ...)Others complained about the red 'on' light on the front of the transmitter 'eye'.I taped a piece of white paper over it to soften it.It doesn't serve any real function so I felt fine doing that.The clamp base for the transmitter works well on the co-sleeper, but the portion that allows for angling the 'eye' is a little sensitive to being bumped out of position.Back to the wi-fi.When the receiver is next to my computer and I'm accessing our network (other computers or storage devices) the thing acts up by showing 'out of range'.This doesn't happen with simple internet use and happens at no other place in the house.It does seem to happen more when the receiver isn't plugged in, but for sure it's not playing nice with the signal from my computer to our storage device.Overall, I'm pleased with the product and wouldn't hesitate recommending it.Good picture.Cons:1.Cannot be wall mounted, so unless you use the attached bracket to mount it to the side of the crib (which is only useful if the baby can't sit up) you'd better have a table for it to stand on.2.The angle created by placing it on a table nearby cuts off half of the baby view.It won't mount properly to a co-sleeper.3.The handheld unit has a rechargeable battery only; there's no place to put regular batteries -  so you can't travel with it if you are going somewhere without electricity (like camping).4.This unit has really poor reception between the camera and the handheld part.This is my 6th video baby monitor and the only one that I've ever had this problem with.5.The volume level is really low - I can only hear the baby if the volume is all the way up AND there's no other extraneous apartment noise (i.e.tv, AC, even conversation!The volume sound is very echo-ey.Conclusion: While there is no perfect video monitor, this is by far the worst one I've gotten.I could live with all the cons as long as the signal didn't constantly drop out, but what good is a monitor that doesn't monitor the bAby consistently?For the past two years, I've been using the Bebe Sounds Angel Care Monitor, which I love.Was it from drinking the sippy cup of water he has in his room at night while lying down, or was he sick (turns out, it's allergies), but I wanted to know.After much research and review reading, I chose this monitor.I don't hate it, but I certainly don't love it.It doesn't stay on all the time.This really threw me off since, with a traditional monitor, you can always hear what's going on in babys room.With the Levana, when you turn the unit on, the sound comes on initially, then cuts out.It'll only come back on if the speaker on the camera detects a sound in the room (like baby crying or coughing).I actually thought I had a faulty unit till I read the other reviews.Strike two came the second morning of using it.He usually plays quietly in his room for about an hour before he's ready to start his day.I turned on the video monitor, and the screen was completely white.I tried everything...took the battery out, plugged it into the wall, turned it on and off a million times.Since I knew what he was doing in his room, I just plugged it into the charge (which it didn't need since I hadn't had it on all night) and let it be.And hour later I turned it back on and it worked fine.It did that TWO mornings in a row.It serves MY purpose, which was just to have a back-up monitor with a camera, but I still feel the need to keep my original monitor plugged in.New parents...save yourself the trouble.Before you purchase this product, please look at the updates other reviewers have added to their initial review.I was coming back to update my review, but realized the review I'd written was actually for the monitor I'd purchased to replace this one.At first, this video baby monitor was awesome.My wife and I would bring the monitor upstairs so that we could watch television for a little while before we went to bed, and we always ended up just watching our son over the monitor instead.The night vision was not bad for low-light, and when our son took daytime naps, the color picture was very good.The sound was good quality, and we liked that we could turn a few lullabyes on and off from upstairs.The range was also very good.But.When we went to visit some family about two and a half months after buying the monitor, we set it up and I realized about half an hour later that the picture looked as if it hadn't changed at all.I went to go check on my son (the room we were stayign in was on the other side of the house), and he was crying miserably.You'd never know by the picture frozen on the screen!We tried repeatedly to use the monitor after that day, but it never worked well again.After reading several other reviews here, it seems as if the same thing happened to several other consumers.We were (and remain) very disappointed with the product.I give the BABYVIEW20 two stars, but only because it has such great potential; it worked great at first.But in no way would I recommend anyone purchasing this product.It's just poor quality, and is now a baby toy for my 16-month old.My husband and I were originally going to settle for an audio monitor, but then a friend of mine showed me hers and I realized how neat and useful they were.My friend has the Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor, but while I was shopping, I saw that this one has more features and doesn't cost that much more.The screen is big and decent.The volume is more than loud enough and crystal clear and without interference.At first I wasn't sure I'd like it because I wanted to keep the sound on and just turn on/off the video at will like my friend's video monitor, but now I'm glad the whole parent unit shuts off unless the baby makes a noise.I like the music feature, but don't like the fact that the sound and video on the parent unit stays on if you turn the music in the camera on.I know once he starts to pull himself up I will have to move the camera altogether or else he will be able to mess with it.It comes with a magnetic base that allows the camera to be manually turned and tilted for a better view, but no wall mount which would give the optimal view so I will have to put it on his dresser next to the crib.The camera doesn't pan or zoom.You also can't control the nightlight feature from the parent unit.None of the negative aspects of this baby monitor warrant losing a star in my opinion because you will not find a video monitor that has it all in this price range.Overall, it does what it claims and does it well.I highly recommend this video monitor to everyone.I absolutely love this monitor!It makes nap and night time so much easier as i can now "see" my baby when she is making noise...it really helps prevent me waking her up when all she is doing is making noises in her sleep.I would highly recommend this monitor.I don't understand some of them.They say this isn't the seat found at BRU, but I don't know what they are talking about unless they are confused between the child convertible seat and booster seat.At the time it had only been used forward facing and we had no installation difficulties.This way we'd have one for our two vehicles.It took us FOREVER to figure out how to install it properly in our small CRV rear-facing.The base is not necessary and it makes it a ton easier to install in smaller vehicles when you take it off.So after three tries and a couple hours later we had it installed.For our sakes we purchased this seat again (from Amazon), Triton pattern, and it took us all of 5 minutes to install now that we are seasoned pros and knew to take the base off for rear-facing installation.We then turned our daughter forward facing at the same time, we also removed the base from her seat and it made it a better fit in our CRV.I returned it with no problems.I always like to check reviews first before buying any product.And there are always the bad reviews that stick out and I always wonder if the product is ACTUALLY a bad product or if the people that posted them are...well, you know!!!I loved this car seat from the beginning and just decided to bite the bullet and get it.I couldn't be happier with my decision right now.I read some reviews saying that it is heavy and bulky.It has the perfect amount of bulk to keep my baby safe, and ultimately, isn't that the reason they are in it to begin with!And a bunch of people said it was too big to fit in their car.I have one of the smallest cars on the planet(2 door Saturn Coupe) and it fits fine in my backseat.And also, I read some reviews that stated how the directions were unclear.That's a load...there is step by step directions for everything that you could possibly do with this car seat.I love the arm rests and cup holder, and I love that you can adjust the height of the head part without taking the car seat out.So overall, I am extremely pleased that I didn't let a few bad reviews stop me.My two year old told me he likes his new car seat better than his old one, because it has a very plush pillow that he says is "Very soft, Mommy"!!So from the point of the kid sitting in the car seat...this was a GREAT buy!!Everytime I pull them out she squeals and I flip through and say the name of the letter, and trace her finger over it and talk about the animal.Granted, we only get to about the letter "G" before she loses attention and wants to chew on them.They are not very chew-friendly, of course, since it's laminated paper really, so I don't ever just hand them to her.I love that there are unique animals that correspond to the letters, not the typical "A is for apple" stuff.Great buy, and great price.These flash toys are great but some of the items are a little obscure (x is for x-ray fish?)The actual edges for each flash card is borderline sharp almost to the point where I might be afraid of a papercut.This is a great product for the price.The card stock feels a little flimsy but is more durable than it appears.These certainly are not the greatest flash cards out there (for those, look to the DK Publishing Touch and Feel Cards).But this is a great product for car rides.And they love the handle.My 14 month old son likes these flash cards.It is a good distraction for car rides.When I ordered it, I thought the pages were plastic but they are not.They are laminated card stock and can get easily bent and wet when they put them in their mouth.the handle is durable and he likes to chew on it...The padding isn't the thickest, it probably shouldn't be anyway, but it does provide a little bit of cushion for the boys.It fits very snugly over the crib/toddler mattresses - as it should.I change the twins' sheets if they spit up, and thus far the pad has released any potential stains.Out of the six we have received, none of them have arrived with any sort of strong odor, and none of them have shrunk when washed and dried in the washer and dryer.I don't believe there's much better out there for the same amount of money.They eventually wear out at the corners, but not after being heavily washed and used for a while - over a year each.I've washed and dried this pad on regular settings with no problems.No pilling thus far, I've had it about 5 months.It fits the mattress well, and if anything, makes the baby more comfy as an extra littler layer of cushion between the sheet and mattress.Great buy!The only problem I had is that it was a bit difficult to get on the crib mattress.Not sure how long the seams will last.All in all, a good product so far, I'll update in a few months when I see how well they hold up.This is a great cover and much higher quality than the cheap one I picked up at Babies R Us!The fabric on the sides seems strong enough.Very snug.I use this with my Safety 1st Onboard Infant Car seat.I can pull the car seat out of the car and be ready to go in probably less than two minutes.I like this car seat carrier a lot - a very good buy.This product has worked better than expected, based on the reviews.Installation is simple and if followed, the product works well.In for another for the back door.We purchased the ProGrade Lever Lock and were extremely disappointed in it.From the time we bought it, we were unhappy with it's bulky, unattractive design but it was the only thing available at the store so we decided to get it anyway.Installation was not flawless, it hardly worked with our lever door handles as you could still push the handle enough to open the door.We worked around this and installed the lock lower around the door handle so that at least our son would not be able to push down on the lever and open the door and he had yet to figure out he could push the handle up.After a few weeks of installing it, my 12 month old son was able to remove the entire safety lock from the door, making it completely useless.On top of all of this, the tape took the paint off of the door.Very disappointed....horrible product.Would not recommend!My boy's only 6 weeks old and hasn't really gotten a "grasp" of holding onto things yet, but when we gave it to him, he seemed to really like it.I think as he gets a little older, he'll be able to hold onto the puppy better, but we think it was good for him to get a headstart and start holding onto it now.Even when it falls out of his mouth, I like the fact that it doesn't go very far.Sometimes he has a tendency to spit out his pacifier pretty far!My only dislike is that you can't detach it (like with the Paci Plushies) so you could wash them separately.My son loves to teeth with this Wub and also likes to snuggle and play with the stuffed animal part.A great, great buy and we have three different Wubs!This one is really cute and one of our favorites.He only wanted to chew on them.One day I caught him with practically a whole soothie pacifier in his mouth.It terrified me, so I purchased this, knowing he couldn't choke on it.He will usually chew on it, but when he's tired, he will also suck on it.I really recommend it!I feel that this was a great mattress for the money.I looked around alot and Amazon.com had the best price and free shipping.It is firm with out being too hard, several different brands of crib sheets fit well.As a newcomer in U.S., my wife and I was very worried about my baby's health.For the last two weeks, she had to sleep on the carpeted floor.And my wife and I am fully satisfied with that.My baby is only 6 months old, so he can't tell me if he likes it.I try to follow "the rules" when it comes to baby safety stuff and I know that you're supposed to get a firm mattress.Some people have written that this is too soft, but I don't think it's too soft at all.It seems to be firm to me.When I was deciding what mattress to use with the DaVinci Emily II Convertible Crib I purchased, I decided I would mainly focus on the big three (Serta, Sealy and Simmons) plus DaVinci themselves.I looked at many mattresses that were priced around $150 and more, like the Simmons BeautyRest line, but then Amazon threw a HUGE sale on this mattress...lowering it from around $140 to $97!I immediately researched it everywhere including the Sealy website and then decided this was a STEAL!This mattress comes with a LIFETIME warranty!That is ALL that matters.Based on the description and the coil count I was expecting the mattress to be more firm than it is.But overall it's a good mattress.It's certainly not soft.Our son has been sleeping on it for the past 4 months and he seems to sleep well.The waterproof material is nice, but it makes the sheets slide, so we put a waterproof mattress pad under the fitted sheet.I purchased only one of these cups and at first I thought it's kind of expensive.Do I really need to have my child have something that keeps drinks cold?The answer is yes, when it comes to milk I am glad I got this cup!It keeps the milk fresher longer and works well.At 12 months old he would drop it due to the weight but now at 15 months old he tends to hold it much better.I also purchased the playtex sippy cups too around the same time.The playtex ones looks used and worn out already after only three months of use.They were easier for my child to hold at 12 months and he didn't drop them on the ground.To be honest the lid is kind of like a bottls lid and is good if your sticking the cup back into the fridge but other than that there is no reason to give the lid to a child.Overall, I plan on purchasing more of these sippy cups at least 7 and use the playtex ones for running around in so if I lose one I am not loosing a fortune along with it.I got this pump last year when my daughter was first born.The pump worked great.Not to mention it was terribly loud.I did like the fact that it was very portable and had a battery pack so I could pump in the car.I just switched to the Medela Swing which seems to be working great and is less noisy.I researched long before purchasing a expensive but necessary breastpump, I wasn't sure if I should buy this one, because of some of the reviews posted here but I'm glad I did, this was a God send, it wasnt harsh on breasts and I got in 10 minutes triple the amount of breastmilk I got with a Medela.I really hated medela, it broke fast, and it did nothing for me.I think when it comes to comfort and effectiveness of breastpumps it depends on each person, I read horrible reviews of this one, but it did wonders for me and my daughter.Wife is getting good output and it's easy enough to setup and get going.The parts and pump seem solidly made and durable.My wife has yet to return to work but this will make it a little easier.One thing I didn't appreciate as a rookie and am still trying to figure out...there are no storage bags for this unit.Instead Avent sell containers that are easy to use(quick switching between cap and nipple top) but can only be used three times (according to babiesrus lady) and then need to be tossed.Pumping directly into a bag is desirable to us for all kinds of reasons: easier to store in freezer, label, no clean up, sterilization, less to throw away than a whole bottle.There may be competing brands of bags that can be used but they aren't sold by Avent as far as I can tell and I already tried the Medela ones with a yellow strap and those were too narrow.In my opinion this is the best electric pump on the market.It allows you to have full control of the suction speed and the silicone inserts help to simulate let-down faster.(I also own a Medela PIS.)Of course, every pump has its trade offs.Here is my personal take on the Avent pump (as compared to the Medela)Pros:1)  The Avent is a closed system.That means that there is no danger of the milk getting into the motor and growing bacteria there - meaning no later milk contamination.I found the Medela painful when I was just beginning to nurse (even at low suction) but I never felt that way about the Avent.Later on, when I wanted a stronger suction on the Avent, I just chose a lower suction speed.5)  You can seamlessly go from double to single pumping without having to make any adjustments on the pump.(No loss of suction if you decide to stop pumping on one breast.)Cons:1) Takes longer to set up than the Medela.2)  More parts to clean.3)  The suction on the two shields isn't exactly the same; so, it works best if you alternate which side using the control handle each pumping session.Finally, the pump works best if you boil all the boilable parts periodically.For instance, the silicone inserts may not fit well after a month of use; but, after boiling for some reason they fit better again.In all, I highly recommend this pump.I don't believe you will be sorry if you choose it.Looking back, I wish I went with another product.Pros:- Easy to set up- Long extension cord- Parts are pretty sturdy- Takes about 15-25 minutes to double pump and empty both breasts- You can adjust the length and intensity of each pump yourself, like you would with a manual pumpCons:- Did NOT come with a manual pump set up- Does NOT run on batteries - I don't know why Amazon advertises this.This is a AC adapter only.- Funnel is wrong size for me, can't order a bigger or smaller funnelI started out exclusively breast feeding, but was advised to move to a pump after I had a bout of mastitis and my milk supply was very low.I use this pump about every 2-3 hours at home.My nipples are so sore after using this though.The petal 'inserts' catch my nipple during the pump and have caused purple bruising around that area of the nipple.They have also caught my nipple and cut it a bit.My nipples also become sore and partially numb after each pumping session.I have to slather on lanolin like crazy after using this pump.I broke down and decided to rent a hospital grade Medela pump for a bit before deciding if the issues were me or the pump itself.There is NO WAY I could take this pump with me to work though, very bulky bag and set up.I have no idea how people can consider this entire unit a portable product.The travel bag is the size of an airline carry on bag.I don't know, I'm torn about this product.My biggest praises are 1) that it isn't painful to use and 2) it's easy to clean.This hamper is so soft and cute, and the colors are much nicer in person!It's big enough to hold more baby laundry than you'll probably ever have to wash at once, and has a cloth flap on top so that the clothing inside isn't visible.However, after looking more closely at the hamper, I've noticed that the unfinished wood frame is full of "peeling" cracks and splinters.Some of the pieces of wood sticking out would definitely give a child a splinter big enough for a hospital visit to get the whole thing removed.It's definitely cute in my baby's room, but I will for sure be sanding the wood before he is old enough to get his hands anywhere near it!I love the entire set except for the valance curtain.It makes the room a little too dark for my liking even though it is just a valance and not a full curtain, but comes with the bedding set, so no set-back as far as price.The loops that hold this in the frame inside won't just break under the strain from a load of clothes going to the washer.Love this set... would buy Lambs & Ivy again for sure... hopefully they are all as good quality.I purchased this as an add-on to the Enchanted Forest Crib Set my son and daughter-in-law selected for their baby's room.The mesh bag liner is easy to remove, where the tabs act as handles to carry to the washer.We really like the howdy cow.It's really cute, and we can keep it in the living room without our house looking junky and full of toys.Our daughter is 1, and despite the product being for children over 3, we bought it.We may not have blown it up enough, but still I wouldn't trust it to hold her up until she is older.I wish I could give this pump a 5 star review, and I would if I could get it to work consistently, but I can't.I have followed all the instructions on assembly (including putting the clear portion in still wet to help create a good seal), tips on pumping (and other reviewers tips (like replacing the star piece with the cone), and it just doesn't work consistently for me.When I get good, consistent suction, this thing is great!The silicone piece that fits over the flange works great for me, and I get more milk faster than with my Medela Pump In Style.But I'd say at least half the time, if not more, I can't get it to work well and end up giving up with barely any milk pumped.I gave it 3 stars b/c of how much I love it when it works, and if it worked consistently it would be 5 stars.UPDATE: I purchased an Avent Isis single electric pump, and the electric pump works perfectly on these same manual pump parts.I don't know what it is about the manual but it just won't keep suction.Just adding the electric pump to the top fixed that for some reason.When my milk came in, I was so engorged that I could barely even touch my chest without being in pain.I used this from very early on (earlier than people would recommend) but I have had no issues with breastfeeding.I used it in the beginning to relieve engorement.Then after I established a pretty good routine, I used it to store extra breastmilk.i'm not sure how some women get this pump to work so well for them, but it does not work for me.i even wondered if somehow i was doing it wrong, or that i just wasn't really producing milk, but i can express more myself than with this pump, when i called my lactation specialist, she told me this pump is not the greatest and doesn't work for everyone.I am really not happy with this pump.Its super hard to clean, very uncomfy to use and it molded...We didn't check amazon ratings and put this on our list after reading Baby Bargains.After reading Amazon reviews, I was a little concerned.However, after almost one week of usage with our new infant, I'm no longer worried.These bottles don't leak like many other user have reported.Perhaps they fixed the design or had a bad batch.Its a little pain to put the nipple on to the ring after sterilization but I can see there are enough silicon around the ring for a good seal, unless the silicon hardens over time and usage, I don't see how these bottle would leak at all.I have had it with these fancy bottles.They are a waste of money and expensive as well.You think you have a handle on the leaking and the next thing you know the baby is soaking wet!!!The baby HATES it when I take the bottle away, there's real tears!How hard is it to make a bottle that holds liquid?For this price you shouldn't have to have any "trick" to make a bottle work right.I shelved all of these and got Playtex, guess what, no leaks!I have read  many mom blogs and there are quite a few "tricks" out there as this bottle had caused much grief.Do yourself a favor and skip these!A leaky (I am not talking about a few drips, more like half the bottle in 10 seconds drains out!)bottle is more fussing and more mess, who needs that?I like the look & feel.You have to put the top on JUST right to avoid giving your little one a milk bath.Unfortunately, my little one has gotten used to the nipples & isn't adjusting to other bottles I try very easily, so I'm stuck with these.They are very expensive...much too pricey to have this poor quality issue!we thought these would be the best bottles.but they are leaky, no matter how hard you tighten them.both leak.I even stopped shacking the bottles to mix the milk, and instead used a spoon.Those bottles were transparent ( do not have the honey colored hue of our bottles) and never leaked.I received this as gift but I will not buy more avent bottles.There should only be one way to screw on the lids--the right way.Yes, there are tricks to putting them on properly but who wants to mess with that at 3am in the dim lighting?And who wants to have to test whether the bottle is leaking over the sink before feeding to your crying baby?And who wants to teach other care providers the tricks to screwing the lids on properly which may or may not work all of the time?Bottom line is that there are better bottles out there.I don't think it was purchased from Amazon though.Since I'm breastfeeding and bottle feeding, I was looking for a bottle/nipple that would simulate the breast as much as possible.They are more affordable and they have similar nipples to the avent bottles.It's a good bottle but it really leaks sometimes.When I have my next baby I probably won't choose this baby bottle again.The lids leaked within just one week.The leaking was the most annoying thing to deal with on top of everything else.I recommend Dr. Brown's starter set instead.For us, the best baby feeding solution !You can reuse all the products, easy to combine with other options.It steams in the microwave in as little as 6mins and holds six bottles.It uses steam to sterilize, the set includes a bottle brush and a powder dispenser which is great to have in the baby's bag.I sterilized bottles in boiling water over the stove, in the dishwasher and in this microwaveable sterilizer.I found that this product was so much easier than boiling and the dishwasher.When I boiled the item, I would often burn myself with the hot water and I'd have to boil it for 10 minutes or more.The dishwasher took me even longer because I would have to wait until I had enough items in the dishwasher before I could run it.The microwaveable sterilizer takes me the shortest time and its easy to use.Fill the bottom with 7 oz.The sterilizer is great, very convenient and fits in a standard microwave.It probably will not fit into one of the smaller sized ones, but if it will fit in yours, you should definitely buy it!I used to boil my bottles and nipples to sterilize them and didn't think it was such a hassle, but this is a million times better.I actually used to use the avent bottles to store breast milk, since they are large and worked well with the Avent pump, which I also recommend.I can sterilize about 12 nipples at a time and they last me all day.This is a very soft pacifier for a newborn baby and my baby prefers it to the Nuk one I have as well.One thing I learned is that when it comes to baby products, what works for some doesn't necessarily work for others.That said, after trying a bunch of pacifiers this was the one that did the trick for us.We're getting ready to wean him shortly but this saved us a lot of stress from about months 3-11.We also own the harder version of this but he prefers the soft one.These were the same as the ones the hospital issued, only in pink.That is what I wanted, that is what they sent.My son just turned 3 months old and until now, the only toy he's taken an interest in has been the Taggy his great-aunt made for him.The colorful discs are a good size for him to gum and have a gentle rattle that interests him without driving me crazy.As for product safety... the shop owner I spoke with was adamant in her belief that companies make toys, not countries.She personally selects each toy she carries in her store and said that in the 14 years she's been in business, not one of the toys she's carried has been recalled.Of course, this doesn't help with my preference to support companies who manufacture here at home, but that's another issue.In general, I'm not a fan of "busy" toys.Simple, low-volume, open-ended toys are best.This "Skwinkle" is a winner.I actually recommend just about any toy made by Manhattan Toy.Check out their "Winkle" and the "Whoozit" as well.Very good for the baby who's ready to graduate from just playing with their hands.I've been extremely disappointed with it.The bottles ruined my baby's latch although I didn't realize the cause until I switched to a different bottle.He stopped opening his mouth wide to latch onto my breast do to the tiny tip on the bottle nipple.The outer nipple collapses into a triangle shape.My baby can't empty all the milk from the outer nipple once there is no milk left in the bottle.He swallowed A LOT of air because the inner nipple blocked milk from getting to the tip from inside the outer nipple.It was miserable to clean so many nipples too.Got very tiring.The bottles discolored with an orange hue as soon as I boiled them.The hospital classes and nurses staff strongly recommended these even more than the adiri.. and they really are the best and easiest for li'l ones to adapt to if u r nursing.. it's bit more cleaning but then it saves u from all the anxiety of baby not nursing any more and nipple confusion and all that.. however the volume labeling on the bottles disappeared soon aftera few washes but i guess the product is probably still evolving..Last year my granddaughter's baby was breast fed and refused to nurse from every kind of bottle they tried with her.I bought a set of these bottles and the baby took to them right away with no problem at all.Now I have two more graddaughters expecting babies and planning to breast feed, so I bought them each a set of these bottles so they won't have any problem with their babies taking a bottle when necessary.I highly recommend this system because a baby uses the same technique to drink from these nipples as they do in breast feeding.I like these bottles because they are most like my breast.I also loves that the nipple portion that goes on their tongue is relatively short as compared to most other bottles that are super long (IMHO).I used these with my breastfed baby for a short period of time for some medical reasons.She took to them right away and it wasn't an issue getting her to eat.The nipples did collapse on mine but not enough to cause a problem for her.My only issue was that the inner nipple was a tad difficult to clean, nothing horrible but I had to hand wash all the nipples because the dishwasher couldn't get them clean.I LOVED that I could watch and see that her latch on the bottle was the SAME as if she was nursing.When I ended my need to bottle feed (which was only for 1 week, thank god) I was able to pass them down to a friend and her baby loved them just as mine had.When my daughter was a little older, about 2 months, I tried a bottle again (Avent, Dr. Brown, VentAir, Gerber and the ones from my pump, the Medela) and she wanted NOTHING to do with them.So the BreastFlow bottles were the ONLY ones she took.I use these a lot with breast-pumping.I like the fact that they're made from food-grade ingredients, and I sometimes use them to wipe my daughter's teething toys when we're traveling.They smell nice & are soothing.I keep a pack in my pump bag at all times.This was a little thinner consistency so it was easier to apply than some of the other Lanolin creams.There was no grit in it as I read in another review and it didn't feel like sand paper, just like a slightly oily butter.I would have stopped breastfeeding if this hadn't helped me because I was in so much pain.This stuff saved me.I just got a tube of the First Years Nipple Butter and did my first application and I love it already.It is much smoother (and greasier actually) than lanolin, which made it pleasant to apply.I'm using some breast pads with it because I went a little nuts and I'd imagine it could stain with a heavy application.Amazon's price is several dollars less than the in-store price I paid so I'm adding this to my Amazon "shopping list" for the next tube.Right now my boobs feel better than any moment since baby was born.I don't see a difference between the lanolin and lanolin free butter.I guess I'm neutral on this stuff.Many people swear by it; I'm just not one of those people...I guess I will say that because she does not love it, it has not interfered with breastfeeding at all.I gave her her first bottle at 3 weeks, 5 days and she is now 7 weeks old.Edit: At 14 weeks, we are now on another bottle.DD just does not like silicone nipples.I tried NUK, Advent, Dr. Brown's and Playtex, this being the last one I decided to buy.Sorry to say that she refuses this bottle as well as all the others.I don't think that there is a flaw in the bottle I just figure she must not want to use a bottle and prefers me instead.There are people that have complained about milk leaking out of the bottle which I was worried about because any BF mom knows that milk is precious!However there are little areas you push that allow the milk to drain back into the bottle and it explains this in the directions.Also if you are thinking about bottle feeding don't wait too long like I did.I would recommend this bottle because I had no leaking problems with it, and it felt soft and very pliable to my touch.Great design I had no problems at all.I purchased several of these bottles/nipples after we started daycare and my daughter was getting nipple confusion from the Gerbers that fit onto my pump.After about a week of use, I found that the nipples retained the "left sitting out" breastmilk smell and I couldn't get it out.I washed the bottles and nipples in hot soapy water and sterilized from time to time to make sure all the bacteria was destroyed.Unfortunately, after another month of use, my to my horror, I discovered that the inner, darker blue nipples had deteriorated at the opening and either expanded on their own (because I certainly didn't shove anything in there to clean the very opening surface) or split down the side of the nipple (about "!)I immediately looked at the other nipples we have been using and found that every single nipple had that problem.Now, either I have toxic milk - which I highly doubt - or the material is not of the best quality.I called the company the very next morning and told them about this problem that I was having with the nipples.The "customer service" lady took an accusatory tone and said that I must be cleaning them wrong because she'd never heard of that.She said that I only needed to use a soft cloth.Then she offered to send me a replacement nipple pack "just this once."Ok, um, thanks.I received the replacement pack and immediately put them to use.After a week of use, I inspected them again.Guess what I found?!The tips were starting to split - about 1/8-1/6" down the side of the blue inner nipple.I called the company again to tell them about this.Got a different customer service rep and she apologized, asked how I was caring for the nipples and then offered to send me 4 replacement nipples but asked if I would please send them the defective nipples because they are very concerned.I got the replacement packaged, opened it up, and found not 4 replacement Stage 1 nipples but two bottles of the stage 2, 9 oz size.I'm not going to bother with sending them the defective nipples.I am not the only person that's having this issue as other reviewers online have reported the same occurrences.Save your money and try something else.These don't appear to have a very long lifespan.I like the idea, but it just doesn't last.We are switching to another bottle.Finding a bottle that your baby likes is very hard!I would recommend to anyone that they buy several single bottles of many different brands.At only 2 weeks old she actually screamed and pushed it away from her mouth and kept hitting it away.She preferred either the Tommee Tippee, Avent, or Dr. Browns, so I stuck with Dr. Browns.But I have a whole set of Avent's and Tommee Tippee's in my closet... so be smart and buy single bottles until you figure out what works for your baby!!!!!Otherwise you'll have a closet full of bottles waiting to be given away!!!Although I I stopped breast feeding at 5 months, my son had a problem with learning how to drink, and stop to breath.These bottles take alot of work to get milk out- similar to breast feeding, so my son learned how to stop and breath.=)These are the best bottles!Also work very well when your trying to stop breastfeeding- or use a bottle while breast feeding.. very similar.I didn't use this bottle because my baby first took Adiri bottle (which I ordered along with this product) and I we don't need to try this one now.And nipple is soft and looks pretty natural to real breast.My daughter was breast feeding and giving our first grandchild a bottle at the same time since she had had breast reduction surgery and did not have quite enough breastmilk for Isabelle.She had no problems going between this bottle and breast because of the way it is made.There are actually two nipple sections so that the bottle uses both compression and suction to get the milk, just like with the breast.Must say it facinated me.Isabelle never had any problems with it.I have seen reviews with people complaining about milk moving to the outer nipple but that is supposed to happen.We tried Dr. Brown's and Medela bottles for my breastfed son at 3 and 4 weeks old, and he sucked them down WAY too fast... the milk was pouring out of his mouth.This bottle actually requires some time to suck down, and requires a good latch to make it work.The double-chamber is pretty easy to use, and this has fewer parts to clean than the ones with straws.I just throw them in the dishwasher on the "sterilize" cycle once in a while, and hand wash them with soap when I don't do the dishwasher--it's only 4 parts.The wipes are small and will clean a binkie or a small toy but not much else.They are great for cleaning a pacifier that was either dropped on the ground, thrown in a diaper bag with other "stuff", etc.The smell is very pleasant, not harsh or alcohol-smelling, safe for baby to immediately use after wiping.Every mom should carry them in the diaper bag.They have been so useful for those times baby likes to throw toys, pacifier or bottle nipple touches a dirty surface and there's no where to wash.They smell good too!I got them with the intention of using them not only to clean off dropped pacifiers, but small toys, and bottle nipples as well!They are in an easily dispensable package with a great snap-shut cover, but when you pull the top one, 3 or 4 come out, which means you're wasting a few every time you are trying to use just one.They also leave a little bit of a weird taste on the pacifiers/nipples-I didn't think they would, but after I used it for the first time and them gave the pacifier back to my daughter she pulled it right back out of her mouth and made a funny face, so I wiped it down again and then put it in my mouth and sure enough, there's a cleaning product type taste.Now I just use these to wipe down small toys that are in the diaper bag (rattles, etc.It is very durable.The bear is very firmly attached, the back is a smooth clip so it doesn't bother your little one.Everything I expected.I got this product in the hospital after my baby was born.She was just so hungry and my colostrum/milk wasn't sufficient to make her feel satisfied.It's a little awkward to use, and sometimes takes a pair of extra hands, especially in the beginning, but this product has made it possible for my daughter to learn how to latch on, even when she wasn't getting much from ME.Avent bottles are very good.This "Bottle Trainer Kit" is not.This is basically a standard avent bottle with a one-piece plastic drop-over handle.The spout screws on top of the bottle, locking in the handle.Problems with this bottle trainer:1.Avent bottles are too short and fat to be effective for a kid that's sitting up.As soon as a couple of ounces are gone, it takes a steep angle to keep liquid flowing.Handles are awkwardly placed.They are too thin and are too far away from the body of the bottle.They are NOT curved at all in the main portion that the baby holds, and are NOT ridged or dimpled.The worst part - the spout is VERY hard.For a baby that's used to a soft silicon nipple (Avent's standard nipple), this one is too hard.It is NOT ergonomic in any way.Spend your money on another bottle trainer.Try Gerber, Playtex, Born Free, Munchkin or NUK brands before going to this one.The product is ok, I prefer the playtex sippy cup, it seems easier for my son to handle.These wall stickers were easy to apply.I even changed my mind a couple times and was able to remove them and re-stick on a different area.They've been up for about a month and have stayed put!I used the decals to complement the rest of the enchanted forest decor in my baby's nursery and they look great with the tree I painted on the wall.A couple weeks ago, I had some guests over, and several of them asked me "Were those stencils hard for you to paint?"and "Who painted those animals for you?"so they must look hand-painted rather than like a sticker, which is exactly what I wanted.The price is lower than most other sets yet you get the same amount of wall decal.For almost half the price of other sets you get an equal product.The animals are as big as a person's head.The plants are a nice filler too for in-between.The artwork is just cutesy enough to be for children but not annoyingly so.I purchased another set at over twice the price which was more abstract and artistic, and now the more expensive item sits on a closet shelf, while the Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest decal item listed here is up on the wall.The rubber on the front which is supposed to form the seal has worn off after a few years, but we still use the cup.This cup has never worked very well for us.I would have preferred no wall.The way it's designed, it's more difficult to scoop up water and more difficult to control the pouring.We have had no problems with it whatsoever.However, there are 2 improvements that I think could be built into the lock.First, like a tape measure, the cable retracts into the lock when it is not being used.While clever and handy, this feature is also not very well engineered.The retracting mechanism seems clanky to me, and I won't be surprised when it one day will not retract any longer.In other words, if you want to use this lock with less than all of the cable pulled out, you cannot do it.Since the cable release button works when the combination is scrambled, you can simply push the button and pull out the rest of the cable.Then, you could use any length of cable you wish.I would not call this an umbrella stroller, more like mid sized.While we don't own the 4-wheeled one, we have the Zapp in 3 wheels which we purchased when we lived in Europe.I wanted one for so long.We walked a lot on the bricks in Europe and we actually broke tires on our other strollers.I love the tries on this, like a rubbery material.Yes this does not recline so it works better if your child is older.At the tightest setting, our 21 month old can climb out because they are still huge.Ok, I installed this car seat by myself and I have to say it was a bit intimidating at first...but just take it one step at a time and the directions will be easy to follow and they are pretty thorough.You will get the car seat and base.It wouldn't hurt to have a second person look over the directions with you and help install it.I wonder how the children were dressed...and was it summer?The seat may have been hot due to the sun creating a greenhouse effect in the car ya know?And we have to remember that the air conditioning doesn't reach the back seat like it does the drivers seat...Anyway, if I have any issues with the car seat I will update this review.But so far so good.My son seems comfortable and this car seat fits in most shopping cart child seats.This car seat was rated highly in safety and he will fit into it until he is 32lbs, so it lasts much longer than other car seats.We've had the Graco car seat for 8 months now to use with our first child.It's a decent seat, but there has to be better.Here's what we've thought of it:Pros:- The quick-release mechanism works well for removing the car seat from the car and leaving the base still secured in the car.Very fast, easy and functional.- The cover works well, except for the window.- It looks well made and durable.It literally takes up the whole area, not leaving much room for shopping.- We have a family car and a sports car and it is tight in both.It seems like they should be longer.The straps hardly fit my baby if he's wearing a coat.But even without a coat, the straps are too short to move out of the way.You have to take the whole belt apart in the back and re-thread.They could have designed this better.- The seat is HEAVY!It weighs almost 16 pounds by itself.Once you add a baby, it just keeps getting heavier as he grows.Taking the car seat in and out of the car started to hurt my back at about 4 months old.I let my husband take him out if he really wants him in the seat.- No twist-handle makes for awkward carrying.I hold one arm under the handle and the other arm supports the first arm because of the weight.- I wish the window on the cover would have a cover for itself at times.If we want to leave our baby in the seat to sleep, we put down the cover to block his view and make it dark.He ends up looking out the window at mommy or daddy and smiles.Despite how cute it is, he doesn't get any sleep.If we had to do it again, we probably wouldn't get one so large.Maybe upgrading early isn't such a bad idea.This car seat worked great for them.We added an additional head piece though that you can buy from Eddie Bauer.I had to sit my driver's seat straight up and pull the seat forward a bit to make room for the extra length of the 32's.It's a much bigger car seat than the regular snugrides, but I like it better...more protection it would seem.Installation is a breeze with the latch system.The 32's are heavier than the regular snugrides, but it's not too bad for us, but we are strong people.Now that it's fall, I can't even fit a light sweatshirt on my son and get the buckles closed.There's just no slack left in the seat at all.Overall -- My son liked this seat a lot.It has always seemed cozy and safe, and he took many long car rides to see family out of state in this seat.It does get warm in the summer time, but I've looked at friends' seat and I think they are all fairly similar.The seat is also heavy, but I could handle that.I liked it because it was the safer.I just stopped taking the seat out of its base and brought my son to the car in my arms.I know people have complained about this, but if you have a big kid, you can only blame the seat so much.I'm not overwhelmingly excited by this carseat--it's heavy (though my friend and I compared my Graco to her Chicco and there wasn't much difference), the straps twist (annoying till you fix them a million times, then gets easier to fix), and it takes up too much room in my car.I have a Subaru Impreza and unfortunately, this seat won't fit in the middle seat, which was ideally where I wanted it, because we are both tall and both seats need to be pulled all the way up to fit this seat.When my husband and I take our Impreza out together, I have to ride as the passenger with my knees in the dashboard (I'm 5'11 with a 33 inch inseam, so a shorter person might not mind) and my husband can't ride as a passenger at all (husband is 6'2 with a 31 inch inseam but he's built like a hockey player and had problems with my front seat to begin with).Most travel systems are clunky and heavy and I didn't want to lose permanent use of my trunk, which is why I chose this travel system.This frame folds up small so that I can put other things in my trunk, which is great.I think this seat is definitely adequate and I will probably use it again with my second child, though if I had to buy an infant seat again I might look at other brands if, and only if, they had a similar lightweight stroller frame.So yes, it has its pros and cons but ultimately, I liked this more than I disliked it.I think as tall people we really just need a bigger family car.I bought the sungride 32 in zurich because it was the best carseat(in official tests the best safetyscore).I didn't like the collors, still don't but I can live with it, my girl seemd to like the little figures on the canopy.The seat looks very uncomfortable and is hot, it's not heavy on it's own( 4kg) but it is with my 4 month old (7kg)girl in it.The sides of the chair are a bit high, good for safety of cours but my girl does't like it because she can'd move her arms.and she gets a heatrash on the sides of her arms if she's in it.eventhough I alway drive with the airconditioning on.So now i put a clothdiaper in the seat so she doesn't get in contact with the material of the chair..I am going to look for cloth seatcovers.Also even if I reset the belts it still presses in her thighs..(they are a thiny bit chubby.She also sitsup very straith..I believe a bit too straight .. but then it scored best on safety.All that said...If I do strap her in and start driving... she seems to enjoy it and then fall's asleep.We took a long trip of 3 hours a week ago.. and she slept all the way.. it even was a bompy road.So important is.. if you buy this don't relay on using it as a carier.It's good for safety... and that's what's the most important for me.Oh, And it's a hussle to fixate the base in the car, took my boyfriend an hour the first time... second time 10 minutes.I took off the headheadcushion... it made it a litle better for my baby... but still if she's awake... she doesn't like to sitt in the chair longer then a few minutes...if I'm driving it's a bit longer...I think it's because the fabric is extreemly hot...I always have the airconditioning on at 23degrees.. still if I lift her from the seat her back is hot and sweaty...A different fabric would be allot beter I think.Update:My girl is now 21 months and has just outgrown the seat bij lenght (83cm, limit 81cm) she is still in the weight limit ( 26pounds).She's about the P50.the heat issues have gotten a lot less, but only when she got older.for comfort for your child...the padding is not very thick and the covering is easy to clean, but very hot.for safety and economics....it's extreemly good.I think it's fair to say you could use this seat at an average voor 18 months.BTW, I would recomend buying the second base afterall, because installing it without the base seems so difficult that I almost alway drove her in my car.I am looking for the Britax marathon 70 or the graco my ride.good luck.I love it for the Snap n Go--but for me (who is 5 feet tall and a petite gal) to get it in and out of the car and carry my baby (who is only 4 months old and 16 lbs) around in it is very cumbersome.It is very awkward.If you are just going to leave the seat in the car, it may work for you, but who wants to jostle a sleeping baby?I find myself jostling him and just putting him in my wrap when we go out.The next baby will get a smaller infant seat.This car seat has been great for our infant (now 7 months old).In the end, glad we went with this one.It was a little big but managable in our Subaru Forrester.We had to buy a new car - and went with an SUV - it certainly easily fits in it.We will skip the purchase of a convertible seat - again saving some money.The seat is just okay because it has both positives and negatives.When all else fails, we put him in the carseat, swing him in it, and see him calm down immediately.He has slept there during car rides, in stores, in restaurants, and at home.It works great for him for sleeping purposes.Negatives: 1.I drive an SUV, and it is still tight.The clicking noise that is made when you move the handle is VERY loud.I have a hard time getting my hand between the back of the seat and the latch release.Once I do this, the latch does not release easily, which I'm sure is great for safety reasons, but I find it very frustrating when I have to retry the release four or five times to make it work.This often wakes our little guy.Would I buy it again?It is a place of comfort for our son, but the negatives outweigh the positives.This is our first child, so we haven't dealt with any other car seat at this point.I'm hoping there is a better one out there once he grows out of this one.It is hard to rate car seats... because what works perfectly for your situation might not for another person.This works great for us.*We  have a baby in the 90th percentile.* The Snugride 32 allows us to aviod putting him in a convertible car seat much longer (as for even a 50th percentile kid).Even though convertible car seats can be rear facing to about the same 30 pounds, they are much more cumbersome to deal with rear facing than this one.* It is roomier for our little guy than the regular snugride.But once your little one grows to be over about 15lbs... no matter what the car seat you'll probably stop carring him in the car seat anyways.negatives:*This seat is really only useful if you have a larger car as the seat is longer in length.We have a Santa Fe, and even with that large car the front passanger has to move up his seat ending up with bent  legs for a long drive.* You can't put the seat on top of the shopping cart.Again, I compensated by putting it on a chair.OVERALL...I would buy this seat again.Mainly because by the time my guy is 30 pounds, he can move into the forward facing car seat.We can skip the awkward backfacing convertible car seat phase (between about 22-30 lbs).Gotta have a larger car though.I had a baby in July 2009.This logic was faulty for several reasons, which I will outline below.Before I do that, a little background:  I have a big baby.He is 6 months and already over 20 pounds.However, the seat is almost at the end of its life already after only 6 months and 20+ pounds.Why isn't there another setting or two for height?We live in New England and it is now winter and we cannot put him in there with a couple of layers on.We will have to switch to a convertible car seat very soon.2.There is no way you'd want to carry a baby much larger than 20 pounds in his car seat.You would never use this product up to 32 pounds for this reason.You need a stationary seat anyway once the baby reaches about 20 pounds.Another major problem with the Rittenhouse model in particular is the lack of head support for an infant.Our baby's head was always flopped to the side.He especially liked it when he was a newborn but he seems cramped now.We are tight with money right now (who isn't?)and feel that the 32 was a bit of a waste of money.You can purchase a regular [and more lightweight] Snugride for a lower price and use it for the first 3-6 months and then switch over to a convertible seat.While it is admittedly very useful to have a carrier car seat for a newborn, it becomes much less necessary after 3-6 months.Convertible car seats can face rear so you don't have to worry about compromising your baby's safety.Unless you only care about style and not price or practicality, I would recommend saving a few bucks and getting the regular Snugride or some other inexpensive but functional carrier seat for the first few months and investing in a good convertible seat for later on.DD just turned a year and is still under the limits for this seat.It is a HUGE, heavy seat so do keep that in mind.DD started using it when she was already 13 pounds so I have no idea what it would be like for a younger child.That really hasn't been an issue for us since dd is never put in asleep.She has slept in this seat for hours with no issues.I'd definitely recommend it.Pros - love the fabric looks very sophisticated and not "baby"works well with any graco stroller.cons- it is heavy to carry around if you are not going to put it in a shopping cart or stroller.The metrolite stroller does not have Flip it handles which I so needed.Graco certainly put a lot of features into this little machine!Now this not being a stereo, the sound quality is not great and the volume is limited so I would not recommend using this as a mp3 speaker.As a white noise machine, there are two volume settings (soft and loud) and we put it on soft, at the highest volume.For those who also want a night light, there is a soft pleasant blue glow that you can turn on or off on the lid of the machine.Move it a little and the power cord falls out and we have to punch in our settings again.We have not had any problems with the cord falling out during the night as we are careful not to touch it again.The other annoying factor is that you punch in your setting with the buttons but if you overdo it (which is an easy mistake as there are no beeps to tell you if the buttons are activated) it "crashes" and you have to replug the power cord into the machine and start over.So unless Greco comes out with an improved version of this machine, this one works pretty well if you can stand the annoyance factor of the power cord.There's some travel lock or some nonsense trick to making this thing work, so most of the time, for no particular reason I can discern, I can't even get the bleeping thing to turn on!3.It doesn't just start with a click, no there's the top button and the on button and the light button at the top and they need to be clicked in some simon-says exact fashion.4.The volume and options buttons are on the opposite side from the on button, which is awkward to start with, and they are just impossible to find in the dark.5.Even when you can find the buttons in the dark, they are so thin and poorly designed it's impossible to get them to click, especially if you're rocking a slumbering infant.I have wanted to throw this thing across the room many times since I received it and smash it into a million, cheap, Chinese-made pieces.It is easily the worst baby-related purchase I have made to date.I'm good with technology, usually, I swear, but this thing?!UGH.FRUSTRATING.Shop around before you commit to this thing.Just because you should get a white-noise machine doesn't mean you should get THIS white-noise machine.I have used this sound machine ever since I brought my baby home from the hospital.She definitely can't sleep without white noise, but this sound machine is so quiet.At full volume, I still have to put it right next to her head in order for her to stay asleep.Also, the womb sounds didn't work for my baby.It would've been much better if they had put other sounds most babies respond to, like running water, vacuum cleaner, fans and hair dryers.I finally gave up on using the sound machine and now use my iPod player to play some sounds I bought on the iTunes store ("Natural White Noise for Babies").It also refused to play anything from my ipod.It will not work on just batteries with consistency, and when it does, it won't turn off.But, I'm not sure I would recommend it to someone else in light of the problems I have had with the sound machine.I love that it has a connector for an mp3 player and comes programmed with some music.I like the night light and the timer as well.I love this sound machine and I am so glad I purchased it.Could be a little louder for those who live in a louder area or building.My kids fall asleep quickly.The cover is machine washable and I love that!As for the tray being hard to snap into place, it loosens up quickly.I don't believe my daughter could even find a way to get her fingers in the way while I'm closing it.The recline takes a little work, but you should only recline when the child isn't in the chair anyway.All in all, I wouldn't change my purchase of this high chair for anything!A little sanity at dinner time!i bought this a couple weeks ago & not to sure i would by it again... i like the lkooks & it's comfortable for my daughter, but i pinched my thumb in it yesterday really bad & now i'm kinda pissed.it's very functional & does what the manufacturer says.mt isses are with they lare detachable tray.. they mechanism to attach it to the chaie is flimsy & onlt 3 positions for the tray.& the small attached tray is kind of hard to get open.. takes 2 hands.. so if your babys in 1 arm, it's really difficult.. & that's why i pinched myself..trying to get the small tray open while holding my baby...then i couldnt get my finger out while holding her...so i had to set her in the chair as best i could ith 1 hand & het my finger unstuck...lame.my other problem is the recline position is VERY flimsy!so if you had more than 1 kid & they came by & pushed on the back of the chair & a small baby was in it...i could see something bad happening..This is far superior to a bassinette which is nothing but a hooded basket which babies quickly outgrow.This, on the other hand will be multi-functional long after the newborn stage.It can also be used as a play area for outdoors.Others liked the sound machine, but that is a double edged sword.The nature sounds can be soothing, and in some cases can be loud for very cranky and/or sensitive baby.It is also an added convenience.You also get a lot of storage space for clean up work when needed.We have really been happy with this product.It is easy to move from room to room if needed.This is the one that I chose, and I have not been disappointed.The height is just right for us.The sides of the changing table are just tall enough for the baby to stay safe but not feel closed in.Our little one has not slept there, but he has played there many times.Now that he can scooch (is this a word?)around, he likes being in there because the bottom moves just a little bit when he moves a lot.Thanks, Graco!We've been using this pack and play since we brought our son home from the hospital and now he is 10 weeks old.We didn't want to buy a traditional bassinet since it would only be used for a few months and then be useless.Once our son exceeds the bassinet portion, we can still use the pack and play as a play yard.Pros:-The sound machine that attaches to the side is great--the music and nature sounds are soothing.The storage compartment easily holds lots of diapers and a box of wipes.Cons:-It does not fit through our door frames and must be broken down to move from room to room.-While the bassinet is very secure, it does tend to bow in the center a bit.We adopted a child and had three days to get the house ready, so we loved the fact that we could have this overnighted to our home.On the down side, the mattress does not want to lay flat in the bassinet and has 2 ridges where it was folded during shipping.The mattress also requires a bit of wrestling to put on a mattress pad/sheet.And, the wheels are just a shade wider than the unit making it impossible to move through a standard door opening without collapsing the unit, but this was relatively easy to do.I would have also liked for the mobile to be visible without the hood in use - it is hard to get the baby out of the crib without putting the hood down or the changing table up, and you don't want to have to mess with the changing table one-handed with a baby in your arms; drop the hood before getting the baby out so not a big problem.Overall this has met our needs quite well and I do recommend it.If you're looking for a sheet to match, try anything "natural" or "ecru" -- the hanging dogs that dangle from the bassinet top are that sort of color.So very convenient to have it right there.The only downside to the changing table is that the cover/fabric portion is not meant to be removable for washing.Now, the bottom of the changing table is truly waterproof, but the sides are not -- they're a very wettable nylon sort of fabric.I haven't had time to troubleshoot it fully, but it's very frustrating when you're really hoping for that soothing vibration to help the little one get back to sleep at 2AM, and it doesn't work!EDITED TO ADD: The vibration can also be very loud when it does work.I think this is because the "mattress" has hard boards in it.The music is really too low to hear well at all.There is one nature sound that sounds like ebbing and flowing waves -- sort of -- our LO likes this best, perhaps because the rhythmic nature of it reminds him of heartbeats in the womb.4) Lights on the sound/music unit -- really too dim and poorly directed to be of much use.I thought they'd be great, but the one pointing inward never seems to illuminate more than a toe at best, so I usually end up using my phone or a closet light to really see the baby to check for movement/spitup/etc.5) The bassinet itself -- super convenient to have the child up high like that, to minimize bending over.The canopy is cute, as are the dangling dogs, but they don't do much beyond look cute really.The canopy doesn't quite deploy as roundly as you might like, but it would still shade some sun if you needed it to.If you've never had a Pack 'N Play (I know I hadn't) -- the bassinet "mattress" is an accordion-folding set of boards covered in slightly padded nylon.It can tend to lie less-than-flat if you put the baby sideways in the bassinet, rather than lengthwise, which is what my husband likes to do.This sort of nestles the baby in a very slight "V" shape of one of the accordion folds.One thing to note -- the instructions state that the bassinet portion is only good for babies up to 15 pounds.Also, some people find that the bassinet "mattress" feels flimsy to them and they want to add a mattress -- then instructions specifically warn you *not* to do this.I did, however, try to find one that would fit snugly in the bassinet or bottom of the crib just in case -- I failed.The changing table is super useful, even though the cover isn't removable for washing.The music/lights are marginally useful at best because they're very quiet/dim, but the nature sounds work fairly well.The soothing vibration may be great if your baby likes it, but our unit no longer performs reliably at 6 weeks and it can be very loud when it does work.EDITED TO ADD: Note that if you're going to travel with the bassinet attachment and the changing table, you probably won't be able to pack it all into the sack it comes with -- at least we can't.The basic playard fits, but we need a full-size duffel bag to pack the bassinet and changing table separately.UPDATE:  As much as I love this Pack 'N Play, we're extremely frustrated with the vibrating unit -- it won't work even remotely predictably now, and we really need it some nights!During said nights, I'm tempted to downgrade my review drastically, but that's lack of sleep talking.This presents a double edged sword.The Townsend pattern looks very blue in the picture but is actually a dusty blue and seems a little duller in person.Comfy chair but all features automatically shut off after 10 or 15 minutes.This chair was a baby shower gift.I like many things about it -it folds up flat (well, almost flat); it has a plush insert; it looks very nice; the mobile toy is great; and it has a buckle.But it also has three minor problems:-It does not bounce.It vibrates.Nice most of the time, but it is not a substitute for a bouncy chair.-There are only 5 pre-programmed songs, and there is no volume control.They repeat, and get annoying.-The plush insert is not removable, so unless you have a "medium" sized baby, it can get in the way.And, it has two MAJOR problems:-It is a "sling" design (no form to it), so as the baby falls asleep s/he can slide down into the chair.This is a potentially SERIOUS problem.So if you own this, watch your baby closely the first few times you use it.-The yellow dial (you can see it in the photo) is exactly where the baby's feet are.So if you baby kicks at all, s/he will hit that hard plastic.Come on, Fisher Price - there's only one hard piece of plastic on the whole device.WHY ON EARTH would you put it exactly where the baby's feet are?This infant seat is so soft!We bought this seat because a friend said her newborn stayed in it all of the time.This was not a good decision.While our son really didn't complain about sleeping in this during his first ten days of life, he has not really spent any time in it since then.He simply doesn't like it.I'm almost convinced that it is because of the angle of the seat.He is squished down in it as soon as he sits in it.I don't like the fabric.He starts sweating almost as quickly as I put him in it.At four months, he will sit in it for ten minutes or less swatting at the inadequate toy that floats above the seat.The vibrating mechanism has never done much for him nor has the music.The one thing I do like about it is its portability.When we first brought our son home, he would sit in this on the table, on the ottoman, on the floor, or anywhere.It was nice to have him with us but not in our arms.Beware that the seat does not fit through a standard doorway when it is flat.That means that if your child falls asleep in it, you better like the room you are in.I would not recommend this product.Better products are out there.I thought it looked really comfortable, and had gotten lots of great reviews from friends.My daughter (now 5 months old) really never had any interest in it.When she was tiny, I could at least put her in it while I took a shower, but she was screaming b/4 I even got out.Once she got a little older, it's just boring.At her daycare they have a boucer that is very brightly colored that has a mirror and lights up, and she loves that one.We wanted to get something to keep upstairs since we are too lazy to carry the bouncer up and down the stairs.We decided on this because of the soft, plush fabric and the cute design.While he did spend some time in it, if I had to chose between the bouncer and this, I would chose the bouncer, hands down as we have gotten so much more use from it.This playmat is one of the best.It has a lot of toys, and it's great that you can switch the toys around and use other toys on it as well.The toys it came with are nice, especially the rattles.He likes the polar bear as well, especially because it activates when he moves... so when he starts to fuss, it plays music and that entertains him for a short while again.I love that this product includes a mirror- our baby loves to look at himself in it.And all the animals that go along the bottom are nice and bright and grab his attention as well.This type of gym in general is a must have for every baby.I think it a fun product.It is a plus that you can change the hanging toys when the baby gets bored.Just don't put the mat in the drier, it gets ruined because it is 100% polyester.It's super cute.The only negative is do you really need one?But this is a good solution overall for tummy time and interactive toys.For the past two months, my 4 month old son has spent a good 30 minutes a day on this mat.He enjoys looking at all the toys, especially the blinking red nose on the polar bear (which I placed on the top of the gym so he can see it when he is on his back).I have also hung some of his other favorite toys from the bars and I move the toys around to give him some variety.The mat has been through several washings and it still looks brand new.This is such a cute bouncer and I love it very much.The lights and sounds my baby loves and it is so cute with all the animals on it.I am only keeping this because reviews for other bouncers always seemed to have some sort of noise issue, or something else.I figured they all have something annoying about them.The vibration unit on mine is ok but I heard others had issue, but you can tuck a pillow or blanket under it for the noise (I work with babies as a RN and I've done this with the bouncers we have at the hospital too).The activity center is alright.The fish don't do anything other than move a little IF the baby can hit the whale, otherwise they don't move.my baby likes the fan but not if it's on high).My baby had reflux and spit up issues and we can't put him in this just after he has eaten, we need to wait at least an hour (he likes to be at a 30deg.incline, but the bouncer is more than that).When I do use it he can usually stand maybe 15 minutes in it (8 weeks old)I'm not sure how it compares to similar products, but we love it.We started using it when our baby was a few weeks old and he still uses at 4 months old.He only likes the activity bar for about 10-15 minutes a day, but when you're trying to keep your baby entertained while you get a few things done, that time comes in handy.He's six months old now, and has used it since we brought it home from the hospital.As a movement-loving baby, he thrives in this thing, and sat in it constantly as a newborn (when he wasn't being held) so he could look at us and his mobile.We even changed his diapers in it, since his reflux made him lose much of his lunch if we laid him on his back for a diaper change right after a feeding.Now that he's older, my son can very effectively bounce himself by waving around his foot, and the seat never fails to put him in good spirits.He enjoys the toy bar, too, and I'm sure we could hang other toys on it if he gets tired of the three rings/animals.I wish all our baby stuff washed up like this seat.We have friends with babies who have different bouncy seats, and my husband and I are so glad we have this one.The metal base is a little wider than the seat, with rubber corners, so the whole thing is very stable -- again, more so than others we've seen.This was a gift from my registry and I really got a lot of use out of it.My little one wasn't keen on the vibrating option or the hanging toys and never napped in it like others report, but he loved the supported angle at which he could sit during his first 3 months.He was always by my feet in this chair watching me as I cooked, typed, cleaned, dried my hair, whatever.Once he reached about 23.5 inches (he was 21 at birth), his feet started hitting on the base bar.It's not practical for general use anymore because he hits his feet too hard on the base.All that said, we really got a lot of use out of this and just about every other mom I've met who has one also sang its praises.But bouncy chairs are like swings are like car seats are like any other baby holding contraption: some babies love them some babies hate them.Go figure.He never sprays out the side or front like he does when he uses a bjorn potty.I wanted something really simple and easy to clean.This frog is so simple in design and the high part in the front allows all the pee to go into the bowl where it is supposed to - we haven't had any splashing.It's definitely a good potty for training boys.The one tiny design flaw I have found is that the legs, meant to stabilize the potty, can get in the way of my son sitting down - especially when he has his pants down at his feet.It's really not that big a deal and my son is getting used to it, which is why I still gave this item 5 stars.One of the features I really like is that the frog has a built in handle at the back (can't see it in the pictures here) and it makes it really convenient to move it around.I would definitely recommend this potty.I bought this to replace a fancy singing one given to us that proved to be too bulky, too complicated, and too difficult to clean.This is simple to clean, and stays cleaner as well.The large blue insert keeps poo smears or pee droplets on the removable insert rather than allowing anything to get on the base.He was always a little scared of the giant singing potty monster, but eagerly sat on this one.The only problem we had was that the rear of the blue insert is a little narrower than the rest of it.This did lead to some poo on the green base if my son was sitting to far back.But it doesn't happen often and it's not really a design flaw.It's a fact of potty training.We bought this potty for my 2-yr-old after trying another "delux" potty, with soft cushion, high back, etc.I thought this froggy potty looked uncomfortable, but apparently I was wrong.My son sat on it at a friend's house and went potty all week, using this one!!And to clean, just grab the inner pail, rinse out, and done!I am annoyed that we spent the money on the other one.We now have 2 of these - one upstairs and one downstairs.I got this chair for my daughter and she LOVES her "frog potty."It is easy to clean and light weight and small.Sometimes after sitting on it for a while, she will have some red marks on her legs.However, all the potties I looked that which had padding were reviewed as being hard to clean.This is definitely a no frills potty, it doesn't talk or make noise, but it gets the job done.Personally, I did not want to spend a lot of money on a potty chair and so far this one has worked perfectly fine for our use :-)Anyway, because of the way this potty is designed, it forces him to spread his legs rather far apart in order to "straddle" the eyes of the frog (the shape of the eyes is to messes when training boys).This makes it hard for him to get up and down off the seat.I also wish it was just shorter.But it isn't enough to overcome the design problems.We're going with the Baby Bjorn instead.I went to a local Walmart store and found all 3.The Princess Potty was already open so I was able to set it up on the floor to see how big it was and even let my 2 and a half year old daughter sit on it.It was great, cute, and my daughter liked it, but I already have a potty that sits on the big potty and already have a step stool so I really didn't need that one, plus the basin/bucket to hold the contents is VERY small.The Cheer For Me Potty was about the same as the Princess Potty but with more bells and whistles (toilet paper holder, flusher, etc) and also more than twice the price of the frog potty and about 10 bucks more than the Princess Potty.I really didn't need all the enticement to go potty since she's been peeing/pooping on the big potty and on her Fisher Price On the Go travel potty for about a year now.'d" several times, and now that she is used to her travel potty (which we LOVE by the way) and it was a little too difficult for every day use (GREAT for travel/outings tho), I want to keep it in the car.Months and months ago, she had seen the frog potty and was very upset when we didn't leave with it.I thought it was geared more towards younger babies so I didn't even look twice at it, well, maybe I did, but for the oh so cute factor!!I'm picky about potties - I want it to be easy to clean.Frog Potty IS very easy to dump out (just lift it off and dump, that's it) and clean.I wanted a seat that wouldn't do that.Any spraying pee will only get on that one piece.So far, this hasn't been a problem, but I did figure out a trick if that were a problem!(and kiddo should still be comfy on the potty even without the pink/blue basin insert)  Yay!Yes, You'd have to clean the inside ring of the frog potty, but it's so simply designed that it would be very easy!And still easy to clean - lift up the frog, grab bucket, dump, and clean - woohoo!This frog stays put and is very sturdy - I can see that it might slide around a little on hardwood/tile/linoleum, but get some grippies for the bottom or just toss a rug under it and it's perfect!The backrest is a great height.My 2.5 year old daughter is 35 1/4 inches tall and weighs 29 pounds and while this potty is lower than some, she's still very comfortable on it.The pink/green version's green is more of a spring green.I can't get my daughter to *stop* using this potty.She wants to be on it all the time, and she giggles when it sings to her.Be careful though, the songs get stuck in your head."toi-let paper, toi-let paper..."I have 2.5 year old little girl.Point of Comparison: I had previously bought the Bjorn potty, which received rave reviews on here.My daughter did not much care for that one and we had little to no success on that one.The Bjorn just seemed a little too narrow for her and, frankly, had no interest for her.So I bought this one up at a local store one day.We have no problem with the ring around the bum on this one.LIKE A MINI TOILET: It looks like a real toilet but it's just smaller and has a cute face on the back.It even has a fake flush knob and a roll for toilet paper, which I ignore and do not use, because I don't want my daughter distracted and playing with toilet paper.Also, it has the lid, which has never been a problem or led to an accident, because she couldn't get up fast enough.Also, my understand is that the top part could be used a potty seat to transition to the big toilet.Unfortunately, my toilet is oblong so it doesn't fit, but it's nice to have versatility.SUCCESS: My daughter was potty trained really in a matter of days on this potty.In fact, in the beginning, I think she stood up too soon when she tinkled because she wanted to dance to the song.Not a big deal, just meant more trips to the potty because she was never quite done.Of course, her Daddy and I did the potty dance with her and made a big deal about every time she did her business, but it's nice that the potty keeps up the positive feedback even when Mommy and Daddy forget.POSSIBLE ISSUES:I really have nothing negative to say about this potty.I will say though that with any sensor/battery operated thing you're going to get wonky results from time to time.For example, I think if water gets on the sensor after washing the basin, it can cause it sense action where there is none.On one or two occasions, I've had the phantom "toilet paper, toilet paper, on a roll, next to me..." going off in the middle of the night, which wasn't ideal since my daughter was sleeping in the next room.Also, sometimes it doesn't do a great job of picking up #2, but overall, the sensor is pretty good and I'm very happy with the potty.NOT ANNOYING OR UGLY: Also, the songs are not incredibly annoying.And although I initially bought the Bjorn becuase of the positive reviews and fact that it's not a giant elmo toilet in the middle of our main bathroom, I think although this potty appeals to children because of the face, it's really not an eyesore.We have standard height sinks and toilets, and our 3 1/2 year old is about 36 inches tall, she has no trouble at all reaching anything.The hippo has a nice non-skid surface on top, and little non-skid pads on it's feet so it doesn't slip off the floor and our child doesn't slip off of it; it's also light enough for her to pick up and carry over to whatever she needs to reach, which is both helpful to us and makes her feel more independant, so that's good.We've been really happy with it our hippo, I think I paid ten bucks for it, so I'd say it was money well spent.I love the fact that i can fold up this highchair and take it with me.I also love the fact that my daughter can sit at table like  big girl with the rest of the family!I already have one similar to this without the toy attachments and love it.The added toys to the already nice booster seat makes this an added bonus!!The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the toys.She plays with them for less than 5 minutes and then wants to get out of the chair or play with something else.They're completely backwards on mine (slow is fast; fast is slow) so when I went to use it the first time (I put it on the high speed to test it) nothing happened!!That was 6 months ago and my hubby finally figured out last night that the controls were switched.I wish I had known that 6 months ago so that my daughter could have gotten some use out of it.This swing is too fast even on the slow option.I tested the swing even with 2 (5pound) weights and a baby bag to see maybe it had to do with baby weight.Big mistake.The swing was swinging faster.Waste of money.Too bad.I purchased this swing to take with us when traveling.I already had the Rainforest Jumper for my daughter and ordered this version for when I take her into work with me (twice per week).This version is less interactive for her than the Rainforest version.The section with all the lights doesnt really have much for her to touch - it's not really obvious to her to spin the ball and she's too young to have the strength/ability to push the bar to make the lion spin.The rainforest version has the hanging monkey and parrot that she can bat at, and it also has a spinning wheel that makes animal noises & it's easy for her to make it turn.the whale is OK, but she prefers to spin the sun on the rainforest jumper.Things I dislike about both version - the toy that dangles is kind of out of sight and really not that exciting (and technically they can be a bit deceiving in some of the picture where they show the object standing straight up when it never does that), and both versions have a spinning wheel to the right of the section with the lights/music that is really kind of a waste.I also feel they cheaped out by putting in that little snack holding section instead of another toy - I'm not sure how many people are going to put Cheerios or something on a toy that the baby JUMPS in and would consequently spill all of their snack on the floor.I know my daughter is only four months old and she may very well gain appreciation for these functions later, but I still think the Rainforest version is more fun.we bought this jumper thinking "another thing hes gonna play and forget about"  but he loves it hes 18 month and still loves to jump around now he even asks us to put him in he watches his favorite cartoons there,sings,plays and even falls asleep in it its great!totally recommend it.He is almost four months and we have been using it for just over a month now.I bring it into the kitchen and he entertains himself while I make dinner...have also brought it into the bathroom- lets me shower and dry my hair!My little one is almost never happy unless he is being held and this jumperoo has been the answer I needed!He seemed really tired and bored of just laying on the floor and playing so I thought this would help.He was able to hold up his head very well at 3 months but even on level 1 of the bouncer he couldn't come close to reaching the floor with his feet while in the jumper.We put pillows under him but he still didn't like it.I'll add that my son is very underweight (which is why he didn't fit in it) and he was VERY fussy up until he was 5 months old.I believe those are the reasons he wouldn't play in it at first, but now that he is 6 months old he can reach the floor and he loves to jump!FEATURES: The seat spins around for babies to play with toys surrounding the jumper, such as a spinning butterfly, a whale mirror with moving parts, a spinning fish scene and a lion that spins and lights up.I set mine to play only when he jumps so I know he is playing and not just sitting there bored when I'm out of the room.The seat cover detaches and cleans in the washing machine - we discovered this after he pooped all over it one day!Babies up to 25 lbs.can use this jumperoo.It was easy to set up.I would not recommend this for babies under 5 months of age, but older than that is fine, unless you have a very long baby that can reach the floor.We have friends that have the Rainforest Jumperoo.I purchased this jumperoo when he turned 4 months and has been jumping in it every day since then (he's now 6 months old), I guess he isn't tired of it yet.THIS IS THE BEST use to get your baby to BED!We do understand this could just be that our son is very quick in his development, but I am certain that the exercise has helped him develop stronger legs.He loves the rotating toys and once spent an hour starring at it while making the balls rotate.We purposedly never showed him how the toys work, and I think he finds them much more interesting as he figures them out -- cognitive development.Now that he's 6 months, we only put him in the jumper whenever he isn't tired enough for bed, or when mommy and daddy need to eat.We have, however, bough a different toy that allows a little more movement (walking exercise) to supplement with this one, since our son wants to walk already.Good luck!!It's one of the best purchases we've made for him.I bought it for my baby and it worked for alittle bit and then the mobile stopped working and the projection light stopped working.I called Customer Service for Fisher Price and they said that I could ship it in and they could fix it but I never bothered because it would take 4-6 weeks to get it back.I returned it to the store and it did the same thing.Save your money and just get a regular mobile instead of this one.\\All I have to do is press the remote then she settles herself after a few minutes.Since it is a projection mobile she can still see the animals even when the room is dark at night.Since this has helped me sleep longer over the past 3 nights this $34 mobile is well worth it!I called Fisher-Price to ask about an issue raised in one of the 1-star reviews (about the canopy falling).The customer service representative said that the canopy was redesigned in November 2009 so it no longer attaches via a screw.The canopy is now attached via a piece of plastic that snaps on (make sure to put in on the right way with the end that snaps located on the bottom).Hopefully that solves this issue... fingers crossed (I'll still keep my eye on the canopy!).So if you have a canopy that attaches via a screw that is the old design before November 2009.The representative told me to look at the embossed numbers at the bottom of the box near the barcode (DDDDLL where D = a digit and L = a letter) and said that my mobile was manufactured in 2010.I asked how one could verify that myself.She said that there are 4 digits and if the last one is a 0 that means it was manufactured in 2010.great product!!!I got this from the baby registry, and I set it up before baby was born.He didn't really enjoy the mobil too much at first.He is 8 months now, and he still enjoys this.Never put him to sleep though.As the baby gets older, you can take down the canopy and the projection shines on the ceiling, this increases the life of the mobile as other ones go into storage by the time your child is 6 months or so old and can sit up and potentially pull it down on themselves.Once baby can stand, he/she can activate the music by themselves - and the machine is so securely attached, there is no chance your child can get it off the crib bar.CONS:The design is made for "straight" crib bars only.I don't think this mobile would securely fasten to a crib that had a curved back bar.I found the batteries lasted forever, but when they started to go we initially thought the mobile was breaking.Once they were changed (took a while to figure out) it was no problem.It is a little complicated to get the mobile canopy off and to put the thing back together properly.RECOMMENDATION: Buy it.There are a few constructive criticism points I would like to make though.First of all it is NOT high quality.We have gone through more than one of these until we seemed to find one that would stand up to regular use.There was a lot of returning of this product.I love Amazon, but you might want to buy it from a retailer that it is easier to do returns with.Second, getting it tight to the crib is difficult and when your child learns to kick or hit it to turn it on you might come back in to the room and see it leaning to an angle.Third, it has a big imprint.This is not a problem for me but this will not work with all cribs.There are a lot of things that I love about this mobile too.It does not eat batteries, but it does use D's.I received this mobile off of my registry before the baby was born, and have been using it ever since, it is a wonderful part of our bed time routine and I have not had any problems with it, nothing as another reviewer mentioned it burning out or stopping to work, that is unless the batteries need to be changed.It lasts a looong time.I have several baby items at home that seem to require a battery change almost every other week!This thing I have only changed it twice since I have started to use it, and that's over 5 1/2 months now!The music and light stays on for about 20 minutes, and even when it turns off, it doesn't do that all at once, it first turns off the light, then a few minutes later it turns off the turning motion, then the music fades away, doesn't abruptly stop, so there is music then silence.My son usually takes a bath at 8, gets dressed, eats in his dimmed room, with the mobile playing, then falls asleep to a little rocking by Mom while listening to the mobile.It also comes with a remote, so that when he was younger and really needed constant noise to keep him asleep, I could simply turn it on from his door rather then make creaky noises on his wood floored room.Overall I love this mobile, have had no problems with it, and plan on keeping it to use with my future babies!A parent knows that eventually the mobile will need to be removed from the crib, because the baby will grab the animals, so she allowed the mobile to project onto the ceiling - brilliant!Yes, it is more expensive than other mobiles, but it's worth it.However, I find the Aden and Anais swaddle muslin wrap is better.We use a long sleeved shirt underneath and a diaper, the shirt provides the necessary friction to keep his arms in, and he sleeps for 5 hour stretches when he's in this blanket!Our 17 lbs baby is still swaddled and we have no issues with these.Helped out a lot during our son's very fussy period.This is a must-have, and I am buying more!also made in the USA... i bought one for a friend who is also expecting.He sleeps much longer when he is wrapped in this blanket.Ok, theres a lot of toys in one box.But not all of them I would recommend.Such as the rattles that strap to your hand or feet.The other stuff are ok. Good for teething.The baby likes it and that is about all that matters.She likes the crinkly sound of her skirt the best.This is a fantastic baby carrier.I used it for 9-10 months with both my children.A great product.We've used this Bjorn from the time our little one was about 7 weeks old until now!(She's nearly 7 months old.)These babies aren't feathers...It cleans up well and functions just fine.I've noticed that this Bjorn is a TITCH smaller in length than the original black one.I'd buy it again.My daughter, who is about 6 months old, wants me to hold her all the time.There is assembly required, so it took a little time to set it up for her.She is able to turn around the bouncer to play with the toys.Another thing is that it is neutral, so boys and girls can enjoy it.The theme is flowers and bugs.I had bought a very similiar one, that closely resembles this one, for my son when he was younger, but couldn't use it because of a mold problem in the storage.He REALLY liked it, even though it doesn't really bounce.However, last night, my little man was in it, and my 2 year old was playing with him outside of it.She was showing him one of the toys that you are supposed to be able to push down and it pops up and makes a little ball bounce.Badly enough that she has a little blister and still says it hurts.I can understand that no toy can be 100% safe, but my daughter was using this toy like it was meant to be used.She was not mangling things or being naughty.I will not let my children play in this toy anymore, and I hope it is recalled.Pinched fingers are not life-threatening, but they are annoying and should not happen.I recently purchased this car seat for my 9 month old who is 18 pounds and 28in long.I love this car seat.I looked over the other reviews and decided to try it anyway.One review said that the crotch strap pinches, but to me the strap seems plenty long enough.Others said that it wouldn't fit in their vehicles very well.Others said that it seemed their babies would outgrow it too soon.The cushions are great.I don't use the cupholder at this time but maybe in the future.Out of all the car seats I researched, this one seemed like a good choice for the money.I got the ABBY design and it's so cute.This is a great chair.It's light weight and easy to assemble.The chair is a bit low, though.I would recommend to others.We got this high chair mainly for camping - it folds up completely self contained and a small size so it won't take up much room in our RV.The chair is sturdy and the tray snaps in so it doesn't jiggle around - it's a very sturdy tray, not flimsy at all.See my pictures to confirm what I say - my grandson is 16 mos old, 30 lbs and nearly 3 feet tall...he fits great with room to grow!Nice product overall; haven't taken it out to a restaurant yet, but worked great at a recent family gathering; one slight complaint...the tray is difficult to snap into place and if not snapped correctly will often "pop" back out..can be quite hazardous to the kid sitting in it...Compared to other baby stuff I've put together this month it is a breeze!Tray probably is the hardest thing to put on, but it is a lot easier than others have posted here.Just stand behind it, make sure the tray is flush on the arms, apply slight pressure down and pull back.Tray will slide into the first notches and stop.Hard to find these things lately, so hopefully they keep making them if I need another later.This exersaucer is good in the fact that it does not have wheels, but lacks in the baby fun area.My daughter will play wth it for about 5 minutes before getting bored.There really is not very much on here to keep her interest.although it does light up and play songs that she likes there could be more interactive toys.the ones on the exersaucer are essentially boring and dont do much of anything.We looked at several ExerSaucers before purchasing this one.He mastered turning around very quickly and enjoyed every aspect this toy had to offer.Very impressed with it and would recommend it to others.As an activity center for the baby to sit in, this is great because the baby can turn around and do all the activities.What's nice about this product is that you can transform it from a seated center into a standing activity center; however, when you do that, not only is it space consuming, but it is extremely unsturdy.Also, it's very easy for the baby to push his or her weight and knock it over.It is very cute with many great toys.However, this isn't that big of a deal in my opinion.There are a couple of things I don't love about this exersaucer, first one being that the three toys on the back (or what I consider the back) are pointless.Wish better toys were selected for that part.Also, I was excited to have another playmat but honestly we never use this one because it's just easier to have one you don't need to assemble everytime he wants to play with it.This one you use toys from the exersaucer itself and it's not even connected to the actual playmat it just sort of sits there so it's very easy to knock over.With that said, we do use the mat part by itself for tummy time so I guess it's not completely useless.Regardless of the cons, I do highly recommend this exersaucer because the pros are well worth it.At the begining he was very timid using it, but then he began to discover the toys.Also, it is very helpfull for busy moms, because once you put your baby on it, it allows you about half an hour to 45 minutes of baby free hands to do some chores at home.After my son got nine monts he didn't want so much being put inside to jump, but from then to now he loves to move around the saucer and play with the toys.Great investment of money!My baby has been using this for 2 months now.She can "pick" the flower and pull the snail out (they snap back in).I have read in multiple reviews that the stuffing will eventually start to come out of the tree.That has not happened to us yet, but the way she tugs on the tree leaves, I am sure that day will come soon.I did not realize tugging on the leaves made a sound until just the other day.She is entertained and I can get a load of dishes done or dinner made, it is a great baby gear item.The Exersaucer has a few major flaws: The bottom edge of the light green part of the plastic has sharp/rough/unfinished edges.I have scratched myself several times standing up next to it and I've very nervous that once my babies start to crawl and want to crawl UNDER this thing that they are going to cut or scratch their little heads.Also, as another reviewer stated, the clip for the beehive toy doesn't work.The toy pops loose whenever the bee is pulled.I noticed that the other toys are also getting looser as time goes on.I'm worried they are going to start popping loose soon.And last, the lid for the snack tray comes off.It was this way from Day 1.Really the only reliable toy on this exersaucer is the tree and the bug arch.The mechanism to secure it is very shoddy and it takes herculean force to open it even with two hands when 'secure'.Steer clear, my friends.This gate was difficult to install.OK, part of the reason could be because I cut off the zip tie holding the gate closed before I had the gate completely installed.The instructions tell you not to cut it off until everything is installed...I thought I had it installed to my liking, but later decided to shift it a bit.Once you cut off the zip tie it's very difficult to install.This means if you later want to install it on a different doorway, because the zip tie has already been cut off, it'll be difficult to install - definitely a two person job.Once we were able to get it properly installed it worked great.There are two tricks: 1) make sure the tension on each of the screws is properly adjusted - the indicator dot will be completely green when the tension is adjusted correctly; 2) to open the gate, pinch the two buttons with your fingers while using the heel of your hand to push down on the end of the handle that's on the OPPOSITE side from the two buttons (don't try to push down on the handle where the buttons are - it won't work).I put off buying a gate for awhile because I wanted one with a "door" and found them to be very pricey.Once I figured out how to mount it installation was very easy, and I can still close my door with it installed if necessary (as a sound barrier when my son is sleeping).All four mounts adjust independently which is helpful for doorways with trim at the bottom.He jiggles on the door frequently and it has remained very secure.I am here to buy two more.When this one arrive and I installed it, I guess Evenflo changed how the handle opens the gate because it didn't work the same.To me it seemed more difficult and would sometimes get stuck.The one thing I like about the Dreambaby vs the Evenflo is that it automatically closes behind you, so there is no worrying if the gate is closed.I loved the Summer Tall Deocrative Walk Through Gate, gave it 5 stars, and I also like this one.Its pretty easy to set up, it stands firm, and its just as easy to take down and fold right back into the travel bag it comes with.Only downside is that there is no door u can walk through, you have to simply step over it.We liked how it was in pretty good condition other than a little bit of wear on the fabric portion from their younger kids holding onto it over the years.However, the one we had wasn't big enough for the openings that we wanted to block off.When I saw that Evenflo made one that would fit the opening between our living room and dining room (which is the largest opening we have), I was thrilled!We purchased it at a local store and it was installed within 5 minutes of opening it up.And it's even short enough for a shorty like me (5'1") to step over easily!We purchased this gate after buying a metal one with defects that had to be sent back.It also has a more sophisticated opening mechanism (I assume because of changing safety standards).It also doesn't need to be installed and doesn't require any tools or holes in the walls.The parts that adjust the size are now more involved and require the instructions be read to understand how to work it, the old one was easy to figure out.It's tall and must be climbed over.I'm 5'4" and I can just barely get over it.Our older kids, who are allowed to go in the rooms the gate is blocking off, cannot get over it and must be lifted over it or walk around through another part of the house.The old model had short sides that could be removed so the top bar could be put a couple inches lower but this one has built in locking sides so the height cannot be adjusted.It must be installed above the baseboards, which adds to the height.Ultimately, we didn't feel safe having this gate, because he kept pushing against the gate, and will eventually be able to make it fall down.We returned the gate.I recommend getting a solid gate instead for blocking off toddlers out of an area of your home.The "Solid" gate we ended up buying was "KidCo G15 Center Gateway with Walk Through Pressure Gate".I bought this gate because I didn't want to have to attach hardware permanently to my walls and I didn't want to pay an arm and a leg for a wood gate that would span 60 inches.It's a little tricky to put up at first but once I got it up I was impressed with how securely it stayed in place.Once I got the hang of putting it up, I can do it pretty quickly.Once I figured out the 'secret' of folding it up (get the vertical bars unhinged before undoing the horizontal bars), taking it down was a snap.I also love that it folds so it can be easily stored out of sight when not in use.For the price, I couldn't ask for a better product.But it's something to think about if you want it for a pet.I bought this gate because it was so cheap, it covered the space I needed it to, and because my 1 year old likes to bang his head against things (I know, strange phase we're going through currently).It is constantly slipping down.Plus, this gate is a pain to take on and off.No good!Now I have to re-paint AND buy a new gate.p.s.If you are putting this gate on a framed doorway that would probably be best, I DO NOT recommend on a painted wall!good gate - sturdy & simple to install (though I have yet to figure out the side latch release to make adjustments/uninstall ... either something is wrong with mine or it's a really stiff release button!).But I easily worked around the problem by loosening the top/bottom poles.It otherwise meets my expectations and serves its purpose well..I know this gate is meant for children but it even does a great job of keeping my dog out of trouble.It took us a little while to figure out how it worked properly, but once we got the hang of it the gate worked perfectly.My dog can't knock it over or jump over it.I'm using it to block off a 40" entrance to my son's playroom (aka family room) since there isn't an actual door.The only con are the directions which are more confusing than the gate itself.I would definitely recommend this to others!I ended up using this to block our fireplace for child safety.After spending a frustrating hour or so trying to install this gate, my husband and I quickly decided to return it back to Amazon.Not so.Gladly, the gate did fit our hallway, so we decided to set it up there instead.Unfortunately, this soon led us to realize the biggest problems with this product:  it is extremely awkard to assemble and put away.The buttons are concealed beneath the thick fabric, which is slippery and difficult to grip.The buttons themselves are awkward to locate and hard to push.The instructions are astonishingly lengthy and were vital in order for us to figure out how to put the gate up.We heaved a sigh of relief when it was packed back away, and returned it back to Amazon immediately.Not a good product, at all.This is good for a backless booster.We use it for my 5-year-old (45" 41 lbs) when we fly as it is just smaller to lug around with everything else.It's easy to clean - just wipe down.The things I don't like are just because it's backless - she slumps really badly if she falls asleep in it, no head protection in a crash.If you're looking for a backless, I highly recommend it.I swear I was going to be "that person" who didn't have bunch of baby madness in their house so I was not planning at ALL to buy one of these gizmos.Once the bouncy chair was too stagnent for our little dude, we had to find something else.So after knowing that another mom found it to be a sanity saver..I went in to buy one.Pros:-it's not too fancy, it has just enough to stimulate your child (we started him at 4 months)-theres a ton of toys that it comes with so your child wont get bored-it's "footprint" is pretty small as far as "excersaucers" go-I like the springy action and the fact you can adjust it as they grow-you can also change out the toys with ease-it doesnt have lights and battery operated sound which I wanted.Who needs THAT much stimulation?I didn't want that for my child-stable, sturdy, easy to put together (I did it in about 15 min)-this buys be at least 30-45 min so that I can make dinner, go to the restroom, eat etc.For this it was WELL worth the money!!-great to get your baby off his/her back to reduce flat head syndrome!Cons:-cost of course and it's another "baby thing" that will be in your living room.Oh well who cares.This is a great little station for the money.It cost about half of most of the comparable toys I looked at and my son enjoys playing in it.I can see the toys boring him after a while but we can always replace them with others.My daughter loves this jumper, we didn't even have to put the batteries in the toy tray for a month because she was so happy with it.My only problem with it is that I have a skinny baby and I could fit two of her in there until I put a blanket around her waist so her arm and leg wouldn't go through the leg holes.The only way they don't leak is if you use the nipple they came with.I would recomend putting a silikids silicone sleeve on instead, as these are the only sleeves that we've found that can stay on the bottle through the washing and dry without molding.The silikids sleeves have a large hole in the bottom which allows the water to drain out, whereas the evenflo sleeves have 1/2 cm hole on bottom, which does not allow the water to drain out.Since the water doesn't drain on its own you have to take the sleeve on and off during washing and drying.Before going back to work, I bought the lansinoh pump.My first efforts at pumping with it were incredibly painful, and produced very little milk.It did the trick!Pumping is still not exactly fun, but it's not excruciating, and I can easily pump 10 ounces in 10 minutes.Paired with a hands-free pumping bra, it's a great solution for me.The others just seem to gag him.I breastfeed him and we don't have any issues with nipple confusion and never had a nursing strike.He does take bottles of breastmilk but only from time to time.These are the binkies the hospitals hand out when you give birth and I love them.DS#1 never took a binkie so we weren't sure what to use for our new son but these have been a godsend in the car and for times when he just wants to be cuddled but not eat.My husband and I got a kick out of them because the nipples are hollow, so you can see into your baby's mouth while they are sucking :-)Out of all three, she likes the one with noise (with a spider on it), then the illumination one, then the plain one.But, she does really like them all, but when we put all 3 in front of her on her little bumbo table, she plays with them in that order, usually the one with noise most, but then when we start hitting the other ones for her, she'll move onto them.My 6 month old got this for Christmas.And in the middle of the night I can hear the thing going off for no apparent reason on the floor below.As if that weren't annoying enough, the thing doesn't stay stuck to her high chair.She rips it off immediately each time I put it on.I wouldn't buy this for anyone, it doesn't  work like it's supposed to.Others have mentioned the music can't shut off, but honestly it's not very loud or annoying.It also sticks very well for me.The problem I have with it, is it plays the same song, two different versions of it, but still the same song.Other than that it is pretty good.For these suction cup toys I just use wipe a little condensation off of my water glass because it doesn't take very much moisture to get them to stick.But it doesn't and I am still on the hunt for a good highchair toy.This toy chest is awesome!It will be great for when my baby starts digging in the toy chest herself and doesn't slam her fingers in it.My only wish was that there was like cardboard or a thin piece of plastic in the lid to keep it somewhat sturdy.If you put anything on top of the lid it collapses into the box.It's a decent toy box.I've had mine for maybe around 6 months and it's holding up well to my 2 boys (3 and a half and 19 months.)My oldest has even gotten in it a few times.We got this toy from our registry.After having it for a couple months, I finally gave it to my 5 month old, as she has started teething.The first day I gave it to her, she kinda tried to chew on the wood- fine.Today when I gave it to her, she was chewing on the tail feathers- NOT FINE!I panicked, grabbed the toy from her, then wiped off her mouth with her bib.They are sending me a return envelope so they can do quality control on the dove.I just don't feel like a "natural/environmentally friendly" toy should leak dye.So, I would think twice about buying this item!!I find I have to have many different kinds of grabby/teething toys though because she tends to get bored after a little bit, but I hold them and reintroduce them later in the day and it's all new & fun to her once again.At first i was skepticle about a wooden toy, now that he is teething these are the greatest!He gnaws on the wooden part and seems mildly entertained by the bright colors.He prefers to teethe on these over the refrigerator ones!We gave it to him for Christmas when he was 3 months.Though he wasn't immediately interested, he was soon, and it was the first toy he could really grip and move to his mouth.We like it because it's one of the quietest toys unless there's something hard to hit it against; the crinkle of some of the "tail feathers" provides some interest but is very soft.Certainly it seems more safe than most hard objects.It's brightly colored and easy for little hands to hold.Extremely fast shippingThis is one toy that has absolutely exceeded my expectations.Given, every child is different, and what works for mine may not work for yours - but this has really worked for mine.I purchased this for our son when he was 5 months old.He was immediately attracted to it, and at first it stayed suction cupped to a glass cutting board on the kitchen table.Since then we have stuck it to pans, windows, and the underside of an ottoman as well.He likes to chew on the ring, and the little spinning shapes when he isn't spinning the whole contraption around.Sometimes I put the ring in sideways so he has to spin it from the side.The lighted ball still lights up, and the suction cup still works well.Also, it's gotten immersed in water a few times, and that hasn't stopped the light from working.ANOTHER UPDATE: 15 months and the battery still works, the ball still lights up.I have no idea where the suction cup base is but the toy is now the "go to" car toy.Since it lives in the car now, I also attach it to the shopping cart cover and it gives him something to manipulate other than the groceries on the shelves.To be clear, this no longer engrosses him the way it did when he was an infant, but it has the greatest longevity of any toy so far.Most often we detach it from its base and let him play with it.The base is great to have for high chair or restaurant fun (the actual toy never touches cooties on the table.The suction works well both on our dining table and on a high chair tray.Sure, the babies can pull it off if they really want to, but they do not if they are busy playing with it.The ball that lights up is really nice - well made toy.There is no way to change the battery  inside it, so I hope that it lasts for a while.the newborn plus it means the older passenger has no view-the seat doesn't sit at the proper angle, it's a bit too upright and there is no way to adjust the angle, this may be a problem specific to the seat I haveOverall this works ok and is the only option if you want to use a carrier with this stroller but it has room for improvement.I've purchased four of these now, two I gave as gifts (oh God) and two I kept for us.The ones I kept both worked for about two months, then never worked again.The first one I let the baby hold in bed at night.It would charge during the day and I let it run out at night.That worked about a month, then it wouldn't charge any longer.The second one I was afraid to let the baby sleep with.I unplugged it and let it run all night about two or three nights a week and the other nights I just left it in the base and turned it on.That on lasted about two months before it stopped charging.I've wasted so much money on these.They are really cute when they work, but they are too expensive to be so unreliable.I had two of the older style and the same problem with one of those.This review is based on my initial impression of the product.I understand that some people had problems with the light not holding charge after several months of use, but after a few weeks I have not experienced that yet.The light was easy to unpack and to charge.When he asks me what it is, I am having a bit of the trouble explaining it to him other than saying that it is a toy with a light.He plays with it before falling asleep.He turns it off himself before falling asleep.I like seeing my child enjoying this toy, so I rated it "good".UPDATE (4/21/2010):  For no apparent reason something strange was happening with the toy's switch two days ago and then yeserday it went back to normal.The switch was not functioning as expected.As we pressed it the toy was changing colors not as expected: colors were skipped or the toy would turn off instead of changing color;, the toy would stay on after the switch press that was expected to turn it off.I finally turned it off and the next day it was functioning normally.Makes me wonder about the quality of construction.If you don't find my review helpful, please comment why you think so.It will help me to improve my reviews.We've gone through three of these lights and finally gave up.The first one worked for a few days, then flickered a little for a few hours and died completely.I called to exchange it and had a very difficult time trying to get it exchanged.When the replacement arrived three weeks later (and I had to pay return shipping for the original) the new light lasted almost 3 weeks.Not leaving it on the charging base constantly, allowing the battery to die completely once a week to prevent cell memory, allowing it to charge fully again before use.Okay, we can live without green, no big deal.Two days later blue stopped working.Within a week it would not come on at all anymore.Until day 39.I will NEVER buy another Mobi product.I ended up out $30 bucks for the light, $25 bucks for all the return shipping, countless hours on the phone with the nonexistent customer service dept., and my child was left brokenhearted since he absolutely loved the light when it did work.Great idea, extremely poor execution.The battery lasted well over 12 hours when glowing blue.Part of me wonders if baby drool might have messed with the charging contacts, but I just don't know.We have ordered the KinderGlo Moon light as a replacement.This is a nifty light.The lamp has stayed on over 10 hours on a single charge.There's also a "hidden" feature that if you leave the thing in the charger and the power goes out it comes on.(Unfortunately, it comes on ine th 15-minute auto-off (blue-only) mode so it's not much of an emergency light.The light itself is farily durable.There is a single button on the bottom.You keep pressing it to cycle through the modes.There's also a red led whose sole purpose is to flash when the light is in auto-off mode.When you lift the light from the charger it automatically turns on in 15-minute auto off (blue only) mode.If you're happy with that then you'll never have to touch the button.The problem is the charger.It appears to be a great design.A weighted disk and you drop the light into the center.However, the two contacts on the charger don't always "mate" with the metalic sections under the lamp.One never worked, despite considerable fiddleing.The other has yet to fail.When it does everything becomes useless and I may re-think the rating I gave.Until then my daughter has an interesting light to keep her company as she's falling asleep.I had no idea what this was all about.What a great idea.It's rechargeable and portable.He holds it before bed.I am going to try to use it in the car during night trips.It also makes a great gift idea.It stopped working within one weekWanted to use as fun night light for toddler but it just stopped workingIt is a softer hard rubber, looks cute and lovely colour changes etc.Too bad it was not durableIf they fix that problem, this could be nicePerhaps I just got a"lemon"One can take a chance  as Amazon has a brilliant return/refundBut it HAS to be Amazon for the excellent return policyIn over 6 years we've NEVER had a problem and we order ALL the timeI hope I helped For me , it was awful but mine may have been that 1 in 1000 thatwas a flopI read the negative reviews before buying one from Amazon.And of course, mine stopped working in 3 weeks like many other reviewers.It didn't even work properly to begin with.Total waste of my time on both products.We have been using it with our little girl for most of a year and she went from infant to toddler having this in her crib most nights with no problem.The charge is pretty much a little over one night, but if you drop it in the charger each morning - or make it part of the toddler's 'duties' - it works great.As noted by others it would be nice if you could have the pink color without being in the color cycle mode but it is definitely not the end of the world.got this for my three-year-old daughter.We have it next to her bed.She wont' sleep with it, but she likes it next to her bed.You can set the "blue" mode to turn off after 15 minutes.Okay, if I really wanted to use it as a nightlight I could put it up high, but I'm having enough fun watching them use it as a toy.The Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate is a great idea - a cool, portable light which only requires recharging daily.Further, its utility during power outages as a light source may prove valuable, particularly to individuals living in areas prone to that problem.We have used ours when ascending the stairs at night so we can avoid turning on the hall and stairway lights.This keeps our little one from waking because of the light which manages to seep into his room under the door, but gives off enough light so that no one stumbles on the stairs.The Mobi TykeLight is a five star concept and had everything met other criteria, would have upped my rating on this item.I have had none of the problems experienced by some other reviewers.When the Mobi TykeLight was initially plugged in, it worked immediately while on the base.It does take at least ten hours to charge; and, it seems that initially the length of time the light glows is shorter than later, after several chargings.After ten hours of charging the first time, as directed, when taken off the base the light only worked for about five hours.Our toddler grandson has dubbed it "The Little Man;" he delights in hiding the GloMate.Sometimes his toddler hands have dropped the "Little Man," who nonetheless continues to work reliably evey night.The Mobi TykeLight has proven to be a reliable product which does what it is designed to do.However, it won't truly light a room, but it is better than nothing.I left the thing off teh base AND ON overnight.It was still glowing well after 15 hours off the charger.My one complaint is that the directions say it takes 8 hours to get a full charge.Mine didn't reach full charge status until well after 24 hours.I purchased one of the originals of this product for my daughter when she was around 2 1/2, she's about to turn 6 and still uses "glowy guy" every night even though now he only holds a charge for an hour or two at most.I also love the original charger so much more, you simply put the glomate on the charger and he charges... easy peasy.The new one has to be positioned just right, bumping it can switch the light from red to green or off all together and another bump can cause him to light up when you don't even want it on which drives my daughter crazy.After only one night of having the new glomate she asked to have her "glowy guy" back, saying that she not only preferred his solid pink color (no pink option with the new one, only blue, green, red, or color changing) even if he only stayed on for an hour or two.I wish they still produced the original, I'd buy several!I have a feeling this new mate will be hanging out in his box on a closet shelf for some time to come.it has/had great promise.The first one stopped working after 2 months for no reason.It just would not charge and like other reviewers said something inside was rattling  like it had come loose.Luckily Amazon refunded us - I did not even bother contacting the manufacturer.Our second light broke today.It did fall but if it can't handle a fall what type of portable light is that?I won't ask for a refund since my son did drop it but I feel these are poorly designed and need to be improved.My younger son was devastated when it broke and my older son was crying tonight because he liked carrying it to the bathroom at night.We got the Kinderglo moon that is similar and portable and so far it is excellent.We just ordered another for our older son since they both need night lights still.I do NOT recommend this light.There are lots of options for colors, including one that cycles through all the colors.We've just received this, so I can't yet comment on its longevity, but I'll update my review if it dies an untimely death.I'm hoping Mobi has fixed the problems that have plagued other reviewers.It's hard plastic, not very malleable at all, so I wouldn't exactly call it "cuddly," but it certainly does have personality.My daughter is 6 and still needs a night light.It really helps her to stay in her bed at night.We love that it is protable and be placed in her bed with her.It is a little bit of a pain that we have to remember to charge it every morning, but it is worth the sleep it provides her and us.Great product.on nights she is having a hard time sleeping she takes it off the base and puts it in bed with her.One thing to know when you take it off the base and look at the bottom of it a light will be blinking.that means it will only stay on for a period of time and then go off.If you push the button on the bottom once it will stay on all night.My daughter likes blue.So my problem with these kinds of lights is that they just don't look or feel fire safe to me.The cheap plastic looks like it could melt and I get nervous with open access lightbulbs and switches around little hands.The base plugs into a standard wall outlet and has a cord that allows you to store the base unit high on a shelf.We plugged ours in behind a dresser so you can't even see or get to the cord.The GloMate "guy" sits in the base to charge.Then at night you can lift the figure off its base and it glows bright enough to illuminate a dark room but not so bright that it's distracting.there is a small button on the bottom of the figure that you can press to change the color from blue, to green, to puple, etc... or you can have it automatically cycle through the colors in a rainbow effect.My son will take this figure right into bed with him (again, no cords, batteries, or chokeable items to worry about).There is a dimmer option so the light will fade in 15 minutes.If the power goes out while the unit is on the charging base, the figure will automatically start glowing.Absolutely recommend this nightlight.It was a big hit with my almost 6 year old and with mom and dad too.However, I am skeptical about how long it will last.Both in terms of interest and durability.We have had it for a couple weeks and have only used it a few times and those times were pretty brief.In addition, when we first got it and put it on its charging base the charging indicator light changed from red to green by morning indicating it was fully charged.I now notice that even if we haven't turned the thing on or removed it from the base the charge indicator light is remains red indicating it is charging even though it hasn't been used in days.Trying to sleep with a red light kind of seems like trying to sleep in a night club.The color change mode is too distracting for the kids to fall asleep with as they are anticipating a color change.My kids like to bring it with them under their sheets when they make a "tent"  I'd say this is more of a toy then a nightlight.This light has allowed us to FINALLY turn off the hallway light (can you tell I like to sleep in the dark and haven't done so in over 8 years!)We keep the GloMate in the hallway on a small table and because of the way the rooms are situated, the GloMate is easily accessible to whichever sleep walker needs it.So far we have not had any issue with charging.I look forward to taking GloMate on vacation with us.I'm giving this 5 stars because I think it's a really cute idea for a nightlight, and because ours has worked just fine for us so far.I think it's neat to have a nightlight that older kids can have in the bed with them, and the option to dim after 15 minutes is a smart one.Ours is for our 7-month-old, but I think Amazon really has it miscategorized as a "Baby" item.However, his fascination with it has helped in a few situations where we really wanted to keep him content.There's no reason it couldn't be in a nursery as a nightlight, but I think most babies sleep better without a nightlight.OK it was cute while it lasted, but it just stopped working/charging for no apparent reason after 10 months.Phooey.My preschooler is pretty upset about it.First of all, be careful with night lights.I would hesitate to allow my kids to sleep with it like a doll or teddy bear.The best feature is its 15 minute slow dim to off feature.Any time that you disconnect the light from the base, it will automatically start a 15 minute slow dim to off.That may make it very practical as a night light (if your little one goes to sleep that fast - mine seem to take longer than the light :(Anyway - seems like a fine purchase more as a party favor than a small kids night light - but the 15 minute dim may make the selling point for many.I barely used this for two weeks when the button on the bottom got stuck.The unit still worked however it was on the default blue that shuts off after 15 minutes; I could not change it to any other color nor keep it on indefinitely.I mainly used it when my toddler got up in the middle of the night.The fact that only I used it, not my child, made it more surprising when the button got stuck so soon after I got it.It's not like it's been abused (since you know how children can be rough on things.)I called the company's toll free number to see what could be done and spoke to a live person almost immediately.When I explained what happened the operator got some order information from me and said they will send me a replacement in 6-10 business days.I was very impressed with the level of customer service!Overall, if this second one lasts longer (perhaps I got a fluke) then this is definitely worth getting.I like it better than a night light since I find it difficult to sleep with even a little bit of light on.I also like that it comes on automatically in the event of a power outage.I'll update this review in several months to let you know how the second one pans out.We have a regular Mobi Tykelight that we've used in my daughter's room since she was born, and we love it.My daughter took a shine to this one immediately and was fascinated with how it changes colors, so much so that she took it to bed with her and drifted off to sleep with it tucked under her arm the first night we had it, and does so now almost every night.The slow and steady color-changing is mesmerizing even for me, it's a nice bonus that she enjoys it as well and it helps her transition slowly into sleep mode and wind down from a busy day.The light is very easy to charge by simply placing it on the charging base - you do have to make sure it is sitting securly in the base and make sure the base is completely level.There is a light indicator on the front that lets you know if it's sitting securely and charging correctly.The charge time seems to be plenty long for our purposes - the first night we used it lasted at least 8 hours.Most nights after my daughter is asleep I will carefully slip the light from her bed and place it back in the base so she can use it again the next night.Overall we love this light (as well as the original) - I love that they are portable and rechargable, and sturdy enough to withstand a child's attention.My daughter also likes to sleep with it from time to time.The light does not get hot.It is easy to charge.It is soothing color, is portable in the sense that it has rechargable battery which can be charged by its charging base coming with the light.The battery lasts long time.While it worked.This item seems to be good for about a week and then it just craps out.In our case the lighting unit that's in the bottom and also serves as a charging port just fell out of the item shortly after it stopped working all together.My suggestion would be to stock up on disposable light sticks if you have the problem of your small child being afraid of the dark in the car.Simply designed and very functional.The Glo man sits loosely atop a circular charger, and when he's lifted off of it, he glows.A button on the bottom of the GloMate cycles between one of several colors or the last setting is to periodically rotate between ALL the colors.My one and two-year old love it!In fact, they love it so much that I'd say the fun factor is this night light's only disadvantage.The problem is that the first night they had the GloMate, they wanted to play with it when they should have been going to sleep.I'm sure that the problem will be mitigated when the newness wears off, but I'd say that it's a potential disadvantage over other night lights.Aside from that "issue", this is truly an awesome buy!What a cute little night light.The one problem I have with mine is that it does not come on when you remove it from the base.It will work well for a child since it does not get hot.As with almost anything else designed for kids, you won't know if your kid likes this until you buy it.Lots of kids seem to.Mine, however, is so excited by it that it can't be anywhere near bedtime, but it's great for playtime.He especially loves taking it off the charger, because it immediately lights up.Either way, a design critique:First, in the product description it claims to be "soft to the touch".This thing is hard.When a child bangs it on the ground, it goes 'clack', not 'whump'.It has a sort of matte surface, rather than glassy smooth, but that's a long way from "soft".Second, when it's in 15-minute-fade mode, a little red light on the bottom blinks to tell you that it's in that mode instead of always-on-blue.The little red light is extremely distracting for little eyes.Third, you can only do 15-minute-fade mode in blue.We use a blue light on a timer to tell our son when it's wake-up time, so a blue light at bed time could be confusing for him.)Fourth, while the light is very soft (you can't even tell if it's on if you take it outside, even on a cloudy day), it's not dim.In a dark room, it's downright bright.Some kids will love this, others will hate it.I wouldn't be able to sleep with it on in my bedroom, but then, i'm not afraid of the dark.Fifth, i wish they'd found a better way to set up the contact charger.That'll be a lifesaver some day.Also, as they claim in the product description, it's cool to the touch no matter how long it's illuminated.You don't have to worry about it burning your child.--So far, it's pretty sturdy, having withstood some rough-and-tumble play.I've not verified the 10-hour battery life claims, as i can't put it anywhere that i can see it without my son asking for it, and it's hard to keep an eye on when it shuts off when he's put it behind the sofa or under the bed.Likewise, it'll take some time before i can speak to the battery stamina issue, as we've only had ours for a few days.For us, the TykeLight is a great toy, but a lousy nightlight.Dozens of other parents say it's a great nightlight, though, so if you're in the market for such a thing, this might work well.--A note for people who have trouble charging the TykeLight: After a few weeks of play, our TykeLight required a little jiggling when set on the base to charge.Since i know my kid chews on the TykeLight, i got an alcohol wipe (like they sell in drug stores to clean small injuries) and wiped down the metal contacts on the base and on the bottom of the TykeLight.It charges perfectly again.So, if you have increasing difficulty charging, try wiping down the metal bits on the TykeLight and the base (though do unplug the base first).====RIP, TykeLight.After a few weeks of being a toy instead of a nightlight, poor little TykeLight has given up the ghost.Even when charged for a day and a half until the charge light turns green to say the battery is full, TykeLight won't light up (and after being off the charging base for less than a minute, it takes another day and a half for the indicator to turn green again).He plays with it and it seems indestructible!We keep it on during the night and it provides a night dim glow for the room.It is easy to charge and has a small footprint base so it doesn't take up a lot of room on the dresser.Ours doesn't, so we're returning it.Very disappointed.Not too bright, nice and soft, and the hands made it easy for our toddler to hold it when she woke up in the middle of the night.Several weeks ago, the additional colors stopped working, only blue would turn on.A few days ago, it stopped working entirely.It worked for six months.We really like this light but it needs to be made better, it should certainly last longer than six months.This little light glows green, red, or blue or cycles through a rainbow effect.The only problem was that the first one I got only glowed green or blue, not red.She's more interested in this as a toy, however, as opposed to a night light.It's a little distracting for bed time.It will probably be better when she's a little older.For the younger crowd, I would probably stick to a more traditional night light.Have used this for a few weeks now.It alternates between blue, green, purple, and red.You can choose single colors of have it cycle through them.When taken off the base it will give off the pleasing light for hours.His favorite is green, but he also likes blue.It's a fun little light to have for a small child, and they'll really love it.This little guy is extremely cute - a great toddler-friendly shape.However, he is made out of hard plastic, so don't expect a cuddly friend for them to snuggle in bed with.When I set up the light to charge, I put it on the base and the charging light turned red, indicating that it was charging.Then, when it was done charging in the morning and we went to play with it, discovered that our glowing red light in the toy doesn't work either.The light will just go blank where the red mode should be, and pick up again on blue.I haven't tried to call customer service yet, but will do that and see what they say.The downfall and main reason for my 3 star rating is the unforgivable plastic smell in the light which has not gone away after nearly a month of owning this product.It was quite obnoxious when I removed the toy from its box, enough so that I kept the light from the kids a few days until it was less obvious.If you don't care about the smell then you will likely be pleased at the long battery life and nice colors this light provides.Our kids carry this thing all over the house and drop it with no ill effects.I would love to know if this light is BPA and phthalate free.Matter of fact until I find out this little guy is likely going up on my armoire where they can watch and not handle him.These Thirsties diaper covers work very well.I like that we can get a good fit from the smallest to the largest size in the range given.We do hang them to dry.We will buy more when we need the next size!This is an update:We are now on baby #2 and the covers are still working great.The fit on these covers is much better than any other that we have tried.We like the feel of the fabric, it doesn't feel like plastic.But most of that is on the inside where the cover kept the mess in rather than having an explosion.You do have to be sure that the cloth diaper is tucked inside the cover, any diaper left sicking out is just a wick to the clothing and a direct path to a clothing change.We are ordering a few more covers not because they have worn out but because we have a few too many "girl colors" for new baby boy.I had a number of covers, but the thirsties duo wrap (the on that fits two sizes due to snaps) was the only one that rarely (if ever) leaked.After I got rid of the other covers I tried the origional thirsties cover and loved it even more.This cover never leaks, and washes and dries well.I love these covers.We have yet to have a leak through these covers, when we put them on properly.My husband has a habit of not making sure to cover the cloth diapers (Babykicks Prefolds)completely.So many babies are different, and there's so many covers to choose from when you're cloth diapering.I cloth diaper my baby, and I've tried several different covers.She's 4 months old now, and she's not the skinny legged baby with a big belly.She's always been opposite- with chunky legs and a smaller belly.I like both the Thirsties and Bummis SSW, and I want to let you know what I like about each.Thirsties: 1st of all, they're so easy to wipe out if something gets on the cover.Leg gussets make it where I can just put a prefold in and not worry too much about leaks.On the other hand, leg gussets are just a little tight on her chubby legs so I think I'll have to move up a size before she hits the 18 lbs the smalls are supposed to go up to.Still no problems with leaks, but I do make sure to get the prefold on just right and with an absorbant liner so that helps.The downfall with the SWW is not in the lack of leg gussets but with the mesh type lining inside.Just think about your baby's shape and size when getting covers.Or you can just do like I did and get one of each- there's pros to both brands so you can't go too wrong, and then when you have your favorite you can get some more of whichever that is.Only leak if we wait a long time to change her (if she's sleeping or something).I love thirsties diaper covers.They have leg gussets that keep the mess in.I have never had a leak with them.The only thing that keeps this cover from being perfect is that the velcro wears out quickly.The color variety and texture of the diaper covers are are great.The front inner flap to guard against rash and leaks works well and is soft.The cover is not too bulky, making it easy to dress the baby.The leg holes are shaped in a way that covers a portion of the thigh, even when pulled back.This can be good to prevent leaks, but bad because it leaves a larger surface susceptible to rashes.The inner "flap" of the leg holes does well at containing feces, however, urine escapes easily, before the cloth diaper is wet enough to warrant changing.Cloth diapers commonly leak more than disposables, but this cover leaks a bit more than average.The velcro tabs don't latch well.My son squirms and kicks just about the entire time he is awake, and many times the diaper will simply come undone and fall off, leaving everything covered in urine.The only way to keep his diaper on is by dressing him in a onsie.The price of the diaper covers is a little high for someone on a budget.It's much better to purchase adjustable covers with snaps.Though the cost more, they cover a wider weight range, ultimately saving money.I purchased 6 of these covers for my daughter.They advertised that they fit a baby from 6 pounds, but I found that they didn't fit until she was 6 lbs 9 ounces.She is slim, but the covers fit her well.I use a combo of prefolds and fitteds.She is breastfed and sometimes has some quite explosive poo, but she has NEVER had a blowout with these covers.Also, she has never had a leak.I've never had such great results with disposables or any other diaper cover.The covers also hold up very well.They have already been washed many times in the regular cycle, and my washer can be hard on clothes.I'd imagine that these could last through a few babies.I have already ordered more of these covers for when my daughter outgrows her current covers.These were the ONLY brand that I ordered again after trying a couple other brands.He was 22 inches and 9 pounds, 11 ounces at birth... not a small baby.The cover doesn't fit well, but I can't say I blame it necessarily.He's not a chunky baby for his weight, and the legs fit nicely in the gussets, but the cover doesn't seem to accommodate a nicely quilted, high quality organic cotton pre-fold very well with that much baby inside it.I've discovered I'm not as fond of the all PUL construction as I am of the cloth-covered PUL.With the plastic lining on the inside, I can just wipe it clean if there's a leak (my other GroBaby diapers have a cloth mesh lining that cannot be wiped clean) so a plus for thirties.Only annoying thing is the cloth trim that others have mentioned.An excellent economical workhorse for the cloth diaper stash.I'm not sure how it'd fit a 5-pound baby: ours was almost 9 and it's hard to get the closure tight enough around his legs, but maybe our little one has skinny legs.But ... it keeps the poo off the clothes, it keeps the clothes dry, it washes well enough, it's easy to put on, and it's fantastically economical.It does wipe clean if just wet, very well.I've had no issues with the laminate inside being against his skin, it isn't sticky or weird.The edging is very soft, I just wish it weren't white: within a few days they all had yellow poo spots on them, and we don't have time or chemical tolerance to be super-treating them every time we wash.I have four, and we wash every other day -- with 3 Imse Vimse wool covers, I'm never short on covers.I love these diaper covers!They are my fav out of all the others I have tried.I just wish they were cheaper is my only thing.This is my favorite diaper cover so far.Love the gussets and the way the hook and loop tabs extend over the wings.Also reinforced with a second layer of PUL where the hook and loop tape is sewn on.I would recommend these to anybody who is looking for a good diaper cover.We have a Vista stroller (also by Uppababy) so maybe we're biased, but we really like this stroller.As we were planning what to pack, my husband came to the realization that it might be a tight fit for the Vista and all the other stuff we needed for us and the baby in our car.Couldn't believe he thought of it first, but I immediately started to research strollers.I also wanted one that reclined.I really liked the fact that the g-luxe had such a huge sunshade and I liked the look of it as well.Also, the maclaren recall made me a little nervous.I had him take it back.I called around and found a retailer near our destination that had the 2010 model, so we picked it up when we got there before going to the hotel.I had no problems pushing the stroller one-handed.I augmented the storage by putting my purse (2nd diaper bag) over the handles.The stroller did not tip back with the extra weight (probably about 5-6lbs.).We have no complaints at this point and feel we gave the stroller a pretty good workout over the 4 days we had it on the trip and since.I only wish we could've waited for the blue one (Harrison).Since we needed it right away we had to go with the black (the color the store had).At our recent trip to Disney we literally looked around and realized how superior our stroller was to most of the ones we saw.Living in Florida, the sun sheild was a HUGE selling point for us, and the fact that it reclines allowed our daughter to nap when she got too tired without having to go back and forth to our hotel.I love this sheet but if I had to do it again, I probably wouldn't buy it.I'm giving it 4 stars because as a product itself - its perfect and it fits the mattress completely fine.Its just way too much money to pay for a sheet and of course with my first child, I was paranoid about making sure the sheet fit perfectly.However, I found that the porta crib cotten jersey sheets by American Baby company fit perfectly as well.Its a bit of a tighter fit but they eventually mold into the shape.This sheet does the trick for the bjorn travel crib.Maybe if I had read that one-star review first I would have just used my normal crib sheets and saved the money.It is soft and fits snugly.The way it hooks on the side of the Babysitter is a bit awkward, although I don't think it will hurt the baby - one side seems to never fit in the slot.It might have been better to make a removable toy hanger so you can put your own toys on it?Plus it's outrageously expensive - and what's up with the choking hazard if it's a toy for kids under two (the chair only accommodates kids up to 2).I hope the baby likes it when she gets older.I know this piece if very expensive.But I personally think it's worth the money.First of all, it's very well made.Not a cheap plastic toy.The toy is also well designed to help with child's development.First, she would use her fist to hit the pieces to rotate them, probably more of a reflex.She is very into it whenever she plays it.Good investment.BTW, my DD is 3 months old.which for some reason I assumed it would be.Baby doesn't seem to be too interested in it.I use it more as a bar to prop her other toys on.Maybe she'll like it more when she's a bit bigger.She likes to rest her arms on it though when she's in the sitter....so I guess thats pretty good.My 3-month-old son loves this wooden toy.While he is content to sit in his BabyBjorn Babysitter Balance chair with or without this toy, he definitely has a lot of fun playing with it and we, his parents, have a lot of fun watching him!The toy attaches easily onto the Babysitter Balance chair, stays secure while on, and comes off in a snap.Great toy!Cute idea but not worth the price!It's not adjustable and doesn't stay on well.It's cute and I love that it's mostly wood and no overstimulating lights or bad quality music so I still give 3 stars!If you're going to buy it do it when baby is young and only bring it out once in a while.I liked this toy bar.It was easy to clamp onto the chair and it stayed in place.And baby took right to it.His hands fell right at the right place and he started playing right away.I really like the Baby Bjorn products.Even though they seem to be a little more expensive, the quality is worth it.The toy is not entirely wooden.I wish I knew sooner about this product.We kept swaddling him when he completely outgrew the blanket, and it was getting harder and harder.I ordered online some sack from Australia where the baby could stretch his arms, but could not take them out.The sack did not work.The baby could not sleep in it.And we have a good sleeper that goes straight for 12 hours of sleep at night.Then I saw this product recommended at some forum for babies with eczema, and I ordered two.The baby slept in it from the first time with no problem.He had some flexibility so his arms probably did not fall asleep, and he would wake up always happy!My 5 week old baby is colicky & a jerker.The stretchy fabric is TOO stretchy and doesn't hold my baby in enough -- that is the purpose of swaddling right?!I can identify w/the reviewer who said her baby's head looked like it was attached to a bag of angry kittens!!On the Woombie website, it suggests giving your baby a few days to get used to a different method of swaddling but honestly, how much longer can I torture an already sleep-deprived child?!In addition, the zipper is PLASTIC!!I have never seen a cheaper looking piece of plastic crap in my life and it definitely adds to the struggle of trying to zip your squirmy baby up!I guess I'll have to stick to my swaddling blankets.I have very mixed feeling about this pacifier.On one hand, it has a cap, which is so convenient that words can't describe it, on another hand, my baby does not hold it in her month for too long ad spits it out due to its shape I believe.Also, the fact that it is clear doesn't help in locating it, the bigger sizes offer options with a colored center, so that gets better, but the shape doesn't.I tried born free pacifiers, and those worked like a charm with my baby, who always takes them and does not spit them out.The only thing I think would have been great is a lid to cover it.so far so good.I don't comment on the quality of things like this--what do you expect for under ten bucks?It will last through his infancyI'm always putting wet washcloths on the edge to dry before they go in the hamper and it's never off balance from the weight.The mesh sides also help any damp clothes air out.The handles are durable and make it easy to carry a full hamper to the washer.And it holds a ton of clothes.I bought this when I was pregnant with my now 4 month old.If you notice in the picture how it's flat and then rounded at the corners.I can't get the thing to sit straight no matter what I do.And as I fill it I feel like it gets more and more crooked and just keeps leaning.It's frustrating from that point, and I know it's not something I'll use long term because I can't stand that.But, its cute and it looks nice in the nursery, other than the leaning factor.And it holds plenty.It's very roomy.Our daughter is facinated by the bee puppet in the Baby Einstein videos.It is her favoriate go to toy.She enjoys taking it off the base and being able to use it as a teether or rattle it about.it was really hard to find a mirror that worked well for the captain's chairs in my minivan, but this was the solution!It's hard to tell in the pictures, but this mirror is basically made up of two parts- the base, which has two easily adjustable straps and clips to wrap around the headrest, one over the top/bottom and the other on the sides.Then this base has the mirror on a stiff swivel that can be adjusted in a LARGE range of angles.Very much worth the money, especially if you are using captains chairs in a minivan!Oh, and this mirror doesn't distort the way others do, it's a very clear view of your baby!Mirror allows clear view of baby with minimal distortion.Some distortion has to be expected with a nonbreakable mirror.But I can clearly see baby and what he's up to.I can't imagine a better mirror.This is the second mirror I tried.This mirror is rigid, so you can see your baby clearly.My only complaint is that the swivel thing you use to adjust the mirror is very stiff, so it's hard to move it in small increments.To get it to "break free" you have to push it so hard that it then pushes all the way to that side.Maybe it has to be that way so it doesn't bounce out of adjustment while you're driving though...Otherwise I am very happy with this mirrir and my baby is happy he can see mommy while we're driving.This is my little one's first favorite toy!I hook it to her play gym and I've hooked it to her car seat when we took a long trip.It really kept her entertained!At first she loved to stare at it, now she's plays with it and chews on it some.I would definitely recommend this or any similar toy from Lamaze!The back of the wings are black and white, which is good for newer babies, but the patterns and colors on the rest fascinate her now as well.I think this toy will definitely grow with her.I wanted a nice roomy playpen for my daughter to play in since our teeny apartment is not babyproofed.Its HUUUGE compared to the others on the market.I like that the walls are see through so she can see mommy and not feel so isolated.It was a cinch to put up and put away in less than 2 minutes (tho I can see how it might be a challenge to others, there is a bit of a trick to putting the walls down).It did have a bit of a strong smell fresh out of the box, but we aired it out over night before putting the baby in there and it's been fine.The wheels make it easy to move off to one side when we're not using it but don't want collapse it.The floor is comfy for her to play and sleep on.Sometimes I use the playpen without the sheet.Besides that I love this this thing.I also have a joovy high chair and stroller, I really like this company.The only drawback has been the rotten smell of the fabric as soon as it was taken out of the packaging, (which smells similar to dried vomit in my opinion).After 3 months of "airing out" I had hoped that the smell would go away but it persistently lingers.Overall this is a decent product but I recommend that it be used outdoors or throughly cleaned with soap and water before use.As as amendment to my previous statement, I would like to say that I contacted Joovy Customer Service through their website and notified them about the smell of the play yard.Joovy was proactive and helpful in correcting this mishap and sent me a replacement product that didn't smell.Thank You Joovy!Set up was a breeze.Product seems very sturdy.Did not notice a funny odor, as others mentioned.We like how it includes a sheet to cover the bottom.The bottom doesn't seem to be too hard.Don't know how easy it is to take down as we have it permanently in corner of a room...Large space for playing, solid construction, wheels to make it mobile without heavy lifting, and meets expectation.Good product.Did not smell as stated by others.btw, easy as pie to set up.I can make 6 bottles or more at once!Also, my baby takes Similac Sensitive RS, that has rice starch in it and I read that it was difficult to mix, but not with this pitcher!!!This product rocks!I mix up her fomula once a day and sit it in fridge.It saves me so much time.My baby had gas problems and we also had a problem with her formula clumping.I have no clumping and her gas has almost gone away completely.This jug was so useful that I will probably buy another one, but I am pretty mad at how cheaply made it is.The little bobble that holds the handle on snapped off after about 3 weeks.I tried to glue it back on, but it wouldn't stay.Too bad, it really mixes the formula well and is a time saver.We have 2 of these, 1 in use and the 2nd soaking at all times!As long as you don't get overzealous with the mixing motion, you should only get a small amount of bubbles in your formula.Great product.This pitcher is a lifesaver.We found that the formula was impossible to dissolve quickly without shaking vigorously.This caused bubbles which of course causes gas.The pitcher dissolves all of the formula without causing "froth".Bought this as new mom to help with formula.It works like a charm...blending and mixing.I can't imagine mixing formula any other way.Wish it were a little larger pitcher, but again, works like a charm and makes mixing a breeze.Not only do you get up-and-down mixing, but the plunger spins, so it's really easy to mix formula and not get any lumps!I wish I would have bought this before I spent two months shaking bottles.I purchased this stroller when I was about 8 months pregnant with my second.I am only 5'2" and about 130 lbs.I found it slightly difficult to steer and push up or down hills.My toddler is about 30 lbs and my little one is about 12 lbs.I love the look of the stroller and it steers and handles very well with only one child.It is very easy to fold and light weight.The cup holder is terrible, don't waste your money.It falls apart all the time.We're expecting our second baby and we needed a new stroller.We were looking for a stroller that would at least have a rumble board and preferably also a second seat.We briefly considered the B-Ready but I didn't like that there wasn't a roller board attachment.Our first child will be 2.5 when the new baby is born and I imagine we'll be using a roller board even more than a second seat, especially when he's over 3.The decision really came down to the Uppababy Vista, the Bugaboo Chameleon, or the City Select.I liked the expansion possibilities but that stroller is much longer than the Uppababy.The BOB is also a long stroller (although not as long as the City Select) and I really wanted something that would be more maneuverable in the city.I was really hoping for something that could do both.The next to go was the Bugaboo.I didn't like how hard it was to fold the Bugaboo, which was also a problem I had with the BOB.But it was really in comparison to the Uppababy that the Bugaboo lost out.The chair of the Uppababy is noticeably higher than the Bugaboo.I would say the Uppababy is probably the tallest stroller of all the ones we looked at with the exception of the Stokke.My son tried out the rumbleseat in the store and liked sitting in it.This is really a big deal because I fold and unfold the stroller more than I would have thought - getting it in and out of the car, storing it at daycare, storing it at a restaurant, etc.Now that I've had the stroller for a while I like it even more.I wouldn't have thought this would be as big a positive to me as it is.It is so easy to run errands with this stroller.I can fit bags of dry cleaning or bags of groceries easily under the stroller with no problem.I had worried buying the Vista because of previous reviews about the wheels not handling well over uneven sidewalks.All of the sidewalks I use the stroller over are brick and some are very, very uneven.For the last 6 months we've had no problems with the redesigned wheels.And for an older baby the 0 degree recline is great.I also like how many configurations there are for the seat and how easy it is to make changes to the seat quickly on the go.So now that I've gone on and on about how much I love the stroller, I'll talk about why I gave the stroller 4 instead of 5 stars.The major problem I have with the stroller is the brake.This was also redesigned for 2010 but I don't recall from looking at the stroller earlier what it was like in previous versions.When I step on the brake it doesn't engage automatically so some or all of the wheels can turn a quarter turn after I've engaged the brake.What also makes it confusing is there isn't any indicator to let you know if you've engaged the brake or not.I think the inability to know quickly and reliably if the stroller is secured is a real problem.It's also very irritating if I take the stroller on the subway and want it to stay that it can roll a foot or so from where I engage the brake before the brake engages.In small spaces I want the stroller to stop where I put on the brake.I've also had similar problems in parking garages.The problems aside, I think this is the best, most flexible, and most adaptable stroller on the market.We splurged on this stroller.The 2010 vista was the answer for us.The baby has lots of room.2) the push- so easy to push, I don't feel like I am fighting the stroller.The wheels can really take almost any sharp turn no problem3) the flexibility- we used the bassinet and the car seat adaptor for the first 3 months.We also brought this into friends houses too and used it for the same purpose.Very, very handy.The seats (bassinet, toddler seat, car seat adaptor) all pop in and out of the frame so easily.A very nice feature that we have used a lot.4) the sunshade- this might be what made us decide to buy.It's on both the bassinet and the toddler seat.Unfortunately, the sun always finds ways to peek through any little hole so I did have a little blanket with me a lot but I know that this stroller gives the best sun protection out there.5) the basket - ok this may be the feature that made us buy this stroller...the basket is HUGE.The way it is designed you can get a ton of stuff in there.It's even easier to access when using the car seat adaptor instead of the stroller seats.I actually put my baby in his car seat in the stroller and use it to do my grocery shopping, the basket fits most of my groceries (granted I'm not doing "stocking up shopping" but it definitely does hold a lot of stuff.)6) the rear axle - this is another genius design feature.The rear bar is shaped like an upside down "U" so you don't kick it while walking7) Easy fold and open.I think the open could possibly be done with one hand but I haven't mastered that yet.We actually got caught in chilly weather one night and put the leg rest all the way up and reclined the seat all the way back, and pulled out all the sun protection.Should have listened.I often run into things (doors, shelves/displays in stores, walls, etc) because I forget that the stroller is now wider where the cup holders are.They are also pretty flimsy (made with chains) which is supposed to help prevent spills but the jury is still out on that one.Even my 27oz Klean Kanteen is a bit top heavy in it.Yet a starbucks coffee cup seems too short.I don't get it.2) There is nowhere to put mommy stuff.One thing I do like is the streamlined look of the stroller but it would be nice to have a place to stash my cell phone, putting it right at my fingertips.The storage basket has little pockets that I think are meant for this but if the phone rings, assuming you hear it down there, you have to stop strolling and dig through the basket to get it.It would be much more convenient if there was a little place for it up top on the push handle.I think you can get something "after market" but it would be good for uppa baby to design something here.We took my 4 month old to disney.Let me say, if i had a dollar for every time I said how much I love my stroller, well, I might have been able to pay for the stroller!This thing rocked!We used the disney bus system and had no problem getting on and off the buses.yes, our stroller is much bigger than those little umbrella ones and it does take a few more seconds to fold than those, but all the other positives totally outweigh that for me.The only issue I had was that you have to fold strollers which meant taking out everything from the basket.I'm sure everyone has to do this but since our stroller basket is so big, it was a lot of stuff we were taking out!So between the 2 of us we had to carry on the bus the stroller, diaper bag, bag with my breast pump and cooler, shopping bags, sweatshirts, blankets, cups from the cupholders and oh yeah, the baby!And I had NO problem finding my husband and the stroller.The height of the seat also makes it convenient to roll the stroller right up to a table so that baby was essentially sitting with us and not on the ground.Highly recommend the car seat adaptor for this stroller as it gives you another option.Especially if you are running a quick errand and the baby has fallen asleep in the car seat, you don't have to wake him just to put him in the stroller seat, just use the car seat and he stays sleeping!Cupholders- reviewed aboveVista Travel bag - we have the new one, with the wheels built in.This is a fantastic stroller, definitely worth every penny, as it is a bang for your buck.I have used it about 5 times a week for the past 3 months after tossing my old Chicco Cortina stroller.It was fine,but so bulky, and not very good on maneuvering as this one is... plus it looks much nicer then the ChiccoOverall the design, weight, and price is what is so attractive about this stroller.One note of caution however, DO NOT buy the cup holder accessory, you can check out my review on amazon for that.Trust me!Other then that this is the best luxury brand stroller you can get for the money.Other strollers you have to buy each part separately this one comes with everything!Also the best basket on a stroller hands down, when you're shopping you'll appreciate how large it is.It gives us the ability to sleep well at night without worrying our baby is going to die of SIDS.If it ever had to do the first vibration the light on it blinks orange instead of green so you know it went off.I would definitely recommend this product for new parents!Totally worth the money!i use these on a daily basis to have the formula pre-measured and can just untwist, dump and shake for a quick bottle at room temperature.the only reason i put down 4 stars is that sometimes they don't want to "twist" on real well so you have to try a couple times to get the threads lined up right.i think they'll be worn out by the time we get through the bottle and the feeding stages.What's pictured is what I ordered but not what I received.These show patterned pieces, mine are plain.They came in a bucket that they will not fit back into, which is dumb, but I guess since they're bath toys I wouldn't store them in the bucket anyway.Just a little lame that I'd have to puzzle piece them into the bucket if I wanted to store them there.The V's and A's look really similar, minus a cut out for the As and the W's and M's are the same.these aren't as cool as they look.::EDIT:: we have used them in the bath, they stick fine.My son gets the 4s As and Vs mixed up because they are all very similar.This is a great play mat.My 8 week old has been enjoying the mat for several weeks now and LOVES the lights & sounds.The only flaw is the mat isnt very thick or padded.For the hefty price tag this mat should be thickerThis mattress is strudy, has a wipeable suface so that clean up after a "accident" is a breeze.In my experience it doesn't seem to absorbe smell so it doesn't smell after you wipe it off with plain water.It fits my divinci crib very snuggly.I researched mattresses and decided on this one.They also sold this mattress at Sears but it cost on sale about $15 more than what I got it for at Amazon.sleeps well on it.Once they transition to toddler I'd say get a new mattress.-When I first used it, I hated that it was unbreathable and plastic coated, especially during the hot months.It fits snugly in the crib and my daughter sleeps very well on it.I do know have anything else to compare it against but I would recommend to others since my daughter likes it.The mattress is not super hard, has a little softness to it but not too much.Update - Jan 2012, mattress is superior.my daughter is now a very active 2.5 year old and jumps on it nightly and it has held up very well.I ordered 3 packs of these for my daughter's clothes, and I am very pleased with the product.I have quite a few baby hangers from a number of different brands, and these are the sturdiest.I've had others snap as manufacturer's seem to think little clothes need flimsy hangers.They're thick, a good shape, have slots for clothing with straps, and are sturdy enough that I can use clothespins to hang 5 skirts from one hanger with no problem :)Some reviewers have complained about the lack of color choice... seriously, who cares?!Its a hanger.It will be 95% covered by the clothes you stick on it.I received both pink and blue hangers.Do I care that my daughter has blue hangers?I even dress her in blue sometimes.There's no such thing as a color that isn't gender neutral.Best baby hangers I've seen anywhere.My girl's clothes are 18 months- 2T and they fit well.We really like Dr. Brown's design.Sadly, our LO won't take to the narrower nipple and design.The narrower neck also means harder mixing (if you are using powder)My daughter would spit up all the time we though it was the formula and changed it.WOW!I would say in less then 48hr my daughter was fine on just about any formula.We learned the hard way, don't wash these by hand.It's a pain!We have only had to replace the nipple level as our child grows.We have NEVER had a problem with the bottles leaking.As long as you don't exceed the fluid level on the bottle you should not have a problem.They really do reduce gas and colic symptoms.They can be a nuisance to wash, but I would rather put up with washing them, than put up with my sweet baby crying over gas!You will not find a set like this with as many accessories at this low of a price anywhere else.Got Dr. Browns due to recommendations from at least 3 friends whose opinions I trust...so cute.I haven't had any problems with leaking except when I travel, now I use the travel closed tops instead of all the inserts/cap.I just take the inserts/cap in a ziploc.Husband gave her the 1st bottle at 2.5 wks, and she took!Also, my lactation consultant says that these bottles are a faster-flow bottle.She says it in a bad way, as though slower is always better, but I don't think fast is necessarily a bad thing if your own letdown is strong (like mine) and your baby prefers a stronger stream.I like that these bottles fit my medela pump, so at least I can use them for milk collection and storage, but my baby won't take them.For whatever reason, she prefers the medela bottles.I know some of the babies there love the Dr. Browns, so perhaps the won't go to waste.We have yet to have any gas issues (we've been using them for 3 months).We have also had no leaking problems.I've had to buy some replacement parts b/c there's so many nooks to clean that sometimes I just don't get to them all and little bits grow mold so I have to buy new parts.I haven't tried any other bottles so I don't have anything to compare it to.These bottles are the best baby supply we have!The best feature is Dr. Brown's bubble-reduction device.The bottles are graded in ounces and mililiters, which is very nice for precisely tracking consumption.I highly recommend Dr. Brown's bottles, and also the dishwasher kit.Initially I had purchased one Dr. Brown's set and one Philips Avent set.The PA set leaked so badly within the first week I got rid of them and bought another Dr. Brown's set and have never looked back.This netting is very thin and the elastic is not very stretchy.The thin is good if you have a warm room but the elastic will not stretch to fit over my daughter's play yard.It is simply a waste of money and too much netting to use on her car seat and stroller.I have used this to cover the Pack-n-play outside to keep bugs off and I also can throw a receiving blanket over it for a shade cover that remains off the baby so we can stay out longer, he's protected and there's plenty of air flow to keep him cool.I have also been able to use it as a bug cover, shade cover and older brother protection while in the stroller too!I am glad I made this purchase.I bought this to keep the cats out of my baby's crib, but it turns out that taking it off and putting it back on every time I want to lift the baby out was just too much of a pain, so instead I keep the bedroom door closed.I rated it three stars because it's not a bad product, but it is inconvenient and unnecessary for my needs.Great high chair.My 5 month old seems secure in the harness.I like that the top part of the table snaps off so it can be washed separately or thrown in dishwasher.It was easy to put together...took me about 15 minutes.You basically just snap 3 large pieces together.I had researched several safety knobs before settling on this one.We've had it for over 6 months and my toddler has not figure out how to get pass any door that has it.This product has foiled visitors from teenagers to our grandmothers.Also, it goes well with the rest of the enchanted forest decor.I purchased this because I purchased the matching bedding set.The sound it makes is kind of cheap and tinny, not to mention loud and startling.The baby loves to look at it and now that she's a bit older I let her bat at the animals.It's not something I would turn on to sooth her to sleep, though.I began using the Medela Classic hospital grade pump 2 days after my son was born and had HORRIBLE PAINFUL problems (i.e.After switching to the Symphony all of my problems stopped immediately after the initial healing time was over.I pump exclusively and bottle feed my son due to latching issues and I've been using the pump 8-10 times a day for the last 3 months without a single problem with the mechanics of the machine or it's ability to express a lot of milk.Of course, the pump cab make a difference in how much milk you produce to a certain extent, but it's different for everyone woman so be wary of people who claim that certain pumps will solve your low production issues.PROS:-Extrememly quiet compared to the Pump in Style, Lactina, and Classic pumps-Easy to clean-Exchangable flanges if you need different sizes-Replaceable parts (although I've never needed to replace any of them so far)-Easy to use buttons, fool proof-Double phase expression starts off slow to ease you into full pumping action which is softer on your nipples-Cute!-You can pump both sides at once.CONS:-It's not easy to lug around and can be a bit heavy.It comes in a huge hard case for protection since it's a pricey pump.Not conducive to travel even with the battery pack since it's heavy.I would never take it on the airplane with me.-Condensation often builds in the tubes, but they are easily fixable by running the pump without the bottles attached everyone once in a while-Expensive!You can rent this pump from a hospital which is definitely worth it if you are planning on pumping often.If you experience mechanical problems or you aren't satisfied you can simply return it for another one since you don't own it.I am paying $60 a month for this pump and it's worth every penny.I highly recommend this pump.It has not failed me yet.For your sanity, buy a bra designed for hands-free pumping or take an old sports bra or padded bra and cut slits for the flanges to slide into.Being hands free will save you!Unlike some of the other pumps, these flanges come off you can clean them and insert them into your bra easily.I put a sheepskin mattress cover over it (for comfort and coziness), and then topped that with the cutest cotton sheets from The Company Store and our daughter (now four months old) just loves it.I got this over a month ago.The mattress seems good to me.This is a decent mattress for the price.I'm glad it is made without the icky chemicals.Despite having a small eating surface, the tray-plate combois bulky and inconvenient to store, as it doesn't nest with or fill the same space as any other plates.The non-skid surface will prevent hockey-puck-like slides across a table, but doesn't stop the plate from being pushed around.Our son has certainly never noticed the "Happy face" cutout in the tray - he's too busy throwing things around.In my opinion, a much better buy would be a simple, round plate made of a safe plastic.This Skip Hop plate is made of recyclable-no.-5, which I believe is a safe plastic.This product has helped give him some independence from his momma to be able to feed himself.This product sticks well enough that he can find the edge with his hand and then get inside the bowl with ease.This is a fantastic produce for kids working on self-feeding.And it cleans up easily as well.I washed both quilt and fitted sheet before putting them on the crib and they appear to have survived wash number one very well.Before ordering the set I had been unable to find out exactly what was included in the set.The following is a list of the included:-1 crib quilt-1 piece bumper pads-these are of the thin (not too fluffy) variety that secure to the top and bottom of the crib rails.I went with the SkipHop Hare Grooming set because our nursery's theme is bunnies in shades of mint green and chocolate brown, so it fit the decor, and because it got very good reviews from other parents on various websites.Plus, a lot of the more basic hair sets seemed to be cheaply made, harsh for a baby's delicate skin and hair or just plain ugly.Seems like an easy set to clean, although my only hang-up (and its a minor one) is that the set can't be tucked away somewhere small, its more of the type of thing you leave on the dresser for people to see, and it just seems a little clunky to me.The same set is available at Babies R Us but only in orange and I preferred the green- no difference in price at the time.(The only thing I think may be an issue is the mirror possibly getting scratched since it is on the bottom of the holder and comes in contact with the dresser surface.I'll just have to wait and see.Can be used as a toy or teether, as well as a grooming set, and seems pretty easy as far as maintenance.Overall, I give it 4 stars and I hope that the baby enjoys it as much as I do.**UPDATE** 8/15/2012My daughter will be 2 in October and we are still using this set every day!In fact, she looks forward to me brushing her hair after her bedtime bath and she loves brushing my hair with this set.Its been so easy to clean and use!I just run the pieces under hot water and use a little soap if needed, and let them air dry.Quality is the same as the day it arrived- no cracking, worn edges or loose bristles- even the mirror is intact and unscratched.Only issue is that the bunny base was placed on something sticky by someone at one point and now the edge around the mirror is coated with this slightly pink crust that won't come off but the mirror is unaffected.As a mirror though, we don't use it- too clunky for my daughter to use that way.Just what I needed!Baby likes the mirror too!Got this set a few months ago after getting tired of always searching for a comb.These mats are great, my son spits up a lot yet and this makes it much easier to clean up.The colors are much bolder in person, and children who visit my home often run straight to this little guy and immediately give him a hug.I thought this was pretty well-priced for a stuffed animal and definitely worth buying for little ones.The price is a fantastic deal for a stuffed animal of this size and uniqueness.Just in case.We carefully researched baby carriers.This had the best reviews, widest weight range (7-45 lbs), included the infant insert, allowed for front and back carry, and seemed to be the best for couples of different heights (I'm close to 5 ft and my husband is over 6 ft).We have not been disappointed.Our baby is content for hours in this and we took her to her first outdoor "concert" at Ravinia this summer in the Beco.I have never had any aches or strains from using it and I use it 3-4 days a week for several hours at a time.I also have a ring sling and it kills me after 10 minutes.The Beco washes up well, too (cold water, line dry).My only complaint is that we seem to have difficulty adjusting the shoulder straps when the carrier is on.It almost needs to be threaded (if that makes sense) to adjust it.I would whole-heartedly recommend this carrier.It is worth the money and I am sure we will be using it with our next child, too.I found that once your infant becomes a little larger, the infant insert actually causes more strain on your shoulders.The extra panel limits how low you can rest the waist band on your hips.I'm only 5 ft 2 in, and found to make the shoulder straps comfy, I had to put the waist band slightly below my belly button instead of on my hips, so baby's weight was not on my hips as I prefer.Plus, I found that trying to mount baby on my back already in the carrier/insert and swinging her on my back was really unstable and unsafe.It's actually much more secure to put baby on your back and flip the carrier over her and not vice versa...imagine swinging a 25lb squirmy backpack on your back while trying to keep it totally upright...once you get one arm through and baby is hanging, it's really hard to get the other strap on!One other alternative to the Ergo is the Boba carrier.I don't have it, but is lighter weight and has a higher back than the Ergo...the two main features that are relative negatives of the Ergo.I bought the Beco a little over a week ago.He's a wee one, about 14 lbs, but long.He's always loved being worn.We have an Ergo and love it too.Before I bought the Beco I researched several of the SSC's and here is how I compare the Beco to the Ergo-The Beco is made out of a less stiff fabric than the Ergo.It has a removable hood, whereas the Ergo does not.The biggest difference is the inside flap on the Beco that allows you to put the baby in before putting the carrier on.The Beco is also a little more narrow than the Ergo, making it a better fit for a smaller person like me (5'1"), than the Ergo which has become my husband's carrier (he's 6'2").The Beco also comes with an infant insert that is basically another removable flap that fits inside the carrier, as opposed to having to buy an extra insert for the Ergo.The thing I like least about the Beco (vs. the Ergo) is that I can nurse discretely, without a problem in the Ergo, but it's much more difficult in the Beco.The hood that snaps onto the front and fits over the baby's head is pretty narrow as compared to the one on the Ergo and provides no real cover for nursing.The greater issue is the inside flap- though awesome for putting babies on our back, it fits tight against your chest and is virtually impossible to move so as to allow you to nurse.Overall, though, I really love my Beco!I absolutely love this carrier!I wish I'd had it when my daughter was a newborn.I have the Scooters print, and it's probably one of the cutest baby carriers out there.Technically, it's his carrier, but I "borrow" it all the time).We use it instead of a stroller, and actually gave our stroller away after getting this.Crowded shopping malls, Disneyland, beaches, buses, airports, you name it.We've tried it, and the Beco made it so easy.It took us a few weeks to get used to the internal harness panel (not to be confused with the infant insert, which is what allows you to wear a smaller baby in an ergonomically correct position) because we'd learned to use an older Beco that didn't have it.You can either put the carrier on, and then put baby in, or you can put baby in the carrier and then put them both on.For the reviewer who complained that swinging baby on your back while already in the carrier is not secure, you can put baby in the carrier on your front, and then slide him or her to your back.You don't have to swing baby in the carrier onto your back.I prefer the Beco to the Ergo because the back is higher.My daughter likes to lean back when she's on my back, and the high back of the Beco keeps her from being able to lean very far, so our center of gravity stays close to my body.With a lower back (the back of the Ergo comes well below her shoulders at 8 months), she can lean very far back, which pulls our center of gravity much farther away from my body, making it much harder for me to keep my balance without leaning forward or hunching.This product is one of the few baby items that I could not get along without.We have two so we can keep one in the car, and one in the house.I don't have to worry about lugging around a heavy infant carseat, germs in the shopping cart, keeping my daughter from pulling things off the shelves, how to get my chores done with a teething baby, etc.I spent hours upon hours researching baby carriers.I did not like what people were saying about the standard baby bjorn carrier and how it cased back pain.I knew there would be a lot of walks and time spent in the carrier so I was ready to drop some cash.The prints were super cute and I was so excited to receive my carrier.I checked the mail every day in anticipation and when I finally received it I was over the moon.My baby loves being in the carrier and it is so functional and easy to use.Also I thought the head thing was a weird concept, that is until I was walking through the neighborhood and he wanted to take a nap.Then the purpose became clear and I keep it handy.This is a very nice carrier.The "internal harness" is an added bonus, and it is supposed to make back carries easier.The product also comes with a DVD so you can learn how to use it properly.However, it just didn't fit me well at all.By the time I got all of the straps adjusted, I was left with 16-18 inches of excess strap that hung down and annoyed me.It also seemed too large in the shoulder area for me.I'm an average sized woman (5'5" and a size 10), so I can only imagine that this problem would be compounded for a skinnier person that myself.I ended up getting an Ergo carrier.It's not nearly as pretty as this Beco, and it lacks an internal harness...but it fits my body much better.The sun protection of this product is unmatched but it needs to not be an awkward size/shape.It doesn't fit well on my graco stroller.Attaches perfectly to the stroller for covering our 4-month old's legs at Disneyland.I also used the velcro ties on my clothing while nursing, to use as a cover up.My child doesn't like being in this at all.It doesn't seem to be the safest either.The feet don't stay in place which make the whole thing wobbly, the toy that hangs and swings by baby's head is hard plastic.I would not purchase this again and would never recommend this to a friend.My 4-month old enjoys this saucer.We use blankets in the seat and foam under his feet for support.At first, he could not reach or manipulate the toys that came with the saucer.I would see where he was looking, and I would show him how to use the toy.There are plenty of loops to add extra toys, and we used "lots of links" to get a variety of toys within his reach.Over the past two weeks, he has figured out how to reach for and play with almost all of the toys that came with the saucer.I also read some advice from a pediatrician to a parent who's child hated tummy time.They said get a saucer, and the child will strengthen their upper body making tummy time easier.This saucer is a lot of fun for a good price.My son likes the toys that come with it.However, if you don't - you have about $150 difference in the price from the other saucers to buy ones you do like.Just link them on!The only strange thing about it is that they have a teething toy at the top of the overhead bar.The baby would have to do a pull-up to use the teether?Not exactly what I expected.My baby is 7 months old and we purchased this when she was 4 months old and she is still not interested in playing with anything more than 5 minutes total.Also from 4.5 months until 7-8 months babies are obsessed with putting things into their mouths and this excersauser only frustrates them because nothing can be put into her mouth.We recently purchased a jumperoo for the same cost and that provides endless fun for her and it has very interactive toys and things she can put into her mouth.and when it's milk or juice, very sticky and messy.we only use straw cups, and this is definitely better than the snap-on lids that fall off when thrown in a tantrum.maybe if i empty and wash the cups each night and never put the liquids in the fridge at night... but who wants to throw away leftover yogurt smoothie every night?it's too expensive!My toddler kept putting his head in the toilet as soon as he realized he could.It doesn't look too bad, of course it's not the best to have some odd thing on your toilet, but it's better looking than all the ones I saw at the store.We decided not to go cheap on toilet baby proofing for our baby's sake but also for our own.I avoided putting a toilet lock on for a while because I thought it would be a pain to open every time you had to use the facilities.I chose this particular lock just because it looked easier to open than other models which were half the price.I guess that we were one of the lucky ones because it fits on our toilet lid fine.(We have a dual flush Caroma toilet with the original cheapie plastic lid.)(By the way, it says on the lock itself that it is not to be used on padded toilet lids.We have had it on a couple of days and I have made several middle of the night visits and have not had a single problem.(The real test will be when we have guests over - the same ones that couldn't figure out why there are two buttons on our toilet.)It is not too bad looking although it might look a little nicer in white so that it would blend in better.I am happy I spent the extra money on this model - it even has an indicator to let you know that the lock is in place and you won't have to worry about discovering your dearest child splashing around in the toilet!The latch is easy to use and it is better than no toilet lock at all but I believe there are better ones out there (check out my other reviews).I bought these thinking they would be a good transition from the cup with handles, but these are terrible!My son can barely get any liquid from the cup and the cap leaks from the sides where it should be water-tight.'Spill proof' is an inadequate claim!!!I have been weary about the munchkin brand before, but this officially ends my purchasing of this brand!Ridiculous!There are no suction devices to interfere, so your older child won't be frustrated by a slow flow.This also means that your mischievous toddler can turn these upside down for entertainment, but not much will leak out.Good investments overall.these work very well and kid uses them daily.only drawback is that the ring holds a lot of water.after washing it and letting it airdry, there is always a teaspoon of water on the lip that drops off.Okay Okay, so they are not 100 percent spill proof/although I will say I did not have the same leaking issues some of the other reviewers have had.I purchased the yellow to go with my baby's yellow room, but it's not yellow at all.It looks like the color of cornmeal, a real ugly boring color!Plus I love how it comes with the insert that can be easily washed.This is a great buy!I like it a lot.Baby seems to like it too.I with the while liner was bigger!Or maybe cover one half of the pad.That's why I gave it 4 stars.They seemed nice during the first use, but they wrinkle up terribly during washing and drying and are hard to reshape.As a result, they're very obvious through clothing.I avoid using them because of this.They have not leaked at all for me even through the night when leaking is abundant.They also have a shape to them which contour your breast shape, all others are just a flat circle.They do need to be washed every 1-2 days though since they tend to loose their shape but you have to wash them frequently anyway so doesn't bother me at all.These cotton nursing pads absorb quite a lot, and still feel thin and comfortable.They stay in the right place, and do not show trough the clothes.I do not recommend relying solely on this product at night though.So far, I've bought 4 products from Bebe au Lait - 2 packages of these burp cloths, one of theSimple by Bebe Au Lait Organic Burp Cloth Set 3-Pack, and theBebe au Lait Hooded Towel.Every single product had the seams tearing after one wash.Amazon's been great about refund/replacement, but still, what a hassle!If it happened once, or even twice, I might consider that a fluke.But all four products tore along the seams after the first wash. (One of the towels was torn out of the box.)* Edited to add: I recently bought another set of burp cloths from Bebe au Lait.There was a discount on a cute print, and I was wondering if maybe I just got a bad batch before.And guess what?This never happens to anything else I own, so I don't think there's a problem with my washer.So that's 5 terry cloth products I received so far from Bebe au Lait, and all 5 have ripped in the wash.My second son spent some time in the NICU.He was given this because it made it easier to keep the pacifer in his mouth.We took it home, and it works well.At 9 months old, I feel my little guy might be a tad on the older side for using this product.It's recommended up to six months, but I'm sure it's fine for the older babies who still like this particular pacifier.My son isn't a routine user of the Soothie, just occasionally he likes to suck on it while he goes to sleep.With teething, though, he'd become very distracted by the Soothie in his mouth (wanting to bite it and move it around) so I ordered this a few weeks back to see it it'd help undistract him.It did.He likes resting his hand on the dog (and occasionally chewing the dog's paws) as he falls asleep and is no longer roused by the need to aggressively teethe.Just big enough for baby.This product is very thick and very soft, making those bumps a lot easier.I've even caught my toddler chewing on it, without any pieces coming off into her mouth full of teeth.The only con is that the adhesive tape has started to loose it's sticky in a few spots, and I have to keep repositioning a corner piece constantly.Only bad thing is it didnt come with enough of the sticky tape...hmmmm.I absolutely love these bumpers!I was really dreading having to put bumpers on my super modern coffee table that I love for fear that it would completely ruin the look.I have gotten compliments from guests about it...although it takes them a while to notice them.I did have to buy this kit, an extra roll, and another 8-pack of corners (coffee table has 3 tiers of wood which makes for 12 corners!I am buying another kit in brown for my mom's place and having her throw away the ugly stretchable bumper she currently has.I was hesitant to buy this booster seat for my 18 month old son because of some of the negative reviews.And I'm not one to read instructions, so probably like most everyone else, I stuck the seat on a chair and started clipping the belts around the chair thinking "how complicated can this be?"Well, for some reason the belts come looped through the chair the WRONG way.You have to take them off and thread them in the RIGHT way.If you look at the pictures in the instructions it clearly shows the belt coming up from underneath and over the sides of the chair.I believe a reviewer commented on poor design to have the child sit on top of a strap.If they are sitting on the strap, then you did not install it correctly and the bottom strap will definitely be way loose, as this isn't how it is intended to go.Once I took a minute to look at the pictures I realized how it is supposed to go and was able to get it attached very securely.It is so soft and cushy too.My son was thrilled to sit in his big boy chair for the first time!We use the plates all the time!It's great to separate foods like chicken, rice, and the vegetable to help your little one get the foods out easier without them becoming a complete mess like on one plate.I like this thing.This is the worst bottle brush ever.It seems that they did not even test this product before producing it and putting it out on the shelf.If you are using Medela bottles or any bottle with a small opening like the Medela bottles, this bottle brush will barely fit through the opening.I have to push the brush through the opening with some effort and wvw nwith that, the brush still did not clean the bottle well.As other viewers wrote, the soap dispenser is a waste of money.The soap leaks out from the top when you fill it and it leaked from the bottom when I screwed the bottom back on.I wish I read these reviews before using this brush because I would have returned it to the store.It doesn't scratch our bottles and we haven't had an issue with it not lathering the detergent at all.It doesn't matter which end you store it on, which is super disappointing.If you store it with the brush end up (where the dispenser is) it actually leaks out of the threaded part of the handle where it twists onto the soap storage.If you store it brush side down, it leaks out of the giant hole which is supposed to dispense the soap.Sassy definitely needs to either re-design the soap dispenser or get rid of it altogether!I will say that we've purchased several bottle brushes and I keep re-purchasing this one, because it's just a great bottle brush.We just don't use the soap dispenser at all.We use this all the time.I guess I didn't read the description to well because what I got was not what I was expecting.This is velour as in those track suits that everyone is wearing.Not that this is a bad thing, the sheet is quite thick and cushy.Someone said they had a problem with a strange smell on their sheet, no problems here with that.I have washed this quite a few times and it seems to be holding up very well.The velour seems to add a little extra warmth for the baby on cold nights as compared to a standard cotton sheet.so soft and comfy for my newborn.It fits fairly well but is amazingly soft and has washed well so far.Wow, this is a short review, but there isn't too much more to say.It's a sheet.It's soft.It fits as well as any other crib sheet.The sheet was very loose once on the mattress & it made me nervous because the baby could pull at it & potentially pull it off the mattress.It is well designed to fig snugly and not bunch up.The material is soft and holds up well to washing and tumble drying.It is a little thinner than I had expected, but overall a great buy.I love the fact that it allows my baby to sleep on something soft and organic!Great sheet, very soft, organic for the price of non-organic sheets and after several washes it looks and feels new.This sheet saver didn't even fit my crib so was totally useless to me.It isn't wide enough to tie unto the crib and I have a standard crib so not sure what the problem is.Needless to say I don't use it.I've been using this Sheet Saver for about 2 weeks now.It's stayed tied in place so far.My son hasn't wet it yet so I can't vouch for the water proof-ness yet.I like that and I like that if there is an accident, I don't have to even take him out of the crib.I just untie this, slip it out from under him and let him go back to sleep... or, tie another one under him or at the other end of the crib and move him down.Sometimes she just likes to hug it like a stuffed animal, which is fine.My only complaint is that the pillowcase is a bit big and slides off the pillow constantly.I spend a lot of time hearing "uh oh...oh no" and then seeing my toddler pad over to me with the pillow in one hand and the case in the other, wanting me to fix it.My friends who have cloth highchair cushions are always complaining about keeping the seat clean.Well worth the extra money to get the keekaroo and cushion set!This product was easy to find, easy to install and works securely.Easy to hang even with a thumbtack!So cute!My son really likes the Avent Pacifiers that is shaped like a sideways figure 8.I think the sideways figure 8 Avent Pacifiers are better.Just stick with the regulars -- this night time one loses any "glow" so quickly that it's no different than a regular one.My baby definitely prefers the Avent pacifiers.We like these because they are so much easier to find at night in a dark room.We've tried other types of pacifiers but both my children liked these pacifiers best.Our child isn't big on any pacifier but he's taken to these ones the best.They don't have a top or bottom so we don't have to make sure it's in correctly which is nice at night.They also come with plastic covers that clip right on so when it's in the diaper bag or in a pocket the part of the pacifier our son sucks on doesn't get dirty.Wow!~ for the price, it's unbelievable.I think by now I looked at every crib comforter set out there (online and in store) and nothing would match this great value.* It's a sewed on pattern, not printed one* You get not only very EXPENSIVE LOOKING comf set, but also 2 window valances (normally around $22 /ea), 3 pc wall art, toy bag and diaper stacker.Didn't use it yet or wash it, but it looks like it will be ok.Just spent around $300 on similar set of stuff on a huge sale.I am having a girl, so first is pink butterfly set and this one will be for a change.I liked it so much, I just added a mobile and lamp shade to my baby registry!Can't be happier.Would have given 10 stars if I could.Great buy for the price, higly recommend it!I didn't even think of making my own, but most fabric stores sell nylon mesh and home improvement stores sell great suction cups.As with most things sold with suction cups, the suction cups don't suction.This bag would hold a good amount of toys however the weight from those toys will never be held with the included suction cups.I will be going to a local home store to get stronger suction cups.This pump died on me only after one month of use.One month!The suction went out first and then it just stopped working.I guess you get what you pay for.And while it was working it was a pain to clean and the although not super loud, the noise it makes while pumping is really annoying.If you want a pump that is reliable, super easy to clean and use get the Ameda Purely Yours, but whatever you do stay away from this one.I got blisters from using this pump on a high setting.I am surprised that other reviewers have been able to use this pump turned up without pain.I have to use mine on the lowest possible setting that will pump any milk.My son doesn't have to fight a vaccume to get his milk.They do leak of you do not get the cap on right or if you heat it with the nipple cap tight.They are hard to knock over, unlike even Dr. Brown's regular narrow bottles.We wanted to try Dr. Brown's bottle cause our LO is gassy and spits up more often than we like.In addition, the wide neck provides a good large opening for easy mixing of formula.However, we have a big problem with this model.In my opinion, its a big mistake.For whatever reason, they decided they need to compete in price or increase profit....  what a shame.They all have vented bottles that reduces colics.I will try out the standard version but not sure if our baby will get used to the smaller nipple and latch on.If that doesn't work, guess which brand I'm going to switch now...  what a shame.EDIT:  Yes, the product works great, our LO spits up/vomits less and the level 1 nipples flows slower than Avent's lvl 1, which is a good thing for our LO, she tends to choke on Avent's.She burps much less now which is a good thing but its harder on us since we expect her to burp so the burping session is longer than usual now.Maybe later we will feel comfortable not trying to burp her for that long.We also tried the standard version, unfortunately, our LO won't take to its smaller nipple and mixing formula is not easy with its narrower neck.Overall, Dr. Brown's wide neck is the best bottle for reducing colic and gases.We just can't trust where its made.We even wrote to the company to express our disappointment in which they responded assuring us that all products coming from overseas are vigorously tested by 3rd party.He loves the wide-neck bottles and has had to confusion what so ever.I would highly reccommend that wide-neck for those moms who are also breastfeeding (more like a real nipple).They say it reduces gas and spit-ups.I am not sure about spit-ups but it sure do reduce gas as it helps not create bubbles.The only thing is: It doesn't fit in my Medela pump, so I have to pump in another bottle and then transfer it to these.If you really like these bottles and pump, use the regular neck Dr Brown bottles.Sometimes it leaked too but I'm not sure why.I also bought Born Free bottles and preferred those as they were easier to clean (less parts) and seemed to offer the same venting advantages.My baby is 7 weeks and since he was born i've been using born free bottles- had no problem.But due to his terrible gas, i decided to try dr Brown's.I initially got the longer bottles- they were great.Lets just say i had to leave early because out of the four bottles, my baby got the contents of the two.The other two almost completely leaked out.I was using Avent bottles because I bought the Avent breast pump.I was having a horrible time with a gassy baby.I refused to believe it was because of the bottles because I loved how simple the avent bottles are to put together and wash.After complaining to her pediatrician about her gas, she suggested Dr. Brown's bottles.I decided to see what the hype was about.(My friends also swear by them.)It was an instant difference.She doesn't scream with gas pains after feeding.There is a nipple, rim, bottle, round object, and a tube.It's not really that big of a deal to me.I like the wide neck bottle because it fits into my diaper bag better since it's shorter.It also seems like the baby's "latch" looks more like a breastfeeding latch than the other skinny bottles.(I might be crazy - that's just my impression.)If there's a negative it would be that they leak occasionally.I am not taking a star away because I believe that's just a side effect of the way the anti-colic bottles have to be designed to release air out somewhere besides the end of the nipple.They leak just as often as the polypropelene Avent.It's always easy to fix by unscrewing it and screwing it back together.In the movies, Doc Brown solved the problems with his scientific genius.Well, this Dr. Brown's bottle didn't appear to amaze with any science or genius.Baby's gas and intestinal upset from breast milk has not changed with Dr. Brown's bottles.I can say they don't leak.One disadvantage to wide neck is you can't find extras like nipples in the regular stores you have to buy them online.I do wish that they had adapters to use them for pumping.But they help tremendously with gas.Ever since I started using the Dr. Brown's bottles, my son has had minimal gas.He'll burp 2/3 times after feedings.Some people say they leak, but you just have to be sure that the inner tube is pushed in tight with the round beige insert that lets the milk flow to the nipple, and that it is snug in the mouth of the bottle.Then once the milk is the temperature I want, I'll tighten it.Also, because the bottles are thick, it may take a little longer for the milk to warm.But really not a big deal since I just make my milk room temperature.Very durable, and I just use the dishwasher trays to clean all the parts.It pushes easy, turns on a dime with one hand and the basket is huge.I can't emphasize how much I enjoy this!There is one draw back.The car seat does not snap into the frame.I have a Chicco Key Fit 30.For this sole reason, my husband does not like the lack of security.I have the Chicco Key Fit 30 and since it doesnt clip onto shopping carts it was making my shopping a little difficult with my newborn and toddler.You can't go wrong with this purchase, while a little more than the others, just sell it on craigslist or something if you plan on not having any more kids!!I have just received the easy traveler and am super excited!It steers well.Although Maclaren doesn't list the Chicco Key Fit as a compatible infant car seat, it is compatible and fits well.It really can be opened and closed one handed.It has a large basket on the bottom.The cupholder is ridiculous so I have never attached it, but i do wish it had a functional one for some of those long walks.The material (inside and out) is top quality and super durable.You can just clip them to the handle of any stroller and you have easy access to your bag.I did return this thing after all.Just too gawdy for my tastes, and really not big enough.I just took this bag out of the box.My initial reaction is that it's a bit small, and a bit too gawdy for my taste (I got the pewter one, which is shiny and kind of glittery).I'm a minimalist and have "classic taste" so this is a bit over the top for me.I'm 37 weeks pregnant and tired of sifting through a million different products.I was considering just getting a big Baggalini (I love that brand) at my local store, and probably will get one for my boyfriend, since I'm certain he will not want to carry this one around.Anyway, I'm giong to stuff it full of things and make the best of it, although I do feel it's overpriced for what it is.If this was purchased locally and I could jsut go return it at the store, I would.I just LOVE this bag!!SO much versatility!I have a 4wk old & a 2.5yr old and I can carry everything for them both, plus everything I would normally carry in a purse inside this bag.Totally worth the price.I just received this bag and so far love it.I love that it's pretty enough to pass as a purse too so I only need one bag.of this bag.My problem is that it is already looking worn and the fabric has frayed in a few places(along seams).It should not be doing these things so soon.I purchased this diaper tote through the Target option here on Amazon, who advertised that they were selling the Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag Tote Bag, Pewter Dot for $29.99 (currently still being advertised).I purchased this item on September 3rd, and when I received the item, I was sent a completely different diaper bag, which after some research I discovered was calledSpark by Skip Hop Stroller Tote Mod Circles - Bluein Berry, not actually Blue, which looks completely different from the Studio Diaper Tote Bag.I returned the incorrect bag thinking it was a minor mistake only to wait almost a month later to receive my replacement and to get the wrong bag again!What is up with Target advertising that they have the Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag Tote Bag, Pewter Dot for sale for $29.99??They're clearly mixing it up with another bag that they're selling and misleading the buyer!SO unhappy!****Update 5/4/2011I finally received the correct bag after purchasing it directly from Amazon and have used it for several months now, so I just wanted to edit my review.Originally the review was for the purchase made through Target only, and I gave 1 star for the constant bad service from Target/Amazon, however that was not a fair review of the product itself.I have now upped the rating to 3 stars.The bag has lots of helpful pockets, however I find that it is too narrow to fit a lot of things inside.Totally disproportional to my height and body shape.It's not that big of a deal, but it makes me look a little like a munchkin, so if you do care about how your bag looks against your body, this is definitely a bag for a taller mom.Shorter moms should reconsider getting a slightly smaller bag.First of all, I love this diaper bag.I have only had it for a few days, but I switched from my old diaper bag (JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag) and am already happy I did.This bag has so many pockets and places to put things and it is very intuitive -- exactly where I wish something would go (my wipes for example) there is a place for it.I actually have empty pockets now!It is not only functional, but it is really stylish.The Pewter pattern looks even BETTER in person than the picture, it actually makes me look more put together.I almost bought the black one and I'm glad I didn't, this one will go with everything.I didn't plan on getting a diaper bag that looks like a stylish purse, I was really just looking for something functional, but now I am glad I did.Ive owned A LOT of diaper bags - even bags that were more expensive 'designer' brands.I needed this bag because I have a baby coming soon and a potty training toddler.The pewter dot is very fashionable.I hope this bag holds up well because I cant imagine finding another that I love this much!He loves to throw it and smack it against things and so far, it's been great.It keeps my wipes very moist and is a very convenient and helpful design.This wipes case with the convenient slider does just that and more.I didn't really want a kiddie kind of wipes case and wanted one that held more than a few wipes.It attaches easily to my stroller and fits great in my diaper bag.It's very cute and I get a lot of compliments and inquiries about it when I'm out and about.A great buy and a great price for all it does!I was so disappointed with this product, the red closure does NOT provide an airtight seal, so within a couple days all the wipes were dried out and useless.The reviews I had read before purchasing seemed to praise it, and I was looking for a way to take just a few wipes with me vs a whole pack -- but this was a big waste of money.DONT buy it!I love this case.I've been asked by moms watching me use it where did I get it.I like that I can hang it off the stroller or anywhere else as needed which is useful for me.The case makes it easier to get to wipes and I can resupply as needed.it's made of much harder plastic than the cheap travel wipes cases that come free in the box when you buy diapers in bulk.3.The case snaps shut but tends to open on its own too easily.Example: I was walking and only holding the case by the black strap so it was swinging with my arm motion.The case popped WIDE open and all my wipes fell into the dirt (we were camping)!nevertheless, now I am "scared" to hook it onto the outside of things bc i am scared the wipes will all fall out.2.I'll make this review to-the-point.Reasons to NOT waste your money on this:1.It literally takes up 30% of my diaper bag.2.This case looks good, but is bigger than all of the other cases I have and too bulky for my diaper bag.They are definitely not for a newborn or even one up to possible 4 months.They're a little thin, but soft and a good size, so I can have half of her wrapped up nicely while drying/dressing the other half.Would definitely recommend these!Update: Three years later and we still use these daily!They aren't enough to get a three-year-old girl (and all this HAIR) dry, but they're softer than my regular bath towels so I use these first.The colors still look vibrant, though the patches may have gotten overdried in the dryer at one point because at least one of them doesn't lie flat anymore.We have the Bumbleride stroller and unfortunately it does not have a console.I can fit 2 drinks, cell phone, keys, etc - lots of room.And w/ the 4 straps it fits well on the stroller handle and I don't have to worry about my drinks spilling!Haven't found anyhing wrong with this purchase yet.Received it a week ago and it proves it can retain heat and block wind.For me there is nothing worse about winter than cold wind  here in the north east so I was more than willing to shell out $30 for a quality made product that fits our chicco carseat.saves me the hassle of layering clothing and blankets which always threaten to blow away.I would recommend this product.Sure it doesn't make very big batches (maybe four to six 4 ounce-containers at one time), but realistically: if you have a younger infant, you feed 1-2 ounces portions, and so that's quite a few meals (8-10).Each run is 20-30 min at the most (including the grinding), and you can do other things while the food steams.With an older infant, like mine, this is the age when you want to challenge their palate a little and introduce some variety in their diet, so it is fine for that.The verdict: 2-3 hours every Sunday (if you do it once a week) for a 9-month old who will eat out of your plate in 3 months, and I am sure half that for a younger baby who is just getting weaned.And in case you wonder, I work full time.I love this little machine.I worked as a professional nanny for years before having my own baby and I made a lot of baby food during that time (lucky kids :)  This machine makes home made baby food a cinch!Here is what I love:Smaller batches - unless you are living your own version of "baby boom" you just don't need to make gallons of apple sauceFast!you will love it, promise.I won the Beaba from a blog giveaway, but I don't think I would ever spend the money to buy one.I only used mine about a dozen times before passing it on to a friend.It did everything it was advertised to do.I don't think it saves on time and effort, though.You still have to clean, peel, and cut your fruits or veggies into chunks, so no time saved there.However, by the time you steam and puree your food, you end up with only about half a cup of baby food, maybe a bit more.Let's say you're going to make some sweet potatoes.The Beaba can only cook about half of an average sweet potato at a time.With the Beaba, start to finish, from peeling to chopping to steaming to blending to cooling, you're looking at around 30 to 45 minutes before you can feed your baby.Also, food coming out of the Beaba is EXTREMELY hot, rightly so, but you can't feed a baby food that hot so you have to let it cool, which just adds to your food prep time.Anyone who is serious about making most or all of their own baby food is going to want to make baby food in BULK.Most busy moms don't have time to waste on a product like the Beaba that makes such a small amount of food at a time.I have a KitchenAid 7-cup food processor which I found on sale at BB&B; for around sixty bucks.I would steam my veggies and fruits on the stove or even in the microwave, then puree them quickly in the food processor, usually making about 4 cups of baby food at a time.Also, one pot, one steamer basket, and one food processor was MUCH easier to clean than the Beaba.The Beaba streamer basket was stained orange the first time I used it and I didn't care for all the little parts and pieces I needed to clean on the Beaba.Don't waste your money on fancy or expensive baby food storage containers.Each night before I went to bed, I would pull a couple of containers out of the freezer and stick them in the fridge for the next day.I bought this thinking it would be easier to have a two-in-one machine to make my baby's food.The problem is that you can only make about four servings of food at a time.I'm a working mom, so I need to make two weeks worth of food at a time and freeze it.That means at least six batches in the Beaba, which would take hours.In addition, the plastic is pretty thin, so I'm afraid to put the parts in the dishwasher.This means HAND washing!Add the descaling requirements, and this thing takes more time to clean than to cook with.The steamer also doesn't have any kind of 'off' signal, so if you have 'mommy brain' and walk away from it while it is steaming, it won't remind you when it is finished so you might come back long after the food has gone cold and then you have to throw it out.The food processor blade is really inefficient so it takes a long time to get a consistent texture.If you are processing anything starchy, that means it gets pretty glutinous by the time all the big chunks are out of the batch.For the price, you can get a full size steamer (that chimes when finished), and basic food processor or hand blender that will blend the food faster and more evenly.And you can use those products for the whole family, not just the limited time the baby needs pureed food.The Black & Decker steamer is very affordable and doesn't present the water scale problems that this machine has.Well the plastic cracked in the cooker.So now I have this thing that wont steam and  would leak everywhere and it was a mess!I contacted their customer service- who got back to me quickly and said they would send out a replacement bowl.It's a month and half later- NO REPLACEMENT PART!Also the plastic part around the blade grows mold and there is NO easy way or a way I've found to get it completely out!!!I have to say..as much as I did love this I would NEVER spend that kind of money on a baby cooker again.I received this as a gift from my mother-in-law and it is one of the best inventions ever.I wish all moms can own this babyfood maker becuase it is the easiest thing in the world.If more moms can see how easy it is to make fresh homemade babyfood, then less moms would resort to purchasing expensive jarred babyfood.Although Beaba products are expensive in general, the quality speaks for itself.Also, the babyfood maker will no doubt pay for itself with the $$ money saved from purchasing expensive jarred babyfood.I did the most basic way with my first child using steamer and blender.This is way more convenience and faster!I just need to give 5 minutes work to prep and clean.So I now "cook" twice a day for breakfast and dinner with ease =)I can see the difference in taste too.Yes you can use the liquid that was coming out in the steamer too.However, it is hard to measure how much water I should put to steam the whole batch of food.More often, I put a lot of water because I worried for burning the pan.So the liquid ended up not as concentrated as the one in the Beaba Babycook.*Thanks for reading my review, hopefully you can find it useful.I apologize for any grammatical errors - ESL =p *It literrally takes minutes to make (not counting the time it needs to steam the veggies of course).I cut up the veggies, put it in the steamer basket to steam cook, by the time I get out of the shower and change, the food is ready and I just puree it for 20 seconds and my daughter has fresh yummy veggies for the day!It  is super  healthy  for her and she LOVES it!I received this as a gift from another mom.It is perfectly designed, solves many things in one product and space.I realize that you could pull out your pot and steam the veggies, then dump them in your large food processor or blender, but this is the way to go.Cleaning it is much easier than if I were to wash a pot steamer and food processor.I never plan on purchasing baby food and because of that I could not imagine making her food any other way.I highly recommend this product for anyone who is interested in making their children's food from scratch.The ease of use and joy I get out of feeding her fresh food far outweigh the cost (which isn't too steep to begin with).Also in response to the negative comments I have read:  I use purified water from a zero water pitcher in the well and over 2 months of constant use there isn't any type of build-up from hard water minerals or anything.I recommend using filtered or bottled water plus it's probably better for your child anyway.I don't freeze any food, but if I did it makes more than enough to.It's also so handy that it's easy for me to make a vegetable, clean it quickly, and follow it up with a fruit, etc.I know I sound like I probably work for Beaba, but I truly love mine and I really think opting for pots & pans followed by a food mill or hand mixer is a huge mistake.Anyone purchasing this cooker might want to look at Sure Lid Containers.The 2 1/2 cup cooker makes plenty for packing/freeze portions.My 22 month old is totally into tea sets now so I thought this would be a great alternative to those gross squirt toys (threw all those away when I found out about all that scary bacteria that can live inside them).All in all, my daughter is really enjoying this in the bath.This is just such a cute idea for little ones who love to have tea parties.Even for my one year-old, this was a great toy.The only caution I will give is that my daughter will use the cups to drink bath water from -- but we stop her and redirect her and it's no problem.The sugar bowl has holes so the water goes through like a strainer -- so no risk of drinking bath water there.I actually use the teapot to rinse her hair after shampooing!This wasn't an effective product for either of our sons (one who doesn't like pacifiers and one who would have one in his mouth always, if allowed to).My wife and I also found the shape of the Teethifier to vaguely resemble... well...I'll just say it... testicles.I feel bad now, but it's true.To make up for it, I'll add the one thing that I find missing from most negative reviews: a recommendation.Plus, his next set of molars are due to come in so I thought he could use it.He did like it, but it got tossed aside within a couple weeks.All the teethers on the market seem to be so big.I felt like I would never find one that worked.Then, the teethifier turned up again.She stopped taking a pacifier around 2 months, but will chew on this for quite a while at a time.She chews on all three portions of the teethifier.It is designed in such a way that she cannot choke on it (unlike some teethers that have long parts or long pieces of fabric), and there are small enough portions of it that she can get it in her mouth and even past her front teeth which is impossible with most teethers.It was definitely money well spent!My son has all sorts of teethers: rings, hard, soft, water-filled, rubbery, beaded, cloth, you name it.It has made him stop crying, too.Just the right density, not too hard (pretty hard though), and definitely not too soft.They can adjust it to get the right spot.My 15 month old had all but two of his baby teeth (14 of them) in by the time he turned one!A happy-go-lucky baby turns crazy at 8 months and stays that way for 4 straight months as the teeth pop through one after another :(  So all that are left now at 15 months are the 2 year old molars.This teethifier is a neat idea, but it looks so much like a pacifier, well a double pacifier, haha, that he tried to suck on it, but just thought it was a cruel joke.We're are in a short reprieve right now but when they start really coming in, I'm hoping he'll understand more language, and I can put some Orajel on one of the nubs and stick it back there to give him the idea.I'm not giving up on it.'Cuz sticking my finger back there has not worked out well for me.Our 10 month does not like it at all.She prefers Razbaby RaZberry Teether(from 3 mo till now it's her fav.)Maybe later she will use this weird teether.I like the description of the product and unusual shape that's why I give it 2 stars.My daughter, now 5-months, is VERY squirmy.I never leave her alone on the table, but she tries to crawl and wiggle and twist her way right off of it and has for a couple months.My only bad point is because is a little small, I'd rather have a 3 inches longer.I just pulled it out of the package to inflate it and there is NO WAY that it eco-friendly phthalate free!I was engulfed in the smell of plastic (which means strong presence of chemicals!!)Already not happy, and I am usually easy to please as long as it follows the description!It says eco-friendly, I don't want to smell it before it even leaves the box!Now my child has to sit in toxic chemical plastic smell while taking a bath in her eco-friendly shampoo/body wash for her sensitive skin and earth conscious family!I am surprised that no one mentioned that you need to have a pump to inflate it, and even then it takes a long time to inflate the tub due to the design of the openings for the inflation.So when I read their instructions on use (deflate, wash and hang to dry after each use) I just laughed out loud.We're planning on keeping it inflated and bathing our son in it until the tub begins to leak and then just throw it away.He never did that in his other tub made of plastic.If you plan to travel a lot, or move arround, this is the tub for your baby!It was a very good investment!One day our little one started getting bruises all over the house and I went nuts buying safety bumpers.Can't tell you how many times this bumper guard has saved the head/face from a nasty bruise.Was on craigslist and no one sells this stuff 2nd hand, probably b/c they give it to good friends/family instead!BUY IT.It is a little smaller than I thought it would be and I had a hard time getting the little plastic thingies out of the pillow.I really love this monitor.Has he got an arm or leg caught or is he just crying because he doesn't want to go to sleep?Now I enjoy watching him go to sleep with this great monitor.My husband and I watch and laugh as he plays with his stuffed rabbit and watches his hang on aquarium toy until he falls asleep.It's really so comforting to me and I wish I had bought it several months ago when we made the transition to putting him to sleep in his own room.A great product.The picture is super clear during the day and still quite clear at night.The only issue I have with it is that it doesn't have a subtle "dial" volume control but more of a push button type and the lowest volume is still really loud.It works well day or night.Our neighbors have a different Summer monitor and we haven't had any issues with seeing each other's homes or anything.Our four year old loves to go up and talk with our one year old when he awakens from his nap, and I can listen in/watch while finishing up making lunch!Video monitors are a great idea!I am SO GLAD we have the video instead of just sound.We co-sleep, so when he naps it is in our bed as well - he tends to roll and twist in his sleep but if I use a wedge he just gets angry he can't move and wakes up!Unfortunately, he hasn't ever been a swaddle baby.This has saved us lots of stress and lets our little guy sleep in peace.We have used it for about 8 months now.I use it constantly.The baby has snagged the camera a few times to put it through his own tests and the monitor has been knocked off the arm of the couch or table by one of our cats many, many, times...it keeps on working great.Extremely durable and very clear picture.I will be getting my friends these for their baby showers!We bought this to monitor our first baby.Here are our thoughts.The handheld unit has an annoying "feature" whereby it saves battey power by turning the screen off seemingly every five minutes.Unfortunately, it is a stretched 4:3 picture made to look widescreen.Our baby's head looks enlongated when he is sleeping in his crib.Another issue is the amount of interference to which the 900MHz band is susceptible.The infrared is nice, as we can see our baby in the dark.Finally, I was excited to learn that you could order an additional cable that allows you to plug in the handheld unit into your TV.Unfortunately, the company makes this cable difficult to obtain.Instead of offering it online, they require you to call them on the phone and give someone you don't know your credit card information.Purchasing on the web is safer than using your credit card in a restaurant or over the phone!I emailed them to find out where I could purchase this cable and they sent back an email telling me to call them on the phone.I LOVE this monitor!It's so nice to be able to sit downstairs while my baby is sleeping upstairs and be able to check on him without having to worry about waking him up.We had some static issues at first that were somehow magically resolved when we got rid of our wireless Internet router and bought an apple airport router.I'm not sure if this is coincidence or what, but if you're having static issues my experience might help!Overall this is a great monitor, so worth the price.I'm a first time mom and a little paranoid about, well, everything ;) I just love being able to check on my baby whenever I want!Great product simple to use, and works as advertised, some static when walking around monitor between cameras in other rooms and it.But works and is a good deal here at Amazon.I would buy again.I know that many people would subtract a star for the fact that it does not automatically close.After extensive research we could not find a gate this size that did so it doesn't feel right to knock a star off for something that other similar products don't do.It is actually nice to be able to leave the gate open during bedtime and nap time.Our Son is a 1 year old tank - 32lbs+ and 33+ inches and the gate hardly moves when he pulls himself up on it or attacks it.Installation was relatively simple (we went into wood door jams over a 6ft span).I know some people complained about this but it isn't really an issue (aesthetically or safety-wise) and makes installation easier.Doesn't seem to affect the overall stability of the gate so no biggie.We were hoping/led to believe this gate is white.We are extremely satisfied with this gate.We have a large dog who loves to jump up on guests coming in the house.So we used this gate as a barrier to the entryway.I was afraid it would look tacky but it actually looks a little stylish.It holds up great to the 85-lb dog jumping on it as well.I don't know exactly what the issue is here, but we just got these and I immediately noticed that my baby got a red rash where ever these touched his skin.I'm not sure if it's the material or if it's a rubbing issue.All I can say is that I haven't had this problem with other teethers.We have a Sophie and haven't had this problem either... maybe it's a different material or the vanilla scent, but I'm not giving them back to him.I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for teethers for their babies.My little guy has had these since he was 4 months old, and 4 months later they are still a favorite!I can't say enough about this, with so many recalls and dangerous products it's nice to find a safe product, and they are not made in china.The rubber is firm but soft if that makes sense.Any time I offer one of these he immediately scoops it up, which is not always the case with other toys of his that are more take it or leave it.I paid $12 with shipping which seemed a little high, but after owning them I would have paid more if I had to.Once upon a timeVulli Sophie the Giraffe Teetherwas my baby's favorite toy.After teething for months but getting no teeth all I can figure is she got sick of Sophie.One for the house and one for the diaper bag.The baby prefers the lamb's butt and the elephant's ear/head.After a couple of weeks I noticed that the seams of the mold in those areas does wear a bit easier and tiny bits of the rubber were coming off so I do recommend being really careful with these softer rubber teether since they do have the potential for that.The vanilla scent is pleasant but not strong and my baby seems not to notice it.These are a little pricier than some teethers but make up for it in durability and versatility.Standard crib sheets seem to fit it OK (a little small).In my search I had a hard time deciding whether this mattress was truly organic and without chemicals.The cover is made of vinyle-laminate which is the only part of this mattress thats makes it not completely organic.Sealy does however state that the cover although vinyl-laminate is phthalate and flammability compliant and does not contain toxic fire retardants.Sealy makes the exact same mattress called the Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Dream which is made with a cotton cover.I was able to find this mattress at Bed Bath & Beyond and Buy Buy Baby websites fot about 160$ plus shipping.Sealy's website is also helpful at [...].*Soybean foam is CertiPUR-US certified and has been tested for indoor air emissions, durability

today and I'm very impressed.Also, no worries about the firmness of the mattress, it is very firm for baby.I'm very impressed and very glad I bought it!I am giving this mattress a five star rating, because, even though my three month old son won't sleep the night in his crib, he has at least stopped bawling whenever I put him down in it since I replaced his old mattress with the Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress.The squared off edges create a snug fit thus eliminating any gaps between mattress and crib frame.I bought these as soon as I noticed my son was mouthing the Ergo straps.I ordered the Mocha colored ones because I was concerned about stains showing.However, the vendor in charge of fulfilling the order sent me the cream ones.The last as long as they need to, then the baby grows out of them.I really couldn't be happier.I finally feel like the money I spent on cloth diapers won't go to waste.I still use them but not as much as I thought I would.in our failed attempt to cloth diaper and cloth wipe-her, we ended up not using these as intended, but they have still been great as little spit up cleaners and booger wipers.they've washed well and yes, the roll up a little on the ends, but that's not a problem nor does it affect the products absorbency or integrity.they could even be used as smaller washcloths...we just have a ton of baby washcloths so don't need more but point being, they could serve multiple purposes.I do agree that the tag is cumbersome, but not hard to clip off.The only reason I only gave four stars was because I was able to make wipes out of cheap flannel and those have been my favorite cloth wipes.But if you're not able to make your own, I would definately recommend these!They are amazingly soft, but yet easily clean up messy newborn stools.I know one reviewer commented on the tags getting in the way.I do sort of wish they weren't there, but they don't bother me too much - and they definitely wouldn't deter me from buying these.I also like these better than other cloths I have tried.I feel they are worth the money.It is so much easier to just use these and throw everything into the diaper pail at once - and they should make up their cost within a couple months.These are very soft and although they show through , I don't care because I just wear them at night.I have been lucky that I don't have much of a leaking problem except for over night.So if you are someone that produces a lot of milk and leak all the time you may want to find something more absorbent.I ordered these as my nipples were sore and I wanted a soft breast pad.After washing, these are not soft.I prefer my cotton breast pads.Also, the care for these involve many steps and not worth the effort.They also can stick to your nipple if your nipple is slightly damp and can leave fuzz.But they are not soft enough and are too flat in my bra.I didn't care so much what it looked like through my shirt.That worked wonders for me.They have not leaked at all, although my baby is 4 months old so I don't have that crazy newborn leaking milk situation anymore.Some reviewers complain that the cloth pads show through clothing and the disposable kind don't.But to me, the "green" benefit of reusable pads, as well as the economic benefit of using them over and over outweighs the inconvenience of having to adjust them occasionally so they don't show through my clothing.Besides, it's only some shirts/sweaters, and only if I have a very thin bra on.These are nice and absorbent, BUT the Snappi fasteners, shown in the photo, do not work once you have washed the diapers a few times.This is hard to do with a squirming baby that wants to put her hands near those sharp things!update: I ordered safety pins and they don't penetrate the material without pushing so hard that I may possibly stab my child.I really wanted to like these prefolds.They ended up being really expensive spit-up cloths.It becomes more vexing when baby starts squirming!Don't waste your money on these diapers :(They are a bit bulky but it has not been a major issue, all of his outfits still fit properly.I use these with a Snappi, which sometimes can be hard to secure to the diaper.I've found out that the snappis work best with 100% cotton diapers but the hemp in these diapers are super absorbent so it is worth it.We have a few types of prefolds: sherpa cotton, hemp-cotton (the BabyKicks), and plain old cotton Indian prefolds; these tend to get used up first, because they are the best.They are far more absorbant than cotton on its own, although they are a good deal bulkier.Since bulk equals more absorbant, I'll take it over a thin but flimsy diaper that is soaked through in seconds with a tiny bit of baby pee.We have them in the newborn size, which is pretty generously-sized.We have to fold the top down to get them on our 8-pound baby.This doesn't bother me, it just means we'll get a longer life out of them as the baby grows.They are easy to use and the snappis hook on with ease.So bottom line, yes they are costly as far as prefolds go, but they are worth it.WARNING: Do not use an enzyme spray on these prefolds, it will decrease the absorbancy.PROs: DurableCONs: Shrink in dryer, take too long to dry.I love to use these prefolds as a night time diaper, but only as a night time diaper.The hemp gets more stiff with every wash, as expected, and because it's a pretty long prefold, you have to fold it down in the front.Because of the stiffness and the bulk in the front, I don't like to have my baby in a sitting position in these.I can tell that it digs into her stomach.They are difficult to use with a snappi but it doesn't really need it.The diaper covers usually hold them in place pretty well.Prepping requires you to wash these atleast 6 times in hot water in order to remove the natural oils inherent in cotton, hemp, bamboo, etc.If you don't want to wash these 6 times, boiling them with a little bit of Dawn Original is a good short cut.Of course they still need to be washed atleast 3 times after that to wash out the Dawn.But this must be done before the initial use in order for it to be absorbent.Thereafter, they'll only get better with each wash.Update after 5 months of use:I am still using the green edged babykicks and my daughter is in the 50th percentile for height and weight.It seems like I'll be using these for atleast another month.These are workhorse prefolds, no doubt.I'll definitely be buying the next size up.For the first 6 months we used the high-end pocket diapers for my daughter, but by the time she outgrew those I was really looking to save some money and thus considered pre-folds.I was skeptical because my daughter is a very heavy wetter.These hemp pre-folds are far more absorbent than the average cotton ones, and we haven't had any leaks.For overnights I use Fuzzibunz microfiber liners with these (had them left over from the pocket diapers, any type of liner would work).Pros:1.Very absorbent, no leaks.2.Soft material for sensitive babies.3.Dry quickly after washing.4.Thicker material is a little hard to fasten Snappis to at first- once you get the hang of it, not a problem.2.I think they will still fit for awhile, there just won't be an slack to fold the legs to keep them in a cover.All in all, I recommend these diapers.My almost 6 month old is a heavy wetter, and we stick one of these in a Fuzzi Bunz at night, along with the microfiber insert and another thinner hemp insert.I needed the extra length to help keep the insert covering the areas I needed covered most :)  I use these small inserts as night time doublers in my gdiapers.All in all this is a grade A diaper insert.It cuts way down on the bulk -- when I used 2 microfiber inserts, some of his pajamas didn't even fit!And the extra bulk caused the leg casings to gap and leak occasionally.These hemp inserts do the trick -- they are narrower in the middle, thin overall, and very absorbant.I occasionally use them as daytime inserts when I want to dress my son in a trimmer outfit (jeans, etc.).One hemp insert in a Sunbaby or BumGenius pocket diaper seems to be about the same bulk as a disposable diaper.I ordered the size small.However, they are nice and thin and super absorbent.I ended up cutting/sewing mine to make them smaller.I use them as double-stuffers in my 8-mo-old's fuzzi bunz to get her through the night.So far, so good.Having them splay like this allows for much more reasonable drying times, and probably better washing too.I boiled mine, and they absorbed just fine after that.Once wet, they smell a bit different than the microterry I was used to, but it isn't bad.They're also thinner than microterry inserts, but seem to absorb at least as much.I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, so this observation is anecdotal and not empirical.Maybe I should bust out the blue liquid maxi-pad-commercial-style and see what does better.My only suggestion is this: for my purposes, I think I'd rather have two two-layer pads totally separate than bound together.This is an excelent product!!It really makes me feel secure about letting the baby's room door closed during the night.The only thing that could be better is the battery duration, which is nt a big deal.But be sure that the device is plugged in during the night or it has enough battery that will last all night specially if you let the door closed or if the bedrooms are not so close to each other.My husband and I love the product and really recommend it!The only bad experience I had was with shipping.They said it was lost some how with UPS.Then they shipped me another one, that did not arrived as well.So, for the third time they said they were going to ship me the iten, but this time I asked for the tracking number just to make sure everything was right.Then it worked!!!Arrived on time, and before baby's arrival!!!So much better than our last video monitor.The simple fact that you can remotely move the camera angle, and THEN zoom make this AMAZING.often times my baby would wiggle down to the bottom of the screen of my other monitor (Zopid) and we couldn't see her.When on battery power the video does shut off to save power, but the light and sound alerts stay on and you can hear everything going on in the room.You just have to push the video on button and you can see.If it's plugged in the video stays on.The camera can be mounted or sit on a shelf or nightstand.I was very excited to try out this monitor, as I had the old Summer Infant Day/Night monitor, and really wanted a digital one, that wouldn't get interfernce, and also absolutely loved the idea that you can remotely control the camera, especially now that we have moved our toddler to a "big boy bed", and he can get out on his own.However... the key thing in any monitor, is the sound and volume.This monitor, turned up to it's highest volume level, is only maybe half the volume level of the old one.This one doesn't even compare.I have returned it.Great product.Mounts easily to wall.We placed it near the ceiling so when our son is a toddler we could monitor his play in the room.Other reviews have noted the  difficulty of adjusting the volume.It is not a problem.You literally press one button and then move the joy stick to adjust the volume.Furthermore, I find that I leave the volume on "3 bars" all the time anyway.The only thing that I needed to modify was the lights on it.When there is sound in the baby's room the light stip along the bottom of the picture light up from green to red to indicate level of noise.However if you are running an air conditioner in the baby's room then the monitor lights are always in the red.Otherwise this is a terrific monitor!Updated Note: 4/2011:  We've owned this product for a year now, and the hand held monitor is no longer accepting a charge from the cord.So given that it works otherwise, we are stuck re-charging the batteries everday.Inconvienent, but overall I still think it's a good product.By the way, if you are looking at different monitors, I now know that it really doesn't matter if it has a color display.Since it goes to black and white at night anyway, you are always looking at the baby in black and white.I ordered both this and the Day & Night.The Day & Night became staticky after two days, so I returned it.I don't leave it on really.The lights on the monitor let me know if he's making noise in his room, and I can also hear him down the hall.I really like the pan/zoom on this monitor.The only thing is even if you zoom in (only 1x zoom) you still aren't able to see the baby's chest rise and fall.It's fun watching my toddler mucking around in his crib after I've put him in - I feel like a voyeur!But when I get the second camera for the newborn's room, I might still have to go into the room to see if he's breathing, as this video monitor isn't that awesome.I purchased this model after buying another one on Amazon that had horrible video quality.I am impressed with the video quality and love the pan and zoom feature that is adjusted with the hand held.I searched long and hard to find a video baby monitor that worked well.There are certainly improvements that can be made (location of volume controls, for example), but I swear by this monitor every night.There is little to no interference, the range and battery life are good and the panning is totally cool.The only problem (major, if important to you), is that this is an absolute wireless internet *killer.*  By my standards, that is acceptable right now, mostly because by the time my little one goes down, I'm ready to go down too!I'm really nervous about all of the comments about the picture and sound freezing up.Fingers crossed that's not an issue for us.Edit, 4 months later: Still going strong!The picture did freeze up twice, but the sound went with it, so we knew right away when we didn't hear my daughter's white noise machine.Turned it off and back on and it was fixed.It's literally happened twice in 4 months, so no big deal.Ours are always all on because we have that white noise machine so the sound is always on high.I really wish there was a way to turn off those lights.Otherwise, we love it!Edit, 6 months later: Finally got the wireless set up in our new house and there are no problems at all.Our router isn't 2.4, so that's probably why, but I was still worried and didn't need to be.It gives a clear picture, day or night.2.It is portable..we take it outside, to the mailbox, the yard, the kitchen, bedroom...3.We can zoom in on our little guy to see if his eyes are open and to hear him breathing.4.You can clip it to a bag or yourself if your hands are full.6.You can pan around the room.7.We've been using this for about a week.The screen is clear, you can zoom in or out.You can pan up, down, left, right.We decided to splurge and go for a video monitor and I'm so grateful we did.Now our son is 9 months old and having the video feature is sooooo helpful.Nine out of ten times he doesn't but we wouldn't know via audio only.I use the monitor in a pitch black nursery either at night or during the day with blackout curtains.The pan and zoom are great.A main reason I hadn't bought a video monitor before is that I didn't want anyone else to be able to tune in.As noted in other reviews, you have to turn on the video feature and hit menu in order to change the volume.Not a big deal to me, certainly not a deal breaker.The number one detractor is the lack of audible low battery warning.A red line appears on the device but not very in advance and often it turns off from no power before I see it.My audio monitor had a low power beep and I really wish this had one.My husband and I LOVE having a video monitor for our baby.It's just great to watch him sleep too.I love this monitor.However, the button on the top to turn the video on/off started sticking after only about 7 months of use.Buy 12 months, the button is just stuck.Of course we're past our 1 year warranty so we have to buy a refurbished monitor for $100.Argh!This thing really should last more then a year for $180.Frustrating.She relied on an audio only one.It worked well for her, but as they got older there were times she would like to see what they were doing.They often talk to each other as they settle down or as they are waking up.She has used this monitor for a few weeks and has already been glad she had it.In the past, when she would hear them talking in the morning, she would get up and take her shower, knowing she had a little while before they expected to get their breakfast.One morning, after she was using this, she heard her son fussing a bit.Rather than just going to take her shower, she took a peek and found he had his arm stuck between the crib side and the wall.She was so glad she had it so she could go and rescue him.When she puts them down for a nap, she finds herself watching them rather than taking advantage of the time she has to get something done!ETA:  I just returned from a visit to my daughter's.This monitor works very well.It has really been good to have since her son has learned to climb out of the crib.An audio only monitor would not allow us to know what was going on.It also picked up their father's snoring when he went in there to keep the little guy in his crib.The babies were awake, but he had fallen asleep, out of range, on the floor.The flashing people had been complaining about in the past must be fixed now because I have not seen a single flash while I have been n her room, nor on the monitor.I have it angled at her bed but can scan over to see her at the door trying to get out or zoom in on her during the night.The sound quality is by far the best of the monitors we have had.Almost no delay and I can hear her breathing at night even through her sound machine and heart beat music.We had 2 other video monitors before this and returned each one.This is the best and I would recommend it to all of my friends.My husband and I love this monitor!I still sleep in with my baby and my husband sleep in our room and I was always so scared to leave her unattended after she fell asleep at night.Now we can turn this on and watch her.Due to the pan motion we can watch her even if she wiggles all over her crib!I can't imagine my life without this monitor!I have a two month old and this product gives me so much freedom.Especially during the first few weeks when you are totally paranoid and want to make sure she is breathing all the time.It also allows me to run on the treadmill with my headphones on during her nap because I can just watch the video instead of having to listen for her.Greatly recommend this product.I'd have to say this is the single best thing I bought for my baby!I do agree the green light is annoying, but it does not bother her, in fact, one night we watched her smile and coo at the monitor for a few minutes before she fell asleep.This is a great video monitor.I love the zoom, pan and tilt options.I have to keep hitting the button on top to wake up the video feed.I know this is to conserve batteries but the choice should be left up to the user!It competes with my big wicker hamper.Small enough to fit anywhere but big enough to hold a lot of clothes and even a baby comforter.Decent quality.Not sure how it would hold up if completely full... we keep doing the babies laundry so haven't seen it at max capacity.This breastshield really helped to make my pumping easier.It reduced the pain, and I was able to actually get more than 1oz of milk, which was all that I could get using the standard 24mm.I was really disappointed that the BabiesRUs where I got my Medella Pump didn't carry these, but luckily they have them here.I have been dreaming about this stroller for 7 moons now - and I am very glad we finally have it and it lived up to our expectations!There are 280 + reviews for this stroller under more places for this on Amazon.I bought this to replace my  single Schwinn stroller.I am SO HAPPY I bought this instead of the Schwinn double jogger , because the same thing that is faulty about the single jogger is said to be true of the double jogger , the break falls repeatedly and makes it annoying to stroll or jog.The only thing I would add to this marvellous stroller is a hand-brake - but it is really not necessary.I am as in love with this stroller as one Mom could be.But now I can spread the good word.To remedy this, our doctor recommended a Bumbo chair.At the store, this (full price) was only 10 dollars more than a Bumbo.WOOHOO.My infant son loved to sit in the chair because he could see what was going on.He liked the tray, because he could grab the toys, play with them, and mouth them.It was also nice, because it took up less space than the exersaucer (which we also own) and did not put the extra pressure on hip joints like the exersaucer and walkers can.I love that it buckles.My son has been extremely strong since birth, and even with all his stretching, growing, pushing, and contorting, he cannot get out of the chair and be unsafe.(Think: shower time and cooking dinner time, not all day.)My 2 year old also loves this chair.My niece has been visiting, and because I have one in my high chair and one in my booster seat, that left no place for my toddler niece to sit for dinner.We quickly took the toy ring off the summer's infant chair, and voila--she had a booster.And, it is super easy to detach from the chair and use as a floor sitter again.(Not that my little one needs it, since he is sitting.)My two year old also loves the chair, since her brother likes it.She fits just fine, doesn't tip it over, and enjoys the toys for a few minutes.He could hold up his head up very well, but couldn't sit up at all.The seat is close fitting offering support throughout the leg and hip area.The sides come up high around the baby, which also offered support to prevent leaning over.I didn't need to use this because mine was big enough body-wise to fill out the seat by itself.It also comes with a tray that is a complete circle around the seat, which serves three purposes.My son is VERY strong for his age and has not managed to pull any of them off.I also had room on the tray to add a couple of those spinning suction toys.When not needed, the tray can be removed completely and you can just buckle the baby in.You get the same seat as a Bumbo but added advantages of the toys and using it as a booster seat.Also, no tight leg holes as some people complain of with the Bumbo.We have seem dramatic improvement in our babies sitting and the toys motivate them to stay upright.We're buying a second one!lightweight- No attached toys (might be a good thing if you are picky able what goes in the mouth)- Child often drops toys on floor even when there's a tray attached causing frustration- Leg opening really tight on chubbier legsSUMMER INFANTACTIVITY SEAT+ Attached toys give child something to look at, grab and mouth+ Don't need to keep picking up toys off the floor+ Can attach other toys to prexisting ones+ All the perks or an exersauer without taking up a lot of room- Made of cheap platic- Paint comes off toys over time (it's made in the USA so no lead, but still)I think the bumbo is popular because it's industructable and serves its purpose well (helps non-sitters sit), but if your child is like mine he/she will get really frustrated that he/she is stuck in this chair with nothing to do (except try to escape to retreave his dropped toys).Even though the Summer Infant seat is cheaply made, your child will most likely enjoy sitting in it (at least long enough for you to take a shower).We had loads of people recommend the bumbo for our little girl to help her learn to sit but this is essentially a bumbo with trimmings.She's only 4 months old but she'll happily sit in there for half an hour.Now that she's learnt to roll it's a really secure place to put her while I do housework and she can see me walking around and play with a soft book or rattle (she can't quite reach the toys yet).I love this product.Use it in the living room, move it to the kichen while cooking, and take it to the bedroom to show DVDs, or put it in the trunk and drop it off with your baby, take it to your friends' house to have some lunch together etc.Very portable.This product is very simple, but it works!I wish that the wedge was a little bigger so that it would hold the door open a little further, but other than that, it's great!these products are horrible.if you have a kid that likes to swing doors, they will immediately cause the door to come off the hinges.this product did it within 5 minutes of install.These are great because they stop fingers from getting caught at both ends of the door.Some of them have been cracked from an adult trying to close the door, but they still work fine.I recommend these to everyone I know with toddlers in their life.Even when I'm not worried about my little guy getting to the doorways, I use these to keep the doors from slamming when I have the windows open.One bit of advice--use them on the middle hindge of the door, as the force of the door trying to close can cause the door hinges to come loose if you put this on the top hindge.THis is a great product.I got 4-5 packs for all the doors in my house.it goes on the hinge of the door, so it prevents little fingers from getting pinched both at the hinge of the door as well as the opening of the door.It's in expensive and very useful.They do only allow the door to be closed half way, so these are only a good solution if you plan on keeping the door open while these are in place.This works when you don't want your child's finger to get stuck in the hinge.but if the door is pushed hard against the guard, then it can swing back pretty fast which can be dangerous.my daugher was trying to push the door to close and she gave it one big push and the door almost knocked her down!My daughter hunted high and low looking for that perfect crib set for her soon to be here daughter.She fell in love with this item and never changed her mind after previewing many other sets.I chose this set because it is not full of pink.I've seen so many bed sets that are mostly pink and different shades of pink...that's too much pink for me!The bumper fit well on my crib.We saw this set and were immediately drawn to the fun colors of it.There's so much you can do with decorating around the colors of the quilt.The colors are true to the Internet pictures: the green and blue are soft, the raspberry is a little brighter.We decorated the nursery in a soft green color like the pictures, and we too have maple wood floors.The free shipping is just an added bonus!!!The one small drawback is that I wish the sheet was a bit softer.I may buy a green sheet outside of this set.I cannot say enough about these bottles.We tried several glass bottles, including Dr. Brown's and Evenflo, before landing on Born Free.We added training handles, a sippy spout, and a silky slipper cover and our baby's bottle is a sippy cup.Even though it is pricey, when you consider that we can rearrange the parts of the bottle to become the sippy cups, we would have spent the same amount of money, and in my opinion the Born Free Bottles are a superior quality to the rest.You can't take a Toyota and say it's the same quality as a BMW...it just isn't.This $20 cup holder falls apart all the time.Thanks to the patented "spring bounce" action, the cup was clean of all coffee by the time we'd walked two blocks.I wouldn't have to clean the cup myself.Thanks, Uppababy!And the best thing?If you've got some cups that need to be emptied, buy this cup holder and let the engineers at Uppababy solve your cup cleaning problems for you while you take care of your kid.I understand that some of you purchased this product under the impression you would be able to keep a drink in it.I'm afraid you were mistaken.That's the bad news.The good news is you'll develop good arm muscle tone pushing the stroller with one hand.I HATE this cup holder, it was so expensive for what it is, the chain links are flimsy at best, and as per other reviewers it does, in fact, fall off all the time.Shopping with this thing is embarrassing, having such a nice stroller it is embarrassing when you are walking into things and it comes off spilling your hot coffee all over the stroller, your clothes and at times, merchandise that I DO NOT want to pay for!)This flimsy accessory is a huge rip off, do NOT fall for it, I think I might sell mine and get another  brand that fits on any stroller, a friend of mine has one and her's works perfectly.It does no such thing.Even walking of a smooth side walk, the coffee will spill as you walk across the side walk seam lines that attach each block together.It is the most poorly designed cup holder.We purchased this carseat adapter for our new Uppababy Vista stroller.It allows us to use our Chicco Keyfit 30 with the stroller for a secure snap-in fit.It is shockingly hard to find stroller frames that accomodate carseats that are not of the same brand, and when you do, some use flimsy straps and other things that I dont feel are secure at all.Grab the orange flap on the back of the carseat to release.It works very well for that purpose.The only draw back is the strap that goes around the cup can only  be tightened to far.Some of our cups slip out of the loop rendering this useless.Just make sure the Velcro is secure.We leave it on our co sleeper all the time and don't use the regular sheets.I can't seem to find these in the stores.I love these as burp clothes and I've sewn ribbon or fabric on them and given them as sets for baby showers and gifts!These don't have the extra padding in the middle so they're perfect for burping or wiping up messes.If you are reading this review and trying to make a well informed decision about this product you are already smarter than I was when I blindly ordered these.When I decided to cloth diaper my daughter I automatically went with gerber.I have several gerber prefolds that went through a friends four children and they are great.These, however are awful.I was so excited when the box came in the mail, yes I know who gets excited over something your child pee's & poo's in.They are so thin I could see the t.v.through the stupid thing.They did shrink up, they even quilted up quite a bit, but they leak even the smallest amount of spit up.Just imagine if it was pee or worse.Grrr.I might use these to scrub toilets at least that way they are coming close to their intended purpose.I cant find them in the stores.This bag looks great, I looked at a lot of bags before finally choosing this one.I can fit all the things i need in it, and I generally pack a lot because my baby spits up a lot and usually needs several outfit changes a day from spitting up all over.First off this bag is so stylish and cute!My other diaper bag was just a cheapo so I just love this one.I tucked the 2 handles straps into the bag so they wouldnt get in the way.I wish the 2 side bottle holders were a tad bit larger because sometimes I have to shove a larger bottle down into it.I would recommend this to any mom as it can be gender neutral and its super cute!I love this cover!The fabric I think is pretty soft after I had washed it.It's not so bad that it scratches, but it's not as soft as I would have liked.Plus, the fabric is pulling away from the zipper a little creating a hole.I don't know if I just got a bad one, but the two other boppy covers haven't ripped at all.I love the organic one with the peapods on it--VERY soft.I would steer clear of this fun spots print though.I really like the coloring and design of this bobby cover; however, the fabric isn't as soft as I anticipated.I also have the organic bobby cover (the off-white one with the little green pea pod).I like the feel of the organic cover much better.The website represents the appearance of this cover well though.I purchased this head support when I discovered my 6 week old baby's head had become slightly elongated due to a flat spot developing on the back of her head.I purchased it when she was 9 weeks old and within days I saw slight improvement (we also started holding her upright instead of the cradle hold sp that our arms don't put pressure on her skull).So far, it has been a week, but I already like this product and am recommending it to my pregnant friend.It's nice to be able to lay my baby down guilt free with this supporting her head so it's off the flat ground.I wish more mommy's knew about this product!My son is 4 months old and at his 4 mos check up our MD told us he is starting to get a "gumby" head, his head was flat on one side and begining to push one of his ears forward.We are doing tummy time etc but he sleeps a solid 10+ hours at night and favors one side of his head (probably because it was flat on that side).We bought this for his crib, and we use it in his bouncy chair.Within 2 weeks we saw a noticeable difference and i'm sure it will get better!Phew we will avoid having to go down the helmet route for positional plagiocephaly (flat head syndrome).We would have used this from the start!!Wish this qualified for free shipping...can't find this locally at any BRU or box stores.My daughter was born 5 weeks early and her head was a little elongated so by forcing her to sleep on her back without turning from side to side (her head that is), it has helped to that end.Since she has reflux she pretty much sleeps in her FP bouncer and I find the Noggin gives her nice head support as she is still quite small.Wow--I wish I had known about this product earlier.My son is 3 1/2 months old and had developed an assymetrical head from always looking to one side while in his bed.We started turning him around so that the flatter side would fill back out again but we weren't seeing quick results.After using the Noggin Nest for 2 or 3 weeks, we can already see a difference.If I had known about this product, I would have used it from day one.We use it in his carseat (fits perfectly in the Chicco Keyfit), swing, bouncy seat, and while he's on his play mat.I've washed it once and it held up well.Great product!I have to say I think this really worked.My baby started getting a flat spot on the back, right-handed side of his head.He was about 2 months old when I got this.I used it for naps and at nighttime.IT's super cute (bonus) plus that flat piece of material below the pillow sits under the baby so that when you place your baby on top of it, the baby's weight keeps the entire thing in place.I've seen other similar pillows that just have the pillow part on it and moms say that the pillow moves all over the place.It seemed that I was using it TOO much because the "Ring" shape from the hole in the pillow started to form on the baby's head!GAH!But as soon as I stopped using it, it went away :) It really did help his head look more round shaped instead of flat!After a couple weeks, I just bought a sleep positioner and let the baby sleep on his side (swaddled) for naps/bedtime.By 3 months, he was able to hold his head up really well so I let him sit in a Bumbo chair or put him on his tummy to play to relieve pressure on his skull.I will definitely keep this around and use it for the next baby.My little guy prefers to sleep on one side, and it was causing a noticeable flattening.The pediatrician had said to keep turning his head to the other side to prevent further flattening and to strengthen his neck muscles on the other side.I had bought this because I was hoping that I could place it in his crib so he could sleep in it.But when I received it (it was much smaller than I thought it would be) it said that it was not meant to be slept in.So I now use it in his bouncer (he spends a lot of his time in it) to keep him from turning to one side or the other too much.His flattening is definitely better but I'm not sure if it's because of this (or me turning his head in the middle of the night) but I would recommend it just because it provides good head support for your baby on a bouncer or a swing.My baby has a mild case of torticollis (tight neck muscle) and prefers to hold her head to the right.By the time she was a month old, I noticed that the right side of her head was developing a flat spot.I saw this product on Amazon, and ordered one right away.We use it during naps (supervised), when she is on her play mat, etc.Until she was about 3 months old, this prevented her from turning her head to the side.I then realized that it was a possible SIDS risk, because of the cushioning of the product.We now only use it during the day time.In my assessment they have two major problems.The first problem is that the nipples are poorly designed and crack.This is dangerous because it causes the milk to gush into the baby's mouth.(This happened with all three of our nipples in short order.)Plus, they are super cute.As an aside, I find the poor quality of these bottles surprising given the fact that I have been happy with other Munchkin brand products (the dishwasher basket, the bottle brushes, etc).I have a bunch of these bottles, and I just love them!They are really easy to clean and use.I personally didn't use the nipples provided because I didn't like them to start off with, so I had purchase another set of nipples that fit, and everything works like a charm!I have all different colors, and must admit I Have been almost using these a year and never have had to thow one out.I would buy again!I love how you can take the top off and put it on your big potty and the bottom turns into a step stool.Elmo does stick out a bit far, so when she sits on it to potty, he preemptively congratulates her, but she likes it!The only problem with this chair is that when she's not pottying she still sneaks away to "play" with Elmo by pushing him so that he talks to her.Elmo can get a little annoying but the kids love to listen to him and it keeps them entertained while they're sitting on it.Our family has also had problems with these cups: the short straw, the leaking on its side, the volcanic spewing of liquid up and out the straw at random times, etc.We bought these hoping they would be better than the Munchkin brand cups we already had, but no way.Even though the Munchkin ones leak a little bit, it is not nearly as bad as these Playtex cups.These ALWAYS leak!I didn't really notice how much they leaked until I started putting milk in them instead of water.I only fill it halfway and it still leaks up from the top and sometimes it will just leave puddles wherever your child sets it down.It also really upsets my 2 yr. old daughter when the milk leaks and it's especially annoying when it leaks on our rug, carpets or in her carseat.Please do not waste your $$$ on these!!!This is a great product and use it for my 12 month old child.The only down side is occasionally it will leak if left on it's side.I feel as if I wasted my money here.Normally I LOVE The First Years products as I own theThe First Years miPump Single Electric Breast Pump,The First Years Quick Serve Bottle WarmerandThe First Years Soothie Newborn Pacifiers, Boy- all are products I adore but these are NOT EASY by any means and my two week old son busts his arms out of the top of these so easily (that's if I can get his arms to stay inside in the first place) and this defeats the purpose.I purchased theThe Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle, Newborn Short, Kiwi Greenand it worked like magic.Please don't waste your money!When I ordered this, it had some negative reviews on the target site from other users who said it was too small to fit on the carts in their area.Maybe it wouldn't fit on super large carts, but I have not encountered a cart it wouldn't work on yet...I use it at grocery stores, Wal Mart, etc.It seems to fits carts better than restaurant high chairs (it's big and moves around on them), but works for that too.My only complaint is that I can't set it up while holding my baby...so I find myself trying to park by the cart racks, set it up on a cart, and then put my baby in it when shopping alone.It holds up well with washing, although I air dry it instead of using the dryer.It has been very usefull, even to use it as a co-sleeper when my baby got the flu, and when we where overnight away from home.We own three of these gates.On the top and bottom of our stairs and in a doorway.The walk-through opening isn't a wide as I'd like but not many of these type gates have wide openings anyway.It installs instantly, and we have had it for 2 months and did not have to adjust it at all after installing it.It stays firmly in place, and is super convenient!We use it to keep the dog out of the baby's room.It keeps our 90 pound boxer out, so I'm sure it can keep babies/kids where they need to be as well!UPDATE: PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS CHANGED MODELS SINCE I WROTE THE FOLLOWING REVIEW.PLEASE SEE UPDATE 2013 COMMENTS ON THE NEW MODEL AT THE END....We needed a baby gate that was wide enough to put at the bottom of our stairs (about 41 inches), but other extra wide gates were expensive once you had to get the extensions to make them wide enough or you had to hardware mount them to the wall and who wants to screw things into their wall?Or, in our case, the banisters on one side of the stairs.So I'd say this version seems to have corrected whatever problem the older model had.A tip for attaching it to a banister on one side, just velcro strap a board to the flat part of the banister so the pressure mounts have something to press against.A note.... the gate will look like it's broken and won't close properly if you hold it up straight out of the box.It's the pressure put on the gate when it's mounted that ensures it closes properly.And, a note for the surprising number of people who have gotten worked up thinking this is a "fake" manufacturer generated review..... it's not.While it's been very entertaining over the years to see people who have the time to get worked up over my review of a baby gate, I have no affiliation with the Regalo company other than as a satisfied customer.:)UPDATE 2013: We're kind of annoyed that Amazon has kept all of the old reviews after Regalo changed product models and now probably most of the reviews you seee here which now no longer apply to this new model.It appears that the "Regalo Easy Open 52 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate" now fits the description of the gate we have that I wrote the original review for and that's the one we're getting after we send this "new model" back.The old mechanism was very easy to use one-handed.It was simply a spring loaded thumb lever.Check out the closeup of the latch for the "Regalo Easy Open 52 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate" which appears to still have the old latch mechanism and compare it to the closeup of the "EasyStep Walk Thru" mechanism.I should note that my husband has large hands and is technically able to open it one handed by pushing the lever with his thumb (instead of pulling it back as intended) and then using his other fingers on the same hand to kind of nudge the other latch up out of the way but he thinks it's ridiculous and I definitely can't physically do it.We have a number of baby gates in our homes, and this one is my least favorite.I would not choose it for an opening you use often, because it is narrow (my husband and I find ourselves turning sideways to get through it most of the time) and clumsy to maneuver through.I removed it from its first spot and put it in another spot we use less often, but it's still getting on my nerves.I hate how high the bottom bar is, we trip over it all the time.It's cheap, but I would put the money toward another better gate costing 50% more.We have a 47 inch doorway and wanted a gate that was pressure mounted, not screwed into the wall, so our choices for baby gates were very limited.The only way we were able to get the gate to fit into the doorway (just barely) was to remove the knobs from one side to make the length of the gate a little shorter.If I were using the gate for a child, I would be concerned that a toddler standing up and leaning on the gate might be able to push it down.My son will stare at the animals but yes the music is annoying!There is a setting for the amount of time the music plays but it can't turn off fast enough lol.He doesn't care if it's on though so it's a good buy.I find it comforting to watch him when I'm driving or in the passenger side.Not only that the mirror itself was BORING to my child and even though there was music and a remote and a light I didn't like it and my son had no interest in it either.So- after a long hunt through mirrors, I found this one and SO HAPPY I did.We have 2 cars but it was very hard to install this product on both of our cars.I bought this about 4-5 month ago and it did not work.So I ordered replacement, and that broke after a few times use also.Just a coincidence or what?I was being lazy and didn't try to return it for a while.This product work for 10 seconds then stopped working.Now I can only use as an mirror and it plays no music.I could have saved money and bought just a plain mirror for half the cost.Wanted to keep her off of public surfaces this winter espec in flu season.What an excellent high chair cover and for such a great price!I also love the loops in the front that you can clip toys and rings to for the child to play with.Great high chair cover!Find it hard to remember to bring it with me all the time.It is rather bulky to always carry in the diaper bagThis highchair cover isn't padded or thick.It's simple to put on, folds up into a package that fits into a diaper bag, and does the job of covering a high-chair at a restaurant.I've seen thicker ones that are more padded.That might be better for a younger child who needs extra stability.It also doesn't double as a shopping cart cover, so you'd have to get a separate one of those.There's nothing wrong with this product, but it doesn't have anything that makes me want to rate it 4 or 5 stars.It is literally "just OK." On the upside, it's inexpensive.Pro: Holds toys in a colorful, fun way.Con: Several of the suction cups have chronically weak hold; they let go and the whole thing sags.This is a handy, little toy organizer but is hardly the golden ticket to our bath toy storage solution.We do not overpack it but the netting is sagging on the toy.Basically looks like a piece of trash in the bathtub, awful.The mildew smell is actually gotten worse since we got the organizer- although I am not sure if it is necessarily to blame.Appparantly bi-weekly sanitizing of the toys/carrier is not enough.I would recommend getting the Boon Frog or Ladybug organizer.I like my travel system, although it is a bit heavy and bulky (I use my snap n go for quick trips, this for more substantial walks).I think it's best compared to, well, not quite an SUV but one of the crossover cars....It nicely reclines all the way and the handles seem to be high enough for my husband and I to comfortably use (I'm 5'10", he's 6'1").Loved the pattern--was a bit sad to see that it is now offered at Babies r Us b/c I loved how unique it is (could only find it online back then)...I also like that you can close it up when you draw the stroller cover down to meet the car seat awning.Car seat does seem to make my little girl a little sweaty, as other reviewers had mentioned.Safety is obvious, and price was of course a factor, but what else?Easy to set up & take down?We went to many stores & tried out every model, then we'd come home and read the Amazon reviews, and the ones we liked would have negative comments that would make us doubt our decision, so we'd start the search all over again.It seemed like no one liked their stroller/car seat.I'm sure some of you out there are having the same trouble, so for those of you hung up like I was on the negative comments, I would like to give you a different perspective on some of the other reviews.Just because there is a "con" doesn't mean it's a dealbreaker - these things are livable!It is not the cheapest, but not nearly the most expensive.We bought a Graco first and didn't like it - the carseat on this locks so much easier into the base and the stroller, and it also feels much sturdier, smoother, and better put together than the Graco.2.It steers easily, it's smooth, and the handle feels comfy.3.The stroller is very simple to unfold & fold, and the carseat could not be any easier to lock in place.5.She falls asleep & stays asleep in it often.NOW, TO ADDRESS SOME SUPPOSED DRAWBACKS:1.It makes them easy to clean).It doesn't seem to bother her at all.2.Our baby has been in the 75-90th percentile for height & weight since 2 months, and no trouble fitting.And I can't imagine how anyone could have trouble locking in the carseat unless it was broken.We literally tried every model at Babies R Us and Buy Buy Baby, and this was the easiest one to lock in.3.I consider myself a full-fledged wimp, and I could handle either.I use a carrier of some type instead of toting the seat by itself when possible.Not a big deal.4.When using the seat with the stroller, unless you have a very narrow diaper bag, it will be hard to get it under the seat, and you won't be able to fit some shopping items under there.Again, not a big deal - use a mommy hook or carry the bag on your shoulder.You don't need tons of heavy stuff in your bag when the babies are that young.It felt like people were always watching us thinking we were shoplifting.The adult beverage holder is too shallow.If you hit a bump, your drink will probably spill.We live in the suburbs, so we use this for shopping, but we also take it on a pretty rough sidewalk about 1/2 to 1 mile every day.We also have large vehicles, so no trouble fitting the stroller.Another caveat, either one of us does the grocery shopping while the other keeps the baby, or we both go & one pushes the cart and the other pushes the stroller, so if you have to do lots of shopping alone & with baby, there may be a better product for you since the carseat does take up most of a shopping buggy & the basket is difficult to access.A bit big - so I was eager to see if he would be ready for a walker.The toys are cute and I love the sounds.He will sit in this happily for at least 30 minutes.He can hold his head up very well now and needed something a little more active to enjoy.I had previously owned the Jeep walker, and I never owned anything Chicco before.It is easy to put together, even with a crawling baby tugging at your feet.He is almost 9 months old and this will grow with him as he is not on the tallest setting yet.Before you buy, test out any walker on your baby:I have a tall baby who has been mistaken for a one year old since he was 4 months old.When he was 5 months, my husband, my baby and I went shopping for a walker.Initially, we planned on buying the Combi walker that resembles a car.Since the store did not have any other walkers that were sturdy, we went home discouraged.I decided to search the internet for other brands that we didn't consider and someone recommended this one.Height settings: It has 3 of them and the lowest is the height of the tallest on the Combi.He also tries to reach for things, sometimes stretching toward the floor and the walker does not budge.The plastic that is made out of is very good quality unlike a wobbly Jeep walker that we saw in the store constructed out of cheap and thin plastic.3.The tray play center:  It has 3 settings of music, animal sounds, and a combination of the two and he loves to play with it.In fact, I love to play with it.It's really easy to install it (one quick snap) and very easy to remove (not easy for baby to remove) so your baby can use it when he's out of the walker or after he grows out of it.My only concern after looking at this website is the color of it - mine is light green and yellow and the one pictured here is multicolored.There is also no indicator that tells you which setting you are on so it may take several tries before you figure out which setting it's on.Although it flattens easily for transport, there is no lock to keep it that way so even though it's flat, it opens right back up as you carry it.3.Putting the fabric on the seat when you put it together for the first time can be painful to your fingers.(Hopefully it will never get dirty).I highly recommend this walker.He can barely touch the ground on tippy toes, but he likes the toy center that comes with it.He smacks around on it and gets real excited.(he is pretty lazy) I like that it comes with brakes, it makes me feel much better about him getting hurt.Overall a very good walker, would recommend.I went back and forth on whether to get a walker.I read the reviews, the admonishments, all the negative warnings about using a walker but I kept going back to the simple fact...I used a walker as a baby and I know how to walk just fine.So I first purchased a different, low-tech BRU walker.We problem solved with this DJ Baby Walker.He's 31+" now and there is still room to raise the walker if we need to.I have had 4 months of blissed daily-use from the walker.My son relentlessly chases the dogs.Can stop and turn on a dime.He love to ram into the vaccumm (I suspect it is his nemesis) - and the best part is the walker doesn't go up any changes in floor levels so he can zoom around the living room, dianing room and hallway, but cannot get into the kitchen, bathroom or bedrooms.And, whats more, it isn't just a toy but a crash-course for parents in  childproofing... with a buffer (great for those first time parents who have no idea what little hands can do) -  because of the size of the play tray - he reaches for but cannot grab most things...So if it delays walking by a few weeks...I can live with that.I would have liked a grey or light green stroller.But if the next baby is a girl I will be disappointed about the color choices again.- Cannot see through the plastic "window".- Canopy comes off sometimes when folding it up.But it snaps back on easily.- Rough-handling (by in-laws or babysitters) can damage handle grips.We've been using this stroller for over 5 months now.It's easy to steer and it very durable!People stop and ask us about this stroller all the time.It's great looking, affordable and I'm able to take it on LONG walks, up and down hills with no problems.After I ordered this product I saw several name brand strollers at a local shop so I had planned on returning this stroller to save some money and buy a lightly used name brand stoller for less than half the price of this one.Turns on a dime.Only one complaint, it's difficult to get to undo the buckle but then again it's probably a good thing so older kids can't unbuckle themselves.Great product, worth the extra money.I just got my stroller today and loving it, is so easy to handle, light and it reclines practically flat, I like the 5 points harness wich many other umbrella stroller I liked the look where lacking of, my baby moves too much I need a 5 point harness to keep him secure, I like the little space this occupies in my trunk, and the easyness of folding, the peek window is good cause even though does not have a cover is a dark transparency wich no much light will go through if He falls sleep.And so far so good.mine is exactly that one red and gray and is very nice, also Amazon actually has the best price for this stroller and the Prime 2 days shipping can't be beated!I bought this about six months ago to put my son's lunches in to take to day care.The container we use the most is the bento box.My son's main lunch goes in that every day.We've never had a problem with anything spilling into his bag.We also use the two bowls frequently to send in snacks like cut fruit.The cup that comes with the set isn't that useful and we don't really use it.The fork and spoon that come with it also aren't my favorite.Both are small, too small for a toddler, and the fork doesn't actually stick anything well so we ultimately don't use those either.My one suggestion would be to consider just buying the bento box, which is sold seperately.However, we used it for a total of 30min.The helmet gets so hot, the baby was dripping sweat within 5 minutes of having this on.I read the reviews about this problem, but figured it would be ok since it was winter when we bought it, and we keep the house cooler than the average person.I dread to think of parents putting this on a baby in the summer.It would be borderline dangerous.Supervise your baby and save your $$$.Update 6/2012Having mentioned that this is not a good product should not deter you from finding something else suitable.I don't think that we should overprotect our children, but head injuries are serious.My 2.5 year old slipped on a wet tile floor and had major behavior changes for 3 weeks as a result.So although in my case, I was sure the head bump affected my child, three different doctors told me it was okay as long as he didn't throw up.(I was about to throw up at them for being so useless.)Pre-verbal children may not be able to articulate what they feel and how the head bump affects them.Supervise your children, re-configure your living areas, wash your floors only when children sleep, and why not, try to find some kind of contraption that protects accident-prone children.And he refuses to wear it.The head gets super sweaty and hot so beware of overheating.It was a waste of money for us, but he's so darn cute in the hat with the ears.Just beware the return policy on this product is NOT friendly before purchasing-- I think they take about $10 off if you return it?In any case, if your baby hates it, there's really no point in returning it and you're left with a funny $50 item that worked for a day.When we purchased our new car my husband was particular about 1 thing.He worried the car seat would crack the leather over time.So we purchased this.It has nice deep side slits to allow the LATCH to buckle easier and the storage pouch on the bottom is great for small toys- the pouch is small so think, MatchBox cars, little McD's/Bk toys and pacifiers.And it's thin so I have no fear of it interfering with the safety of my child.With the impending arrival of #2 we have already purchased a second one.I have a Delta Jasmine crib, which my 15 month old toddler bit a piece of wood off of the side of the crib.I contacted Delta's customer service department and they were not willing to do anything about the damage.I spoke with a customer service rep, as well as his supervisor.They were very rude, telling me that it's my fault for not having teething rails on the bed.Even after I explained this was on the side rail and the first bite she took, a piece of wood came off of the crib into her mouth.Fortunately an adult was there and was able to get the wood out of her mouth.The supervisor hung up on me after I asked to speak with his boss.It's really sad that Delta does not back up their products or care about the consumers that keep them in business.This review is to let consumers considering a Delta crib to know if anything does go wrong with the crib to not expect Delta to do anything about it.I have filed a report with the CPSC, so hopefully they can help with the wood issue.It'd be terrible for a toddler to bite off a piece of wood and something serious happen.....I ordered this crib in the Antique Black finish, and it is exactly what you'd expect it to be - it's DISTRESSED not SCRATCHED!!There is not so much distressing that it needs to be paired with vintage looking crib bedding or anything, it's just enough to look pretty.This crib is very sturdy and the finish seems really durable.The black DaVinci that I saw at Target could literally be gouged with a fingernail, so good luck once your baby is teething.The wood used in this crib is harder, so it is of course more durable.My husband was able to put this together with the help of my 11-year old son in less than an hour, and he is not handy at all.Also good to know is that a standard crib mattress fits perfectly into it - no gaps.I had read another review of this crib somewhere that swore there was a giant gap around the whole thing, but we did not find that to be true at all.Another good thing to know is that it does come with the toddler bed rails, but not with the rails to use it as a headboard/footboard.The first hole is pretty high and you would need to lower it pretty quickly once the baby was a few months old.We have a few more months before baby arrives, but in regards to the crib, all parts arrived in the box and my husband had no trouble at all putting it together.So far, so good.I was able to see the Da Vinci crib in person at Target and think that the wood on this Delta one is a little harder and much less likely to get scratched up.I'll update this review if anything changes once we get the mattress set up.Update: 2012We LOVE this crib!Our son is almost three and it's now a convertible toddler bed.Also, when he got to the age where jumping out was an issue, we just put the mattress on the carpet with the crib surrounding it.Worked well.I got this a year ago, and it has worked very well since.I carry it every where in the baby's diaper bag.It was worth what we pay.We were BFing and had tried Breastflow first, but was a disaster for us.Then, my mom randomly bought us a NUK to try -- a complete miracle!!We were desperate cause it was almost the time we wanted to wean him, and couldn't find a bottle so we thought we'd have to skip right to a sippy cup.But upon putting it in his mouth, he IMMEDIATELY knew what to do.It didn't gag him.Used MAM bottles first, but they had too many parts, therefore it leaked and it was a PAIN to clean.MUCH easier to clean and they don't leak!These are the ONLY bottles my baby will drink from.After shopping around and looking at nipples, I tried these and my baby loves these!This sippy cup has an air hole on the opposite side of the spout baby drinks out of and it leaks if baby turns it around and tips it - also, baby likes sticking his finger in that hole which makes it worse.This product is great!The only cons I have with it are the sippy nipple is tougher than other brands (i.e.Nuby), causing some resistance to switching.It also stinks that there are no ounce markings, making it hard when measuring out water for formula.We have six of them and use them every night.The regular blankets never stayed swaddled and we worried about constricting baby's legs too much.And they stay swaddled.I can't recommend this product highly enough.The swaddle also helps her to sleep longer, and it keeps her little hands warm at night so that they're not ice blocks in the morning.My daughter used hers so much that we had to get a new one when she was only 2 months old.Totally worth it, though.I'd buy them again in a heart-beat.Please note that this product is the microfleece, and therefore not good for summer or tropical babies.I had this product listed on my baby registry.I took it out of packaging and washed the item according to the products instructions.I was very disappointed.I still use the item due to the winter weather, but want to warn potential buyers.product does not fit quite as snug onto the seat as pictured, but still ok to me.This product is a must for anyone with a baby!I love that I don't have to worry about my baby's blanket dragging or falling on the ground with this product!It's perfect for cooler (not cold) weather that we experience here in PA during the beginning of spring, summer nights and fall.I would recommend this product highly to anyone I know that's expecting or who already has a baby!I returned it to walmart as defective but I've read similar reviews so I think that the product design is flawed.I'd recommend babycomfynose instead.All aspirators work better if you use nasal saline solutions like physiomer, because they loosen all the yukkies in the nose first, it's easier for your baby to use the solution first.The smaller tip sucks virtually nothing and the larger one almost caught a bit of what was blocking the nose but i had to pull it out with the standard aspirator.Maybe useful when the baby is much older (mine is 4 months old), but so far it's useless to me.Unfortunately, my baby's cold lasted longer than this little gadget did.Would not recommend and definitely wouldn't buy again.Beco Butterfly II Organic Carrier is very soft & comfortable.I purchased this carrier when my son was 5 months old since he was too long & the weather was too hot for me to carry him in my Moby Wrap (which I carried him in since he was born).I was torn between the Beco and Baby Hawk.I decided to go with the Beco because I could wear my baby on my front or back.I also wanted a carrier that my husband (6"0) and I (Pettie & 5"0) could both wear comfortably.I never used the infant insert but it is good that the carrier came with it.The DVD that came with my carrier would not play, so I watched a youtube video on how to wear baby, how to switch baby from front to back, how to use the infant insert, how to use the carrier as a hip seat when not in use, and how to use the head rest.My son falls asleep with no fussing.My son loves to be worn on my back since he can look around at everything.My husband was not happy with the price of this carrier, but the first time he used he was so impressed!He said it was money well spent and that he loves being to wear our son.The Head rest is very handy since holds the baby's head while asleep, but also blocks the sun & wind from baby's face.I Highly recommend this carrier!Both my husband and I love our Beco carrier!!We have been using it with our baby since he was just a few weeks old and he loves being close to us when we're out in public.Our baby is five months old now(over 15 pounds), and it's still just as comfortable now as it was when he was just a few weeks old.I could never get used to wearing my baby in a sling so I finally decided on a soft carrier.It was down to this and the Ergo and I happened upon a video on YouTube that demonstrated how you can hike the baby onto your back without worrying about dropping the baby because of the cloth insert between you and the baby (I think that's what makes this the "butterfly") that isn't present in other carriers.That is what sold me on this brand and I think it's genius--I can put the baby in this carrier and get him onto my back with no help from anyone else.The other thing that's great is that he's fallen asleep while my husband was wearing him and we were able to transfer the baby to me without waking him up, again thanks to the cloth piece that lies between you and the baby.Another thing I love about this carrier (besides the pretty designs!)is the hood that snaps on.It's great for cradling the baby's head or creating shade so he can sleep.I love this carrier!It has great support.It makes it simple to carry a baby (or toddler) as long as you need to.I call it the "nap maker" since my 2 year old falls asleep every time he rides in it!This carrier fits me and my husband!It is pretty simple to use and mine came with an instructional DVD.My Beco definitely gets much more use than my stroller!(In fact, my stroller sits in my garage collecting dust.)It is definitely worth the money spent on it!Our daughter loves being held in the front position and falls asleep almost immediately once we strap her in.Best of all it came with the infant insert and isn't super bulky like some of the other carriers available out there.Thet all RAVE about it because it hooks to anything.The dad's like it to because they can carry a clean pacifier without having to have a big bag with it in it.Fits a wide variety of pacifiers and keeps a clean pacifier handy without  having to dig for it when it's needed.This is a cute little bag for the pacifier, and it certainly helps that it can snap onto the diaper bag-- that way you always know where to look and you're not digging around in a binky emergency.The thing I don't like about it is that it squishes the pacifier because it's not wide enough to hold it, so you end up folding the nipple of the paci over to squeeze it in.Just seems strange that a product called a "Pacifier Pod" doesn't seem to be shaped to actually fit a pacifier...I've seen other pacifier holders that are cylinder-shaped and these seem much better to fit a pacifier or even two, without bending.It holds two pacifiers and I had no issues with them being "squished".I love that it attaches to the handle of my diaper bag for easy access.The inside of the pod is plastic, so it's totally water-proof.It also is a great way to keep your paci's clean while you store them.I also love the cute designs.I definitely recommend this product.This is one of those tings new mommies look at and wonder, "How did my parents ever survive without one of those?"Then you buy it and you quickly learn it's because it's completely useless.This kept it from falling, and also made it unnecessary for me to use a bag at all.If I needed to put it away, I just threw it in the diaper bag (which is clean, and I'm not a germaphobe).Also, the snap on the loop always came open, so I couldn't trust it on the diaper bag strap.That's the whole reason I thought it'd be cool...so I didn't have to dig through the diaper bag for the binky.But I ended up having to keep it in the bag anyway because it would just fall off.Now my older son thinks it's a cute purse and shoves little things in it.What an odd shape and size for a pacifier bag.It's very thin.It looks cute but it's not very functional.I ended up getting a Nuk case from Target.Bought this for my daughter, and she has been sleeping in it every night for the past 6 weeks.I don't plan on moving her from this until she gets too big for the "newborn napper" and I don't see that happening for at least another month (she's almost 9 lbs now).There are a few drawbacks, but should not discourage anyone from purchasing.1) the changing station is not completely flat and baby will slightly roll to the side if not placed just so in it2) the lights on it are not very bright, work great for finding pacifier and seeing baby but that's about it3) would have loved to see this in a pink, or more gender neutral colorOn the plus side:1) batteries last forever.we use the light and vibration mode every night, multiple times a night and will just now have to replace batteries2) very easy to assemble, and very light weight- not too heavy to move around3) love that the diaper stacker is removableWe bought both this particular Graco pack n play and an Arms Reach co-sleepers, and we're going to order a second pack n play for our bedroom and put away the co-sleeper for now.I had to deliver early and our baby was considering just borderline preemie, and honestly the napper is the best thing for him to sleep in.The napper is contoured and he can fall asleep in it without any problems and we don't have to worry about him rolling over.Honestly, babies 'nap' in 2-3 hour spurts, so this unit is great for us.After an unexpected c section I was not able to go up and down stairs for a few weeks.Our master bedroom is on the main floor and baby's room on the second floor.We put this pack n play in our bedroom and our little guy sleeps and is changed in it.My baby was 8lb 8oz and the changing table feature has never been a problem.He's never rolled to the center and the changing table has never sagged with is weight.He's very cozy in the napper and sleeps well at night.The only downside to this pack n play is that the newborn napper is really tough to install and get out.So if you need to move the pack n play it's kind of a pain if you have the napper installed.The canopy that comes with it is useless but we really like the wipes and diaper holder.Overall I would totally buy this pack n play again and would recommend it to friends.My baby was a preemie and I used the napper all the time for the first few months.For this alone, I would recommend it.On the bad side, the changer table was not sturdy and we could not use it (it would tilt to one side when baby was placed on it).That part was useless so that is why I gave it 4 stars.These things are a great idea, but with two big flaws, IMO.First, the quantity they hold is so small, the whole set of four doesn't fit enough snack to satiate a 3yo.So it may be good for formula or snacks for a small toddler, but that's about it.It's also too hard to open.I have a hard time with it, but my kids can't do it at all.And most snacks they eat are too big to fit out the dispenser hole, so the lid would have to be taken off to access them (and they can't do that).It occupies less space in the schools frige and in my diaper bag.Typically I stack breakfast(cheerios and such) in the first, the second and third have lunch( one has bread, the second some protein), the fourth container has fruits for snack time.When we travelled with him, it was easiest to carry food on us, even in the car.I recommend buying two.My entire condo is tile on cement so the floors are very unforgiving.This is a must have even if you don't have hard floors it can protect them from busting their head on a table corner or just falling on a hard toy.Don't hesitate.Its hands down my favorite baby product that we own.Very soft and stretchy blankets - we ordered the blue set, and the colour is nice, not an obnoxious blue.I put it on the toilet and the overhang lip in the front does not hang over enough.If it did, I think it would help keep it in place better.However, the cushions on the underneath (wish they would show you that on the product images) are just that, a cushion.It has nothing to do with actually helping hold the potty seat in place, as it slides around all too easily.It snapped open well and I felt it was good, but once I sat my 16month old 21lb girl on it, I better understand the reviews others are giving.Although it's snapped together pretty solidly, when I put my daughter on it, she seat really sunk in toward the toilet water a bit, enough to worry me too much to keep it.My main issues with the seat though are that it:1 - had nothing to click it/stick it on the seat to keep it in place2 - sinks down under the weight of my 21 lb girl3 - I can see my own hands getting unsanitary from touching the seat to open and close it after being on the toiletI think it's a great idea, but not a well developed/made product to do the job it's supposed to do.I bought this for my daughter a few weeks ago, we're in the midst of potty training.I didn't know what to do about the *huge* public toilet seats, and I found this potty seat.It folds up small and into a little zip-top baggie that fits well into a medium-large purse or diaper bag.I've been extremely disappointed with it.The bottles ruined my baby's latch although I didn't realize the cause until I switched to a different bottle.He stopped opening his mouth wide to latch onto my breast do to the tiny tip on the bottle nipple.My baby can't empty all the milk from the outer nipple once there is no milk left in the bottle.He swallowed A LOT of air because the inner nipple blocked milk from getting to the tip from inside the outer nipple.It was miserable to clean so many nipples too.Got very tiring.The bottles discolored with an orange hue as soon as I boiled them.First, the milk collects between the two nipples during drinking, which means you have to stop feeding often to squeese the milk back into the bottle.Second, maybe my son has a small mouth, but a lot of milk would spill out the sides of his mouth (more than with other bottles.I purchased several of these bottles/nipples after we started daycare and my daughter was getting nipple confusion from the Gerbers that fit onto my pump.After about a week of use, I found that the nipples retained the "left sitting out" breastmilk smell and I couldn't get it out.I washed the bottles and nipples in hot soapy water and sterilized from time to time to make sure all the bacteria was destroyed.Unfortunately, after another month of use, my to my horror, I discovered that the inner, darker blue nipples had deteriorated at the opening and either expanded on their own (because I certainly didn't shove anything in there to clean the very opening surface) or split down the side of the nipple (about "!)I immediately looked at the other nipples we have been using and found that every single nipple had that problem.Now, either I have toxic milk - which I highly doubt - or the material is not of the best quality.I called the company the very next morning and told them about this problem that I was having with the nipples.The "customer service" lady took an accusatory tone and said that I must be cleaning them wrong because she'd never heard of that.She said that I only needed to use a soft cloth.Then she offered to send me a replacement nipple pack "just this once."Ok, um, thanks.I received the replacement pack and immediately put them to use.After a week of use, I inspected them again.Guess what I found?!The tips were starting to split - about 1/8-1/6" down the side of the blue inner nipple.I called the company again to tell them about this.Got a different customer service rep and she apologized, asked how I was caring for the nipples and then offered to send me 4 replacement nipples but asked if I would please send them the defective nipples because they are very concerned.I got the replacement packaged, opened it up, and found not 4 replacement Stage 1 nipples but two bottles of the stage 2, 9 oz size.I'm not going to bother with sending them the defective nipples.I am not the only person that's having this issue as other reviewers online have reported the same occurrences.Save your money and try something else.These don't appear to have a very long lifespan.I like the idea, but it just doesn't last.We're switching to another bottle.These bottles make it so easy to go from breast to bottle.My daughter has a very strong latch, and she's not learning any bad habits (biting, shallow latch) from using these.It gives Daddy the chance to help out with feedings, and makes me feel OK about using a bottle.Okay, this product stinks.The concept is great, but the product isn't.The spinning thing is quite hard and not comfortable to lay on for long periods.We have 3 tummy time mats, and this one is by far the worst quality.It constantly bunches up and is pilling even though it's barely been used.The bunching up issue is even worse since the mat/spinner set are designed so a baby would really be grabbing onto the mat while spinning - so you'd think the mat would be a little sturdier to grab onto, but the way it is, it's really hard for the baby to grab and spin.He took to it right away and enjoys playing with each of the rings and reaching for the ball (when it's all together).My husband likes to roll it around on the floor around the baby and place it so the baby has to crawl and turn around to get to it.The Petite Consumer review:Scrubbles are a set of interchangeable bath squirt toys for ages 9 months and up.Not to mention you can actually clean the inside of this squirt toy!My son loves the one shaped like a rocket.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they don't squirt very far or very vigorously.I love that they are easy to clean and are interchangeable.I did have to shove the tube of butt paste down the side but it fits ok.This is definitely meant to be used with either a diaper bag that doesn't come with a changing pad or when you don't want or need a full diaper bag with you.This will be nice when my baby is older and I don't need a full diaper bag; I can just put the Pod in my purse and we'll be good.This is my third diaper kit.Or if it's a quick trip in and out, the diaper bag stays in the car and this goes in with us.But I just used the one that came with my old diaper kit.Inside the bag I can fit the wipes case, which is very thin, and I can squeeze in two size 4 diapers and three size 1 or 2.That's the whole point.But his head will start to hang off of it at about 4 months or so.I personally don't mind.I really can't imagine a kit having a pad that's large enough for a big baby or toddler.My original case fell apart in about 6 months.The one after that was HUGE and all one connected piece, which was annoying.This one is compact and durable.Plus it's very cute.the only downside is that it is basically a diaper clutch, so you lose one of those all important hands when you're hauling around b&eacute;b&eacute;.Were it to have a shoulder strap it would be a flat out winnerI have 3 kids and got it for my third.I stick disposable diaper bags in the back pocket.It clips on my little cooler, stroller, purse, anywhere!Would recommend this to anyone.I keep it in my diaper bag always, but I can easily take it out and shove a diaper in it for quick changes so that I don't have to bring the entire bag in.I got this pod because I hate carrying a diaper bag around.For quick trips to the grocery store, or other brief trips, it is great.I fit the pad, 2-3 size 5 diapers, a travel wipes case, and bottom cream in it.On the outside pocket, I keep a couple plastic diaper disposing baggies and a disposable bib for restaurants.Great product if you have a child who doesn't need change of clothes, or food brought along anymore.After reading all the reviews on this walker I decided to take a chance on it and I'm glad we did.the mirrors still lock in the socket but now our mirrors rotate 360 degrees so my baby can move them to see things.I cant see that it makes the toy any less safe.The only reason I can figure they locked them in a position is that when they rotate, the petals on the outside of the mirror tap the windshield.We love this walker.He can stand up in it at lowest setting (he is 24 inches)and it rolls very smoothly over our wood floors.Just slap a bumper sticker on the back and hes ready to move.Since it has gotten frigid outside I have not been using the Ergo as it is not easy to keep my daughter in the Ergo with her coat on.In general the product works well I do have a problem of the sunshade coming out regardless of how I put it in the pouch.More comfortable than any other carrier or sling I have used.My daughter is approximately 22lbs.Okay, so I am using these bottles for breastfeeding, but with the latex nipples as my little one hates any kind of silicone nipples.The only criticism I have is that I sometimes find it hard to see how many ounces I am pumping directly in to the bottles because of the cutesy design.I like the original Playtex nurser designs better for that purpose.this is a great starter set.they're easy to assemble, never leaky unless the liner is over-filled.liners are expensive, but we found generic store brand liners work just as well (if not better, since they seem to be made of a thicker plastic) than the playtex liners for half the price.overall worth it for not having to constantly clean bottles.i use a microwave steam sterilizer to make sure the nipples, caps & rings are thoroughly clean and either handwash the holders or put them right in the dishwasher.this is sometimes hard to do since the bottles are taller than is reachable with my fingers,  but this is an easy thing to remedy if you just use something longer to do this (like the thick handle on a wooden spoon).If you are going to freeze and use breast milk, you might not use the storage set that Playtex created for them though.While it is really convienent to freeze and use the same liners, sometimes they tear or leak when thawed.he nursing cover does make you feel like you and your baby are protected in a cocoon while nursing.If you're a baby wearing, breastfeeding mother who is also fashionable this is a must in the baby category.The fabric is very breathable so you don't have to worry about baby while nursing.We liked the convenience of the pocket on the cover.It is easy to care for if anything spills on the cover just toss it in the wash.The product was developed, tested and Read more at [...]I love the Snoogle Body Pillow and the cover fits great, but it is not as soft as I could like it to be.I find myself pulling the sheet in between my body and the cover pillow.This product works wonderfully with my Medla Pump in style.We never had any problems with leaks using the drop ins, and we used every size of liner (4oz, 8oz, 10oz).I have this set, and also purchased an extra breast milk storage kit.The lids that came with the extra kit did not fit the Ventaires as well causing some leaks, but the sealing disc that come with this set fit great.I ordered this bottle for my 3month old.Many of the reviewers claimed they didn't have problems with the crystal clears like they did with the regular ones.Since I have been using playtex for a long time I wasn't ready to give up on them just yet and tried this bottle.Both have the same identical pump mechanism and both stop working more often than they should, but my son LOVES them.So when the toy won't turn on, I hear, "Momma, get MY screw driver".So I get my screw driver and this is how I fix it every single time...Sometimes just taking the cover off will magically start it working again.There are 6 screws that require a small phillips head (do not take off the battery compartment screws).I have stripped one of our screws, but it doesn't matter as only the battery compartment needs to be water tight.I found that the pump had seized up a couple times and taking the cover off and sticking the screw driver into the pump fins and spinning it will restart it.This has been my 18 month old son's favorite bath toy since I got it for him about 6 months ago.A great toy, he uses it so much I think it's time to replace the batteries.Organizes the bathtub and allows toddler toys to dry out a bit between uses!Skip Hop is one of my favorite baby brands, so this tub toy organizer was something I had to have.I ordered it and was so excited when it arrived...Only to find that I could not get it to stick on the wall.It took me about an hour total between scrubbing my shower wall (and I am not an unclean person) and pushing the suction cups like crazy trying to get it to stick.We couldn't get this bag to stick at first because there was just a little cleaning powder residue on our shower wall.Once we got the wall uber-clean it sticks fine and holds a fair amount of toys.I had this on my baby registry - it had such good reviews and seems like a good idea - but our tile has a slight bit of texture to it and the suction cups wouldn't stay even for a moment.Also, the product is not great looking due to the neoprene - it's a bit beat-up looking, even when new.Stop looking and just buy it.I promise you'll love it.I am one of those people who tends to research and review most purchases (besides groceries) and I spent an hour--I kid you not--comparing the frog holder, cheaper mesh ones, and a few others.I found this Skip Hop Tubby and am SOOOOO happy we did.Our storage stool is now empty and our boys love emptying their toys from this and cleaning up after their baths; yeah, they enjoy cleaning up.They throw their toys into it, soaking wet, and the organizer is completely dry by the next morning (it's made of the same material as wet suits).It holds up to their roughness (ages 3.5 and 18 months) and the suction cups actually require you to use a little muscle to pull them off; they hold 10 pounds of toys and have yet to slide after 3 months of use.It is machine washable and incredibly sturdy.We also use the hooks on the front for their washcloths and loofahs...an added bonus.The other organizers don't seem to hold as well, can get moldy, and don't have a much space as the Skip Hop Tubby.I hope this helps :)****************************************************************************UPDATE, July 2011: Just thought I'd write a quick update to say that we still LOVE LOVE LOVE this Skip Hop Organizer and it STILL (more than 2 years later) has yet to fall or slide off the bathroom wall!It hasn't faded or worn one bit, despite being much fuller than it was when I originally wrote this review.This is one of the best children's products we've ever purchased, and that's saying A LOT considering I do childcare and have been teaching most of my life.If you need a tub organizer, buy this one and save yourself the time of over-researching like I did.This thing holds so many toys.I love that it is easy to put up on the tub wall, and that the little knobs have 'hooks' so you can hang a loofah or washcloth.The mesh goes all around the bottom and sides, and then there's the mesh circle in the middle so you can see the toys as well as allows water to drain.It's made out of the same material that wet suits are made out of, so it's really sturdy.One of the best things about it is you can throw it in the wash!This product says that it is machine washable, but it doesn't hold up well after washing it a few times.Plus, the neoprene has gotten moldy and smelly, despite the washings.On the plus side, it looks really nice when new, and the suction cups work great on our glass doors.It stays stuck on the wall and does just what it is supposed to.so this won't stick.bummer bc otherwise its very cute and well designed.This thing *might* be worth it if it came with a rechargeable battery so I could pack it in my diaper bag.Then the rubber part of the dispenser fell apart and then it wouldn't close at all unless something was placed on top of it.Still works, but it is just annoying to have to rig it so it stays shut.The first week with our newborn was pretty hectic, but little items like this coming in the mail helped calm things down quite a bit.This item is a lifesaver.Having pre-warmed wipes right next to you on the changing table saves so much time and frustration for everyone.If you fold them in half, you can stack them one on top of each other, and it's very easy to use the oldest first, rotating out as you go.Then, when you need to add more, just add the newly wet cloths to the bottom of the stack.As for the bamboo wipes, ours were already coming apart at the threads before we washed them (straight out of the box), so we don't use those.The "pillows" for the bottom of the warmer are easy to use and we have had no problems with the electrical cord.On the whole I like the warmer...two downsides 1) You MUST use different wipes...the lionheart ones fall apart- I use the thirsties.I have not problem filling it once or twice a day so it works for me...but not for everyone.You don't want the same water hanging out in this thing for a week.I also use the clothes to wipe my daughter's face after feedings.The warmer seems like a ridiculous splurge, but it is fantastic.With wipes solution, diaper wipes are like warm lavendar scented spa towels, and they clean up messes far better than disposables, all chemical free.No diaper rash, ever.I hate this warmer.It cracked on the bottom within the first month (ruining my dresser) and leaks when the duct tape patch I fashioned for it wears out every month or so.(buy flannel ones from another supplier- I use green mountain) Six months in, the light stopped working, and the plug is so heavy it falls out of the wall unless I shove something heavy against it.However being that I am addicted to the wipes, and am reluctant to purchase another warmer only to have it fall apart, I still use this piece of junk.Maybe I'll find another at a yard sale this summer...It is extremely easy to use.It does not smell bad or mildewy (which I was worried about), and it is very easy to clean.The "pillow" that creates/holds the moisture has to be replaced every three months, but you can buy two pillows for about $13, so the cost is not horrible.After the warmer arrived I could change the diaper w/o ANY crying in fact there were smiles.With such a noticeable difference, I highly recommend this product.I'm having a hard time with the pillows that are made for it so I'm experimenting.The inside bottom is water tight so you have flexibility with this product.After 9 mos I still use it, I plan on using it for all the future babies too.So, I hate that it took so long, but they were great to work with.I use my own wipes made of flannel and I can fit about 15+ folded like disposable wipes.I haven't had any problems with how many wipes I've put in there and I cram it full.So, other than the faulty power cord and slow customer service, I have been very happy with this warmer.The seller said it was NEW, but when it arrived it was missing the 4 "included" Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes, the plug was unraveled and had a green marker stain on it, and the warmer itself had dirt marks all over it and in it as if it had been used.I contacted the seller today after seeing if it worked, it does, and am waiting for their response.You may want to contact the seller prior to purchasing if this concerns you at all.I gave the product itself the 4 stars, but marked it down by one start due to the condition the seller sent it to me in.I really like this product.No rashes or anything due to no parfumes or anything in the wipes.My 4 month old enjoys this little blankie, and I do mean little!As she is in the stick-everything-in-the-mouth phase, I feel great that this is made of all organic, soft materials.This is a great classic toy.My mom still has one from when my brother was a baby.I liked the idea of a natural wood toy, but I didn't think about the fact that my daughter would be more impressed with black/white or colors.It is currently being used as a door stop in her room.I don't know if my baby would have enjoyed this toy any less without the colored paint (and I know some moms are really concerned about giving anything painted to their kids for fear of the baby eating potentially dangerous paint chips) and I'm happy to report that this is by far my baby's favorite toy to play with.Excellent developmental toy for infants.My baby will hold onto the string parts, stick one of the wooden nubs in her mouth to help soothe her teething pain, and even shake it around or toss it.The thin string parts of the Skwish are easier to grasp for a baby just learning to grab things on her own.I really liked the toy and got it for my 6 month old baby.She is now almost 8 months and still doesn't care for it.Each time she takes it into her hands she just throws it away again.not interested at all in it.My baby boy loves this toy - he started giggling at it the first time I gave it to him.It seems durable, and I love that it's paint-free, too.I was really hesitant to drill into our wall and install this semi-permanently but am SO glad we did.I like the look (on ours the left portion isn't as dark grey which I like) and how it really disappears from sight.Overall, a very functional productUpdate: We've been using this for 3 years now, opening and closing over and over each day and have had no issues with the installation or the gate itself.The closing mechanism works well and the gate has withstood many children playing with it and hanging on it, yanking it, etc.A very good purchase for us.But the gate has "swing" in the title, and in the description it also says "pressure-mounted."I thought I was getting a gate that would swing while pressure-mounted to the wall.When I received it, I realized it only swings if you use hardware to drill holes in the wall.If you pressure-mount the gate, it works just like any other cheap, plastic gate that you have to step over each time (creating another hazard for your baby; what if you trip over it while carrying him/her?)Also, when I did try to pressure-mount it the green "locking" mechanism didn't work properly.I ended up returning it!This rattle is cute, but I think the ends are too chunky and hard for babies to grasp.Mine could never turn the ladybug until she was already too old for rattles.Not bad, but I have found many better.This toy looked great at the store but when i brought it home and washed it for my young one it turn to crap:(the mirror part turned black and the balls inside lots there color.If you buy this toy wipe it with a cloth do not put under tap to cleanHowever, the first two times he played with this one, he wound up hitting himself in the head and crying.Because the rattle ends are very hard plastic and have parts that jut out, it really hurts when it bumps him in the head.I took it away and haven't let him play with it since.There are lots of other rattles out there that won't leave you with a crying baby.Look for a lightweight one with rounded edges, either made of wood or with rubberized ends.Though it is not "spill proof" it is also not a waterfall either... it has a really soft spout that my 5 mos old "biter" can handle without hurt to him or the cup... the handles curve towards him so he can easily grab the cup & aim it at his mouth, and the cap... let's just say I hauled this around in my open backpack all day & it didn't spill or leak once!!I gave it two star because the straw is a pretty unqiue design and does help babies to learn to use a straw.The combi cup is very cute and baby has no problem using it.I used it to feed my baby water, milk, and juice.All is well initially.It's disgusting.I do not recommend this cup to busy moms.This is the best straw cup with handles out there on the market.It takes some getting used to putting it together, but once you figure it out, it works awesome.First of all I totally agree with Michelle D review who also gave this ball 3 stars.But when i play with it and throw it in the air, she smiles to me, or to the ball, I don't know really.I prefer this toy to 6-7 old baby and above.If they were sewn into place it would of been better.For the same price I'll get the big Oball.My 9 month old grandson has been playing with this toy since he was 5 mos old and sitting in his high chair.It sticks better than any other suction cup toy he has - dampen the bottom of the suction cup with warm water and press firmly on a clean, dry surface.It has lots of turning and spinning options which hold his attention while we get his meals ready and then for a little "quiet play" after he's done so we can clean up!He does eventually get it off but at least it stays on a long time and it's very durable so it survives falls and tosses - I think it has better staying power because the cup is actually larger than the base of the toy!So this is a pretty spectacular toy.. spectacularly stupid that is.. Great theory,but the execution is non-existent.It does not really stick well to any surface, making it just kind of fallen on its side.However this thing never really sticks well enough to anything to work the way you want it to or I suppose the way the manufacturer intended for it to work.I gave it 2 stars simply because for the first 2 seconds it does stand up, it is a lot of fun for my little one... but it always (not almost.. but always!)I would say skip this one.The vent system seems to work great (I've been using this system for 6 months now); no air bubbles going through the nipple and ending up in milk.This design seemed best with least amount of pieces to clean.I've only had one leak and that was my own fault (see my complete review on the mildbank "storage system").FYI, you're never supposed to prop a baby's bottle due to risks of tooth decay and choking.They are easy to clean and work well with breast milk.My baby did not like these bottles.I'm assuming it's because he's just not used to them that's why I gave them a 3.I did actually think that they were harder to clean that the Dr. Browns as well.Well I have had them 1 week and they leak a lot!TO be honest I prop my sons bottles at night or sometimes while he is in the car seat and once he is done he will turn his head and and the bottle just sits there until I grab it.Well I was in hopes these would not drip like the others but they do.SO IMO they are NOT WORTH the money!Since switching to them my son spits up more then what he did with the Avent and the platex drop ins.SO back to the Avent we go :)Nice sling!my little guy is 18lbs and I am 5'1/ 112lbs.I wear the S/M.I put it on upside down the first time and thought it was awkward then figured out how it was suppose to go and definitely decided i liked it!The box says you can wear it 5 ways but there are only 3 pictured so I am not sure what the other two are.Really quick and easy to put on and put baby in and out of.I have only tried the side hold since my little guy is 6 mo and not ready for the back hold.Can't wait to try that though.Definitely rec!Love the fabric, however, the  sling was really hard to use.There was just too much adjusting and fidgeting and in the end it was still not something I enjoyed wearing.I actually ended up buying a Moby Wrap, which was so much more comfortable and versatile compared to this pouch sling.I am a 34 yr old woman with all of my teeth and I was unable to drink from this cup!I actually got a headache when trying to use appropriate suction.I figured out that it requires clenching the spout with your teeth then sucking.That is a skill which I don't want my still breast feeding 8 month old to acquire.I'm still looking for a nonspill cup that doesn't require a multitude of talents to master and is breast feeding friendly.I'm torn with this sippy cup.However, I dread cleaning it.After you take it all apart to clean it, it also takes a little bit of time to assemble it back together.They are nice to stick in the diaper bag.The bottom part is a hard plastic and the straw that goes through the top is rubbery.They are not the easiest to clean.I have left the cup with out the bottom straw.My daughter was not happy when her drink was not coming out of the straw.Oops!It is very hard to get any liquid out of this straw cup.But they both leak.I would not recommend this cup at all.I strongly suggest trying out any straw cup yourself before giving it to your toddler.You would be surprised how poorly baby products are manufactured a lot of times.My 18-month-old only drinks from the Munchkin.Other than the straw the Munchkin does not have soft rubber parts where mold grows, like the Combi does.In fact he gets excited when after Mommy takes a big sip the cup makes a sound (air going through the valve.)I used that trick often to get him to drink water.I haven't encounter the problem of leaking in my Munchkin.IT LEAKS!IT LEAKS!IT LEAKS!!!!!Whenever it is on it's side it leaks and ALL of the contents will pour out!So we play that game a lot, which is not horrible but it isn't what I bought the cup for.It's again not horrible, but when you have a child screaming for juice, one extra step is not what you crave.My 20 month old little boy adores drinking from a straw which leaves me fewer options for sippy cups.LOL He is way too busy and needs his hands available for toys, etc.One of our boys caught on the first day we introduced them; the other took a week to catch on.I was glad to skip regular sippies since straw sippies are supposed to be better for oral and speech development.They are reasonably easy to clean and put together.He can chew the top half of the straw right off before I realize what he's doing.This is the only one my 9 month old can use on her own.I bought this and the Nuby (2 handle flip straw cup).And then, it is a smap to put it back toghether again.But we keep a set of these in the car and one in our carry-on bag for airline travel.These DO NOT LEAK!He also uses the soft sippy spout version of this same maker and that also DOES NOT LEAK!!My toddlers hold the cups quite easily.They clean up easily and reassembly is a snap.We do not leave home without these.I likes these since you don't have to think about which top fits on which cup .they're interchangeable and easy to clean.I don't like the fact that the straws are easy to lose.I wish they had a side holder to clip them on.We were given several different types of sippy cups.This was his favorite one and could really drink from this cup without trying too hard or getting frustrated.But it hasn't broken yet.My daughter does not like sippy cups with a hard spout because they are harder to suck.size with handles, and a larger 10 oz.size without handles (with a spout or a straw).bottle because it is long.The only caveat is that in 6 months, she has managed to rip the hole in two of the silicone spouts.That said, the silicone valve that comes with hard spout cups can also rip.I ordered replacement soft spouts at $1.50 each by simply calling the manufacturer Munchkin.Their online web store has not functioned in a week, and it incorrectly says that the spouts are on back order, so it is better to call their toll-free number.Overall, I am very happy with this product.Other than that, it was a big disappointment for us.We were looking for some new sippy cups for our toddler, and I ordered this one on a whim.It leaks easily when turned over, it doesn't have a lid to cover the spout, the handles are spaced so that my toddler pinched her hands grabbing the bottom of the handles, and it's a pain to get the spout off and back on for cleaning.I would've given it just one star, but I did like the fact that it was BPA-free.I like other Munchkin products, but not this sippy cup.The handles make it easy to pick up.I appreciate having products like this available to nursing moms.I have only had to use this about 10 times in the 4 months since my daughter has been born (mostly because we stay home a lot), but it works well for the job.My friend even borrowed it while we were out and about because she had forgotten hers.It has kind of a stiff upper edge so you can keep it somewhat folded out, which makes it easy to see the baby from the top, but others can't see.I think this is a great product, but could easily be made with some simple sewing.If you want to pay the money instead, though, go with this one!We just recieved our replacemnet hamper from Amazon, and this one seems much more put together than the first one.I guess it was a fluke?the first though literally fell apart every time i took clothes out of it.We shall see over time how long it lasts.i read the bad reviews about this product but still bought it because it was on sale and it looks good on picture.the wooden material is cheap, it won't even stand up.i'm so frustrated i want to burn it.if ic ould rate it zero, i would.it's a waste of money.They are insulated so during the summer months my daughter's water would stay nice and cold while we were outside.I like that the straw has some resistence - you really have to suck to get the drink out - it took my daughter about a week to figure it out (but we started using them when she was 10 months old) - once she got the hang of it, it was no problem.I did email Playtex customer service and they got back to me quickly and sent me a coupon for a free cup, so I think it is a great company and will continue to purchase their products.It will be standing straight up on the counter and milk will start coming out of the straw.We can't figure out what the problem is or how to fix it.My twin boys are breast fed so perhaps thats why they don't have a problem with the required amount of suction?Well, one of my twins can empty it without a pause too, so don't think its even an issue.The other boy not so much, but he is in general more interested in nursing and less into being weaned so that may be the issue.he's not too interested in juice, kefir, etc either.Pros -- looks cute, insulated, super easy to assemble even tho they have lots of parts.much easier than the munchkin since there is no curve topush the silicone part of the straw thro the lid that you have to jiggle etc anymore.Mostly works as leakproof if I take the trouble to click.Cons -- Did have the strange issue where milk seeped up and out of the cup once, lids are not interchangable with the very similar non-insulated versions even though they fit, they leak, so you have to be careful to match the cups with lids back up out of the dishwasher.We have two kids - one who's almost 4 and uses the CamelBak bottles, and an 11-month old who went straight to straws.Problem with straw cups is they leak.I can throw one in my purse and not worry about water or juice getting all over.I think if someone had a problem with leaking, it was just a defective cup and they should exchange it.I have two and love these.Update: Still love the cups, but I discovered that if you close the lid too tight the liquid DOES come out the top of the straw.(Not a problem for me, but my husband always closes things too tightly!)They've done pretty well with them but they're slightly hard to drink from and they randomly leak sometimes.We got a pack of these Playtex twist and click straw cups to try and we all like them so much better!They're very easy to drink from and clean; the boys love them!We've had no problems so far; they seem to be the perfect straw sippy!(By the way, they say age 2+ but so far neither of our 14-month-olds have had a problem with them.They're definitely a little harder for them to hold than the Munchkin cups but they got used to these pretty quickly.)UPDATE 14 months later: I have mixed feelings about these cups.They probably just need to be replaced more often, but after a while we started to have a lot more leaking problems.I just ordered two more and I think it's ridiculous that the ad just says "Colors May Vary" and doesn't allow you to indicate a preference.This cup is terrible.It leaks and it's more difficult to drink out of.I purchased these cups because the old one is no longer being sold, nor is the replacement straws for the old cup.I was extremely disappointed with this cup.I am now in search of a different brand insulated straw cup that I can be confident won't leak all over my diaper bag and car and house... and everything else.The younger one still tilts the cup up like a bottle sometimes, but that is a user issue.What I love about these are the built in valve in the straw that keeps the contents from leaking EVEN IF straw is open.And they fit in standard carseat cupholders!!I think these are rather pricey for what you get.As far as adding width to the stroller, it adds about 4 inches more on each side to the wheelbase.Hasn't been too much of an issue so far...Are the panniers necessary?However, with the sometimes annoying small cargo pod on the bottom that remains closed (it does have it's pros and cons) unlike the open mouth baskets of other strollers, you will find that purchasing the panniers may be a convenient add-on when going to the park/beach or your nearby grocery/convenience store.PROS:- Two baskets to hold grocery sized bags that takes the place of a wide basket found underneath other strollers- Tool-less snap on and off installation- folds flat for easy storage- Durable ballistic nylon materialCONS:- Gets in the way of docking the infant car seat- Expensive accessory that could have been included with the stroller to make up for the small bottom cargo pod- Creates a visually wide stance that may be annoying in a crowded area- MUST install two baskets to ensure equal weight distribution for safe handling of the strollerThe good news is that it isn't cumbersome to install.Which means it doesn't have to stay put forever.Install as needed and tuck away when expecting to be around crowded areas.Glad to see it didn't just happen to me, I thought maybe I had done something wrong.When I purchased the wipe warmer they gave me a few of these free, I'm glad they did because I was curious.I had to sew a finishing edge on the one side to keep it from unraveling further.They are small which might not be a problem in the beginning but then when you have bigger "jobs" to clean up, you'll end up using 2 or 3.I'm not a large person, 5'9" and after I washed these, I could fit one of them in my hand.I wouldn't recommend buying this, I found the Thirsties to be better, they're what I reach for if it's not just pee in her diaper.Received these along with the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer at my baby shower and thought they were both totally unecessary...but kept them since it was a well-meant gift.Now I think of these as indispensible!Gets the baby cleaner than disposable wipes, with no chemicals and no waste.As stated in other reviews, the bamboo material is somewhat delicate and may fray at the edges- IF you don't care for them.But care is simple!When I get 5 or so wipes soiled, I toss the whole bag in the washer with other baby clothes or cloth diapers.You don't need to dry them (they're WET wipes!)We do also use other, thinner cotton wipes (available on Amazon also), generally for pee-only diaper changes.But these thicker bamboo ones are fabulous for cleaning up poopy messes!My favorite part is that I mix a few drops of tea tree oil, lavender oil, olive oil and organic baby soap in 2 cups of water and pour this mix over the wipes before putting them in the warmer.LOVE this product!----UPDATE: my baby is now 8 months old and we're still using the same wipes, which get washed in hot water every few days, and I'm now too lazy to mess with the lingerie bag ;) They just go in the wash with the diapers and that's that.Oh, sometimes they go through the dryer too.Am back today to order more since we never use disposable wipes any more.Really easy to pull this off because if you inflate it too much before putting it on the tap you won't get it on.Baby pulls it off so makes it pointless.I didnt want something that my baby would want to grab at, I thought this would be pretty plain and work and it does.soft.cheap.exactly what I expected.has a perforated area in case you have one of things that lift up on top of your faucet.My daughter first played around with it as a toy and it does protect her from bumping her head in the tub.We've had this toy for six months, and we use it at least a few days a week for bath time.I haven't even replaced the batteries yet, and we use it pretty often.It's great how it acts like a faucet with the water running out, but you're not wasting it because it's just sucking up the water already in the bath.She always points to it and asks us to put it in the bath.Just make sure the battery compartment is sealed and on tight when you put the batteries in, you don't want water getting in there.Of course, you also have to make sure the pump at the bottom is always submerged in water, or it can burn out the motor.I recommend this toy for fun at bath time!and "momma fix it!"I couldn't find any warrantee info.Sometimes just taking the cover off the inlet will magically start it working again.I found that the pump had seized up a couple times and taking the cover off and sticking the screw driver into the pump fins and spinning it will restart it.It's definately her new favorite.Plays with it almost her whole bath time every day.Any baby who likes running bath water...which most do I think, would love this.Not a "cheap" bath toy, but well worth it.We've never had a bath toy that held the kids attention for this long.A definite "must have" toy!UPDATE: It was a hit until it got water in the battery compartment and died after two months of use.One lasted three weeks and the other about four months and then they both died.Yep...water in the battery compartment.It's fun while it lasts but don't expect longevity cause it has a major design flaw.I purchased this toy for my 2-year old son a few weeks ago.My kids love this bath toy.They enjoy learning how to switch it on and off by pushing the mask.This is the best bath toy ever!My 3 year old loves it.I love it because it keeps him happy and it saves me on the water bill.Buy it!We have many bath toys, and this is the best one so far.Now, the water doesn't have to be running in the tub for the whole bath.This is such a cute product.I recommend it!UPDATE:  The motor broke, returning to Amazon for refund.Total bummer.We were struggling to find a way for my 21-month old son to stop trying to turn on the "hot" knob in the bathtub.This little toy has done the trick.Every time my daughter has a bath she plays with this toy.Its easy for her to turn on and off and sticks very well to the tub.3 months later and about 5-10 uses the thing will not turn on at all.Tried new batteries and all.I took the whole thing apart too.its like the motor is shot.too bad i wasted my money on this this was an original and fun toy while it lasted.I also bought some squirter toys and a little boat, etc., but I bought the Flow N Fill because of the high reviews and because the baby was fascinated by the water coming out of the tub faucet.I used to turn the faucet on and she loved putting her hands underneath it, but I decided that was wasting a bunch of water!She's 14 months old now and still loves this thing.I wouldn't have to put any other bath toys in the tub with her--she'd be content to just play with the Flow N Fill.One of the best feautures of this toy are the suction cups.I swear, I haven't had to re-attach the toy since I first put in on the tub.And since little ones LOVE to try to pull things down, she yanks on this toy every night, it still stays put.As she's gotten older, she's learned to not only enjoy the simple stream of water that comes out, but now, she's learned to play with the little stackable cups and has learned how by stacking them different ways and putting them under the flow of water, it produces different results.I'm seriously buying this for every baby I know for their 1 year birthday.I will write back if it breaks like the other reviewers say...but so far so good!My only small down fall is that it needs batteries.Surly there is a way to create a toy like this that does not require any batteries.The first time my boys uses this in the tub they were in the bath tub for over an hour playing.Every time they take baths now they are in there for a long time and love playing with this.Would recommend to anyone with kids especially if bath time is not a fun even of the day normally.My kid loves this toy so much, that it's nearly impossible now to pry him out of the bath before his toes are all wrinkly.I actually hide it when it isn't bath time.If he sees it, he wants very badly for it to *be* bath time... right this second!Worth every penny; I have never gotten as big a bang for my toy buck before or since.Edited to add:  well, it eventually stopped working, but my husband, who is much handier than I am, took it all apart and cleaned out the filter on the inside.Presto!My daughter loves this toy.We use rechargeable batteries to help but expect to change the batteries on this bad boy at least twice a month if your child plays with it as frequently as ours does.My son loves this toy, he will play wih it for as long as we let him.I will update in a few months on durability.Revision, this toy only lasted as long as the first set of batteries.When the batteries died I put a new set in  and it never turned back on.It was a recommendation from Amazon and after reading the reviews I knew I had to have it.A great purchase - planning on buying these for gifts in the future!This solves the problem of her always wanting the faucet running.Such a neat toy!She and her 3 year old brother spend the entire bath playing with it.Her attention span is usually pretty short but not with this toy.I plan to buy it for friends when their children turn 1.I was so excited to find this so I didn't have to run the water constantly.The motor must've gotten wet one too many times (impossible not to) and it's completely dead now.Big disappointment because my son loved this while it lasted.My daughter loved this toy... getting her out of the bathtub was difficult because she wanted to keep playing with it.It even distracted her enough to let me wash her hair, which is usually a big ordeal in our house.Unfortunately, it lasted for three baths and then stopped working.It was not handled roughly.We were careful to not leave the motor running but it still just quit.New batteries did not fix it.It was a waste of money and I recommend NOT purchasing this item unless you are comfortable spending around 20 bucks for a toy that will work 3 times.Note that although the product description states that it does not need batteries, it does.He loves the water pouring out and putting his hands in the water, he likes to play with the cups and fill them with water.A great toy.It does not come with batteries, I believe it took 2 or 3 double A batteries.Would highly recommend this toy for a a baby 6 months to 9 months.Well made.Like 2 hours straight!There was so many things we could do with the toys, we took them out, put them back in, we hid each under our shirts or under hats, we put the bag on her head, rolled the toys in our laps/down the aisle - it was endless.Sadly we lost the banana and orange and only came back with the milk, lettuce, bag and apple.:( I almost want to buy a new set to get all the toys back.She loves this toy and I love it!I can't tell you how long I waited to be able to buy this for my daughter.When I first was looking for something like this she was too little (about 4 months) for most baby toys.But she's always been a grasper and wants to check out everything's texture and taste in particular.This one lets them hold the bag while she shops or pretends to eat and lets them have "a bite".The milk carton has a little mirror when the top part is opened (velcro again) but isn't a big interest yet.With the slippery texture though this is a favorite for chewing since we're going through teething right now.I cannot praise this toy enough.If you're health concious the fact that these are fruits, a veggie and milk may also be appealing over other food toy sets.Perfect for children from about 10-12 months (I think the recommendation is 12 months but IMO my baby would have been okay at 10) through the toddler years.She will load and unload the little bag over and over again for almost 20 mintues.It helped her learn the word apple and well as nana (banana).Since she started playing with this, she also started to peel her own real banana if I let her.She has enjoyed the Kringelring for awhile and I was going to order her some more Haba toys, and then we happened to find a shelf of them in a baby store and this is the one she picked out--I was going to get her the pipapo and a couple of others but she found this one way more interesting.It is really cute.She likes the bell, and the face in the blue car moves back and forth a little.It'a a very fun toy and I love that it's totally nontoxic.I have never used one before and I am glad that I started with this one.The wipe does cool off quickly once it is removed but that will happen with any warmer you get.The pad inside of it stays very wet for about 9 days and then I have to re wet it.The discoloration easily cleans off though under hot water.This is worth the money & can also be found at most walmartsOverall a great product!We have a very small car, and after going to the baby stores and trying out all the seats, this is the only convertible seat that really fit rear facing.I returned this car seat shortly after we purchased it.It was difficult to align the seat belt buckles together before latching in and I crushed my baby's finger!I bought it when I was expecting baby #3 and needed to fit a third car seat across the back of my 2008 subaru forrester.The padding for newborns is really substantial and I would imagine very comfy.We  purchased a 2010 santa fe and  switched the seats over it  fits the 3 car seats across the back easily.The American Academy of Pediatrics (and studies of crash injuries) recommends that infants and toddlers should ride rear-facing for as long as possible to the maximum weight and height limit of rear-facing car seats.To that end, we searched hard for a high weight- and height-limit convertible car seat that would fit in both our Honda Accord and our Toyota Prius without having to push the front seats forward.The seat and fabric are well-designed, and in both of our cars, we have full range of motion for the front seats.This means, however, that in rear-facing mode, the baby's legs are bent at the knees when sitting in the car seat.But with a weight limit of 33 pounds and a height limit of 40 inches in rear-facing mode, it's usually a better bet that a child can survive a crash with broken legs while facing the rear, versus a broken neck when facing forward too soon.Here are the specs of the car seat (any color):Dimensions: 17 in (l) x 14.65 in (w) x 28.25 in (h)Product Weight: 11.75 lbRear-facing weight capacity: 5-33 lbForward-facing weight capacity: 1 year and 20-40 lbHeight allowance: 40 inWe use the seat belt and foam pool noodle method to secure the seat in rear-facing mode for our toddler.My daughter seems to really like this.The monkey is very soft and cute.How much more could one ask for from a towel?the design is nice...but the material is just like any other thin, soft towel; the hood is not very useful unless you want to take the baby out of the bathroom with wet hair.Really thin.I would not recommend.Maybe good for newborns because they are soft and small.I like the designs, very cute and they coordinate well with the rest of the nursery.However, I thought these would be softer.For the price, I guess I was expecting too much.The mug is ideal in that the top SCREWS onto the mug itself rather than just snapping on like most other snack mugs.I could chuck this thing across the room and hit a wall with it and it wouldn't spill!He's got small hands so it's not like he can grab a heck of a lot of them at one time anyhow.This is one of those "why didn't I think of it" ideas.Let me preface this with the fact that I have been a mom for 16 years.I have been taking snacks on the go and just dealing with the mess for a long time.I stumbled on the munchie mug on amazon.I balked at the price then thought, if it really works, it's worth it!I got ours in the mail yesterday and immediately washed it and filled it with Chex.Handed it to my toddler and sent him off.I was amazed that it was super easy for him to get his hand in and out and he didn't spill ANY of his snack!!Later in the day, I brought it with us in the car and let him have some snack.No spills!It takes up a lot of space in the diaper bag.It's easy to use, can't be accidentally opened, prevents spills, and allows for a little independence for your little one.I try to keep snacks at the table, but sometimes I will let my 16 month old have a little plastic bowl with some crackers or dry cereal in it.Even though it is convenient for the moment, I know that every time a huge crumbly mess will follow.So I started looking around for some other options, especially something that could be taken in the car as well, and I am so glad that I got this.It is very lightweight, super easy to clean, the fabric is completely water-resistant, so you can quickly rinse the whole thing and pat the fabric dry with a towel and it is completely dry and ready to use again immediately.The fabric overlaps *perfectly* and is just tight enough to stop any spills, but allows more than enough room for a little hand to reach in.Seriously, my daughter is so in love with this thing and I have been watching it closely to see if anything spills or how it really works, and it really does not spill or allow for any mess.I am putting this on my list to buy new Mom's or Mom's of toddlers!A bit pricey, yes, but in the long run it will save you money!I love how it comes with a plastic cover to keep your snacks fresh while not in use.The handle on the lid makes it super easy for my son to hold.I wish they made it in a smaller version for shorter outings.It was surprisingly easy for my 12-month-old to learn how to put his hand in and out of his "contraption".I love the fact that it hardly spills a thing.It rarely happens.With other cups like this, he gets his food everywhere (inside the car, all over his clothes, and all over his car seat, making a royal mess).This cup definitely cuts down on the mess.I'm considering buying another one to keep in our other car.Very handy to have around.It would make a great gift idea too!Everywhere I go people ask me where I got it from and talk about how neat it is.I have a 15 month old,and bought the munchie mug based on the rave reviews of a friend, and the amazon reviews.Not a deal breaker but it doesn't conveniently pop into a diaper bag or stroller caddy.2) It isn't remotely airtight.It doesn't claim to be, but there is simply no way to seal it off, apart from putting the whole thing in a large ziplog.While it's good for filling and immediately eating out of, I can't fill it and leave it in a bag until needed, or I get a handful of stale cheerios (I live in a humid area).Ultimately, this is why I had to shelf the munchie mug.You pretty much need to fill and feed immediately, storing food for more than a few hours in this is out of the question.So I went out and bought aMade For Mom Snack Trap, 2 Pack, Gender Neutralwith a lid.Pros: small, lightweight.You can purchase a lid (and I recommend you do-it doesn't always  come with one.)Easy for kids to carry, and fits well in a diaper bag.This one gets daily use in my house, as we can keep it filled with goldfish or cereal at all times.Cons: kind of flimsy, and the munchie mug's fabric top DOES do a better job of keeping things in.Overall,for this type of product, I'm throwing my vote to the snack trap, despite not being PERFECT.What a great test drive of containers!So I was confirmed by a lot of the reviews of the above drawbacks and stumbled upon this one.It's looked a bit big, but the reviews were great and the description seem to address most of my concerns.And it did!The container is big enough to hold LOTS of snacks... crackers, Cheerios, etc.The top screws on so it doesn't ever come off, by accident or intentionally by a toddler.The part that little hands push through is super soft and it acts almost like a lid sealing the snacks and preventing them from going stale.The top also has a handle so he holds onto it when he wants to take the container around.Yes, it is pricey, but after a few weeks of running around picking up things that fell out of the other cups...it has paid for itself and saved your sanity.When it gets dirty, just toss it in the dishwasher and like new again!It took my 14 month old a whole 10 seconds to figure out how to work it and now loves to carry it around even if it is empty.I threw them all away.We have a two-year-old and a 7-month-old, and we feel confident that both children will not be able to hurt themselves on the gas stove.My older child can reach around it to turn on the oven light, but he can't reach the knobs or the burners.I read the reviews for those little plastic knob covers, but a lot of people complained about them breaking or actually encouraging curiosity in children.I don't think they're very attractive, either.Some have even asked if we made it ourselves.Admittedly, it does get in the way of the drawers on each side of the stove, but I just lift it a little and it's not a huge deal.If you know you are going to open the door to the floor, you can simply hold the shield on to ensure that it does not fall off.3.Unnecessary Clips: The shield comes with some clear plastic clips to be installed on the front of your oven door.I found these clips to be completely useless and devoid of function.I would recommend not installing them at all.There are few things as dangerous as stovetops.This is an excellent product, and I would recommend it to anybody.I ordered this because I was very happy with the crib sheets in the same line.Those were a nice thick cotton that feels fairly soft to the touch.This changing table cover is a thin, rough terrycloth.I'm glad I only ordered the one.On a positive note, the blue does match the sheets exactly, if you're going for a certain look, and it IS nice to find organic fabrics that come in something other than white and off-white.It matches great in our neutral room and it fits our generic changing pad pretty good.I use a Kushies diaper on top so I don't have to take off/wash as often.I love the crib sheets that are part of this product lineSummer Infant Naturally Yours  Crib Sheet - Mineralbut these changing pad covers are not terribly exciting.Compared to that, this is thin terry cotton and the safer dyes that sometimes look a little washed out don't look great on the terry.It may look better once washed.This cover was also way too big - it may have fit if I washed it, dried it in the dryer, and shrunk it, but it looked quite a bit too big when I put it on.Obviously not really a safety issue, but it looked kinda ghetto.If you are trying to match the sheets, these may work once washed and dried, but I returned mine before washing because it just didn't look so hot.It is nice to be able to buy organic products, but these are very thin (I ordered two different ones in two different colors).So, one gives up the plushness of other (non-organic) covers to have the absorbency of terry, yet the terry is so thin that it is not very absorbent.Not bad, but not great either.I read so many reviews and watched video reviews on almost every single high chair available and concluded that I really wanted to get this high chair.I am NOT disappointed at all!My baby is only 3 months old and I just recently put him in it to feed him his bottle and also just to sit when I'm doing dishes or cooking.There are so many things I love about this chair!LOVE:-The material of the chair is easy to clean and wipe up.-The 9 adjustable heights is so convenient for when I want to pull my baby close to us sitting at the high dinner table, or when I'm sitting lower on the couch.-The swing is such a nice feature for when my baby is about to fall asleep.-It stores away very compactly- much smaller than other high chairs- so it's nice when we have company over and want to put things away.-The sticky tray is perfectly "sticky" so my baby won't be able to pull it off.-The 5 point harness keeps my baby safely strapped in.-So many adjustable settings (besides the height, is being able to recline the chair!- LOVE that!It did take us awhile to figure out all the levers and buttons to work the high chair.But once you get the hang of it, it honestly is a GREAT high chair.Luckily, he was strapped in!!!!)We've used it with our baby and other toddlers that come over to visit, so we know it'll be great for our baby when he gets older too.I would definitely buy it myself if we didn't get it as a gift.If you have the money, then splurge.I wanted to purchase the accessories that went with this chair, but it seemed kind of expensive for what you get, so I ordered the Tiny Love Sunny Stroll Arch from Amazon to attach to it, so that my baby can play with it while sitting in the chair.Maybe I'll update later when I receive it and see how it goes with the Tatamia!We love this high chair.can be used from birth and up as it can be a swing.definitely worth the money.everyone always comments on itI live in small military house and anything to help save room I am into!I have no problem with the tray being too far away from my son.It cleans easily and is very user friendly.I just have so many great things to say about this high chair.After much research, I purchased peg perego si from another website.I know all the good things about the si from other reviewers.It's probably OK if your only drink from very skinny water bottles.2)The recline mechanism is not good.It required 2 hands, and sometimes 3 hands when it gets stuck.The mechanism is different from the peg perego piliko P3, which is one hand recline.I don't understand why peg perego did not use the same mechanism on the si.3)the bumper bar requires tool to remove, I think.It's good and bad.But bad because it's inconvenient.4)can't add child tray.I hope peg perego gives the option to add child tray.Maybe next year's design?5)storage is large but may drag on floor if heavy stuff is put in.Storage basket is not supported so it's only good for clothing, jackets, etc...Other than that, the stroller is excellent.It steers well, folds compact, stands alone when folded, excellent canopy, nice and thick fabric, stable, has stroller hooks(so diaper bag won't slide down), full seat recline, has adjustable footrest, and is super cute!I am not sure if I'll keep this stroller.It depends on if I can get over with the above-mentioned issues.Hope peg perego will make those improvements soon!After much research, I decided upon the Si because it was lightweight with a big sun canopy and had an extended foot rest with a full reclining seat.For the most part I like this stroller because my Son Is able to take long naps in it when we are sight seeing or at amusement parks.It is very easy to steer, fold and unfold.the harness secures my son really well and the canopy can pull forward pretty far, shielding him from the sun on hot days.I also like that there is a cup holder provided and that the handle height is adjustable.The only things that I did not like are that the stroller when folded is not as compact as I thought, it is also a bit heavier that my Maclaren Quest.The cup holder could also use improvement as it cannot hold a four ounce baby bottle securely.The under cargo basket could also use improvement because it sometimes drags on the ground if too many items are placed in the basket.It was a little on the pricier end though and very similar to the Chicco Light Way which is almost $100.00 cheaper.I also have the Chicco Light Way which I had won in a raffle after I had purchased the Si and had I known of the light way any sooner, I probably would have saved the $100 and stuck with the Light Way instead as it virtually has a lot of the same features, with a more secure cup holder and also reclines as far as the Si.With no tax and free shipping, it was a great deal.I had ordered it from another website for $20 cheaper, but the stroller was on back order for 12 weeks!All in all, a great purchase - and trusted since I went through Amazon.We've had it a week now, and took it on vacation already.This would be the BEST stroller, if not for just a couple big problems.Pros:-Folds very compactly (about 6 inches shorter and wider than the Trevi), has a great standing fold.-Great color, looks great.-Very comfy seat, good harness.-Big basket under the seat (doesn't drag, even when loaded).-Big sunshade.-Extendable handles are comfortable to hold.- Very tall back for a big baby.-Slim enough to go down aisles in stores, and between tables in restaurants.-Can hold a heavy diaper bag without tipping, and has hooks on the handles to hold it.Cons:-Cup holder falls off all the time, can't actually fit a cup.-The front legs have to latch into plastic sockets when you unfold the stroller.The manual makes it sound like this should happen automatically when you unfold it, or that you can push the seat down and they'll click in.Mine don't line up with the sockets though, so I have to bend down and put each one in manually.This is a BIG issue, however, I chose to keep the stroller instead of sending it back because....Overall, this stroller has a lot of great features and if not for the annoying wheel shaking, and the time it takes to unfold and assemble the legs, it would be the perfect stroller.It has enough of the features I wanted that I decided to keep it, since all of the umbrella strollers I tried out at the store seemed to be made more cheaply.This is not at all a good outdoor stroller, in fact, I've kept our big travel system stroller for going on walks, because the Si shakes horribly when used outdoors.However, it does a fine job indoors, for running errands.This is a lot of money to pay for a stroller that can't be used outdoors, so if that's what you're looking for, I recommend you keep looking.UPDATE JUNE 2011:After using this stroller for several months, I've decided to add one star to my earlier review.Although the wheels still shake on walks outside, it happens less often now (only when trying to go at a faster pace) and this has become my preferred stroller for most outings.Overall, I'd buy it again and recommend it as a great stroller for indoors and walking around the neighborhood.I have been using this stroller for about 5 months now and can't wait to get rid of it.I was looking for a lightweight stroller that I can take everywhere I go with me and decided to go with this one after reading many reviews.First the pros:Lightweight - yes, this stroller is lightweight and folds together oknice canopy - I love the canopy, I can adjust it different ways so my baby is shaded by the sun anytime of the day when the sunlight comes in in different anglesharness - this stroller has a nice 5 point harness , great for a wiggly babybreathable fabric - baby doesn't sweat in itCons:- stability - I understand this is a lightweight stroller, but this one is terrible on the road )flimsy), the front swivel wheels rattle and shake constantly and make it difficult to push and drive smoothly on normal pavementin order to make the stroller drive properly I have to lock the wheels so they only go straight, which is a pain- the handles rattle as well and feel as if they will fall apart any minute- the basket on the bottom is a joke, even a light blanket will drag in itthe wheels are my main complain and are the reason why I want to get a new stroller.It's really difficult to use this wayIt seems a little big (sticks out from the wall 3 inches), but the good thing is it fits a big 3-prong extension cord plug.Great product.Also, these had 2 tiny holes on the bottom for the cord so my multi-outlet strip cord would not fit through - very frustating!I had to return most of them.The Kidco guys thought all this through and solved both problems!!!Great product!I really like this product.I usually get 1/2 oz or less per feeding.A little more in the morning, and less progressively as the day goes on."There are a few things I dislike, however.I only use it at home when I am nursing.When I am out, I just use the nursing pads and don't cry over leaked milk.*It takes some time to deal with the milk, cleanup, etc.Not a LOT of time, but you have to have a bottle or container of some sort (you can't mix warm milk with cold) to store your milk in, and then you have to pour it out of the Milk-Saver into the bottle, which is slightly awkward, and wash the milk-saver for the next use.Then at some point, you have to combine your collected milk to freeze (1/2 oz doesn't go very far.)And, I am not adept enough to do most of this one-handed.So sometimes I have spilled on myself just getting out of the chair.Take it out, set it in its stand, and then feel free to move around.*It does seem just a tad overpriced.Overall, I wish I had bought this product earlier.I would recommend it to breastfeeding friends.I used it for the first time today and saved 1 ounce from dripping while I nursed on the other breast!It is a little bulky.I think the design could have been smaller but it gets the job done.I was skeptical, but this product works just like it says it should.I am usually able to collect around an ounce of extra milk when I feed my baby in the morning just by slipping it in place.Much easier than pumping, although I have to do plenty of that too.I find it an easy way to collect a little extra milk for very little effort and time...much appreciated these days with a newborn in the house.This milk saver is great in regards to it's ability to collect what you're leaking.I collect 1.5-2oz with every feeding so I am able to store up a good supply without pumping.The only negative things I can say is that it's not discreet,you cannot hide this device.Also it comes with this plastic piece thats supposed to help collect milk right into a storage bag but it doesn't hold the bag on t all...useless.The teether is actually very soft & pliable.I was thinking it might be hard after I hit the checkout button, but I was wrong.There is nothing wrong with this teether, other than the bulb is a little too big for my little man's mouth.It is definitely better for an older child 6+ moths.These are my daughter's favorite teethers!We keep them in the freezer, and even though they don't stay cold for too long, she really seems to enjoy gnawing on them.She didn't really take to any other teether we offered, but she gets all excited when we take these out of the freezer.The only con I can think of (and it's very small), is that that the type of rubber they are seems to attract dirt and hair.Almost like it's sticky (even though it's not).And they're super cute, I get compliments everywhere I go!These teethers were a lifesaver.Now he is older and loves to hold them by the handle and drag it in and out of his mouth letting the bumps massage his gums (it makes an adorable squeak squeak squeak sound from the rubbing).I cannot recommend these enough.I love this sleeping sack by Aden and Anais.Their products are very well made.The material is very soft and will become even more so after being washed.The zipper zips from the top down and won't bother baby's precious skin at all, very handy!Can't wait until my little girl is able to use thisNot only is this product beautiful and soft, but it has saved us this summer.The baby can't sleep without a bag since we started dressing her in them from the start.However, it's too hot for most bags, even plain cotton ones.These aden + anais muslin bags are perfect - they are transparent and allow air to pass through them.Our boy is 4mos, 15,5lbs, 26,5in and he wears a size M for sleeping.If you can get them on sale, go for it.It is the exact same fabric as theiy swaddle blankets and those hold up really well too.One ripped right along the zipper and the other where the muslin is a little thinner.Honestly, I still like the 4 layer one as it is sturdier but this flimsy little thing does not hold up for a baby who sits and rolls around in his/her crib.They are overpriced for the quality they deliver.Like I said, they seem fine at first, but it is really easy for a toddler to rip it and at that price level this simply should not happen.I was not sure if I was going to like this bag at first as it is flimsy.While putting this sleep sack on for the first time I poked a hole in it with my finger!I was trying to put the other arm in and it tore!!However, after just two or three uses and two washes, I found a giant hole in the bottom where the fabric had pulled apart at the seam.The muslin itself pulled apart -- not the seam -- so it's hard to fix with a sewing machine.At the time I used this, my baby was almost seven months old but not yet rolling around a lot when she was in the crib, so she didn't subject the bag to any abnormal wear and tear.The four layer version might be sturdier, but also heavier for the summer.Unfortunately, though, the single layer of muslin doesn't stand up to any use.Even after reading all the reviews with most of them complaining that the seat was too high for the average baby, i decided to get it anyways.Some reviews said it fit their baby fine, most said it was too high even on the lowest setting.This one leaves their little feet hanging a good three inches off the ground!Now instead of going through the trouble of returning it, we just prop a pillow underneath and hope one day they will actually be able to touch the floor, hopefully before they start walking.I have a walker by Chicco that works great for my 9 month old.I needed a 2nd for me to have at work...I DID read other's reviews that it was too tall, but they were talking about younger babies, and I thought for sure it would be short enough for a NINE month old.WRONG!!I don't know who this is designed for, by time he could touch the ground in it, he'll be walking on his own.Don't buy this one unless you have an unusually tall baby.My average sized 10 month old could not even touch the ground on the shortest of the settings.And from reading the reviews on a couple websites this seems to be a common problem.Save yourself the hassle and disappointment, go with another brand.My little guy is now 11 months old and is now out of his walker and walking on his own.He used this walker from age 5 months until now.We had no problem with the height and he is of average height.Never once did safety enter my mind with this walker.Reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that my 7 1/2 month old baby girl only likes it, doesn't love it.But that could change as she gets a little older.WOW is all I can say!After reading the raving reviews for this carrier I ordered it...so glad I did!Now that my grandson is 23 lbs, nearly 11 mos, this carrier is the perfect "next step" from my Peanut Shell Sling (which I love and still use for rocking him to sleep at times)!We use this for walks as well as shopping (when not using a cart cover or stroller) and it is so comfortable besides being quick and easy to adjust the fit for small adult to large so everyone can use!I can't say enough good things about this carrier...attractive besides!I was looking for a side hip carrier that was comfortable and attractive.I am constantly rearranging myself or trying to straighten out the waist band and shoulder cushion from riding up in order to be comfortable.I am so disappointed with this carrier.After reading the rave reviews, I couldn't wait to get this.I hated it more and more with each time I wore it.I think it might be related to the fact that I am very thin and petite and it just didn't fit my frame properly.My poor 7 mo daughter was slipping down my body and I had to keep an arm under her to keep her up.And the pain around my waist was downright unbearable.It also pulled down the waistband of all of my pants and made it is so that my pants were literally falling off of me.It's a great concept and very nicely made, the Picadilly Circus print is super cute.Carriers are a huge investment and there's always those one or two reviews which says the carrier doesn't fit the person.I'm a new mom and was a little overwhelmed with all the choices and I didn't want to spend 100-150 each time to try a new carrier.I found a store that will let you rent carriers before you purchase so that you can make the best decision.[...]- baby carrier rentals.You can rent the scootababy (or beco, or ergo, or babyhawk) and try it out first.Scootababy works great for children that are a little older.We started using this carrier when our daughter was 10 months old (she is small from her age so my guess is most could start using this even earlier).This is a great carrier and definitely worth the price!My son absolutely could not stay asleep unless swaddled, for his first 4 months.I don't leave home without it in the diaper bag!save your money and buy the medela pump in style.the motor works fine and i can get a lot of milk pumped out with this pump.but beware of jagged edges on the breast flanges or loose pieces of plastic.the last thing you want is for plastic to get into your breastmilk.since i couldn't return the item, i asked lansinoh directly for new materials for the breast pump.but still didn't like the new parts and ended buying the medela pump in style advance which is great.I bought this pump so I could breastfeed my third child.This was my third child but first attempt at breastfeeding.I found the pump super easy to use, very easy to clean and am so happy it is such a sanitary pump and does not allow any breastmilk into the pump itself.I was worried I would not succeed at breastfeeding so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a pump and was able to purchase it with coupons and discounts for under $100.I would recommend this pump to every Mom who is budget minded.The pump was very quiet, effective emptying the breasts in less than 20 minutes and the pump itself attaches easily to any standard size bottle.I currently use "Snappies" from Enfamil to store my breast milk and it is working out great.We will be using this pump when I go back to work so I can continue to breastfeed while returning to work full time.This pump was a good buy.I used it continually (And I mean CONTINUALLY) for several months (I had complications with breast feeding and so I pumped ONLY and breast fed my daughter from a bottle, so this pump was used and abused).I bought this one to replace another pump that I had used and abused literally to its breaking point; the motor gave out and it lost some of its suction as a result.The measurements on the bottles of this pump came off in one wash which made calculating the amount of milk difficult, especially for freezing/refrigerating, as the milk storage bags do not have exact measurements.Comfortable flanges and suction, adequate suction (no pump can mimic your baby's suction perfectly, so not all milk will be extracted, but did a satisfactory job).I would recommend a double pump bra for hands-free pumping as this makes EVERYTHING so much easier and less of a hassle.You may lose some suction power if the bra is not the right fit, so be cautious when shopping.All in all this was a good buy and I would recommend it to a friend.i think this pump is great.i didn't want to spend $300 on the medela pumps because i'm stay at home, but i did want to be ableto pump and have a reserve in the freezer so me and hubby can go out once in awhile!i just tried it for the first time and got 3 ounces out of one breast in about 15 minutesso if i was using both pumps that wouldve been 6 ounces in 15 minutes!which i think is great...especially since it was my first timeever using a pump.definitely recommend for the mom that just wantsto build a nice supply - maybe not for the working mom or someone who is exclusively pumping.i exclusively breastfeed and thisis just for an emergency or the future when i'm finally ready to leave my little man for a few hours...haven't gotten to that point yet!I purchased this pump thinking it would be used occasionally and that it was a good less expensive double electric pump instead of it's double-the-cost rival.Well, long story short, for 6 of the 8 months I nursed I pumped exclusively and this pump was an absolute lifesaver.I would recommend this to anyone.While I've never used the Medela, it cannot beat this thing.Never had a problem, doesn't take long to get the job done, and you cannot beat the price.Considering I spent multiple hours connected to this sucker every single day for 6 months of my life, take my word for it, it's not worth spending double for the other guy, this pump is great.I was going back and forth between this pump and the Medela Pump in Style Advanced.My friend recommended the Medela but I decided to purchase the Lansinoh pump from Amazon instead.I have used it for about 5 months now and below is a list of the what I like about the pump:1) Fast and easy to clean (the tubing doesn't come into contact with your milk so you only need to clean the collection bottles and breast flanges.The Medela pumps tubing is not separate like the Lansinoh and Ameda pumps).2) Lightweight and portable (it weighs less than 2 pounds).3) Easy to use (you can pump both sides at once or just one side.The pump can be battery or electrically operated and is compatible with most standard size bottles for collecting milk).4) Price (much more affordable than the Medela).The pump can be a little noisy at times but I don't mind it.I haven't had any issues with the pump leaking milk either.The main reasons I chose this pump were the price and the fact that the pump tubing doesn't come into contact with the milk.Overall, this pump is a good purchase and I am glad I didn't pay $300 for a Medela!I really wanted to love this pump but it just has too many issues.Two weeks after I started using it one side of the pump malfunctioned.So I contacted Amazon and after complaining twice they replaced it.However once I used the pump with one side only which is marketed to be able to do, the same thing happened, one side started malfunctioning.So I give up, it really has issues.I sold my Be Major because it didn't meet my needs.I don't want to give it a bad review because of this.As all Ju-Ju-Be products, it is very good quality.My phone always seemed like it was going to fall out.The center divider could have used more card slots on the side where you can put pictures.I love Ju Ju Be products and think most of them are worth the money.The Major is NOT one of them.I am a mom of 2, my youngest being 6 months.The reason I wanted this was to fit all of my "must haves" (cell phone, license, money, credit cards, keys) in one small bag that I can transfer to and from diaper bag, purse or just carry on it's one when going out for some quick errands.This is what Ju Ju Be claimed The Major is.Little mirror.which is much smaller than the Iphone and regular droid.I have to push my phone into this pocket HARD to get it in there which means it takes 2 hands and some manipulating to get it out.Flip phones would NOT work either because the pocket while long is so skinny, maybe a 3/4" depth at most.Any phones that have gel protector frames on them would be impossible to get in and out of as well.But the WORST part is that there is a snap to close the pocket.Why would anyone want to push down and snap down on their cell phone???Most phones have large screens these days (except the flip phones which won't fit in there anyway) and it could do MAJOR damage to the cell phone.Snaps and cell phones do NOT work Ju Ju Be.2.What is it with Ju Ju Be and their picture holders?I don't know about you but most mommies that can afford Ju Ju bags have cell phones with cameras on them.This is how moms show pictures these days.Most wallets that have this have a checkbook insert with credit cards slots on both sides.Plus as another reviewer stated, it is very hard to run the zipper around it.The bag is slighly rounded, this extra piece is not and it sticks out.3.Little change area inside - useless, can't get a finger in it.Two things that are hard for moms on the go.You want to something that is just quickly to put back in and out so I find myself just putting it back in the outside change pocket.5.Zipper.It goes around 3/4 of the bag so again, it is a pain to get into.Plus the entire zipper area is raised around the edges so getting into the billfold and taking out credit cards is a pain because you are constantly hitting this edge.7.Key holder.I understand the concept in their diaper bag.A cord to put your keys so you don't lose them thru the massive bag of stuff.At least people with big remote keys for their car.You can keep it hanging outside but it is noisy and annoying.8.Why have a have a wristlet if it doesn't stay on your wrist?It looks in the fold up position all the time and really there is no where to store it in the bag so you have to decide whether you want it hanging off or not.Overall there is just not enough places to put things and it just seems too frumpy overall for something that is supposed to be small and compact.There is no area to just throw something small in.Baggallini bags have much better options for better prices.The product description effectively describes this car seat.I am comparing it to my inexpensive Graco Sport convertible carseat.Pro's:- Britax safety history (side impact cushion technology...watch the video on the Britax site)-Britax reputation-Soft  plush fabric-Overall comfort- Side Impact Protection (including side impact cushion technology)- Push-button latch connectors (makes installation a breeze)- Versa-tether (this was much safer than the Graco one I purchased.When my daughter falls asleep, or becomes tired I can just recline it)- Britax website provides manuals and video installation guidesCon's:- High price- The manual is difficult to understand for installation, but the website has great videos.-Fairly large size-Difficult to recline-I don't know if it is because I am not used to this car seat yet (had it about 3 months), but for some reason it take me longer to get my daughter in and out of it than it did my Graco seat.-No cupholder-The crotch strap is far back and I find myself constantly digging for it.All in all, I don't think the cost outweighs  the benefits of this fancy car seat.I use in my 2000 navigator in a captains chair with lap shoulder and rf tether.We use refacing and plan to until at least 2 yrs old.I don't know if this is now standard on all car seats (this is my first car seat in 13 years) but it impressed me.The seat does not budge at all in my car - and only took about five minutes to install (unlike the infant carrier, which never seemed to be installed properly and took several hours and adults to finally throw their hands in the air and give up - btw, that's the Cosco brand and came with a stroller that is impossible to steer and falling apart after less than 10 uses).And for those of you worried about size, the seat (even fully reclined and rear-facing) fits PERFECTLY in the center of my backseat, without causing discomfort to the driver and passenger (because they have to sit squashed up to the console).I have a Toyota Camry, so this gives you some idea of size.The seat is, however, quite bulky, which means that squeezing two people in the back with the seat might be a stretch.Guess it's time to lose that babyfat!Also, if you are concerned about looks - be warned that those white "wings" are HUGE.I'm not concerned about the fact that the seat doesn't match my interior, I'm worried about how easy it is to spot in the back seat and identify as an insanely expensive car seat (something I hope not too many thiefs are keen on).You can find a good deal for the seat on the Internet, I got mine for less than [...] - including tax and shipping.If you do buy the seat and look for a cover to protect it, I can recommend the Dressy Dribbles toddler-sized seat cover (sold on Amazon through Target).It's soft and will wrap around the headrest (it even has a hole for the click safe).Another handy tip, Safety First makes a shade for strollers, I find you can tuck it around the headrest to block sun that comes in through the rear window (I have a five month old, not yet able to rip it down).No problems, thus far.I'd definitely recommend it.My 15-month old daughter cannot tell you why she likes this seat, but I can tell you that she loves it and, for that reason, we love it too.In the past three months, we have taken two very long trips in our car - trips in excess of 700 miles each way (so, that's four 700+ mile trips) and we have had nary a complaint from her (or our other child, in the diplomat, for that matter).She slept long; she slept well; she rode without complaint or discomfort for hours on end (yes, we made stops, but 14 hours in a car is a long time for a little one - regardless of how you break it up).We also own aBritax Diplomat Convertible Car Seat Onyxand the Advocate essentially dwarfs it.The side impact cushions (my wife calls them pontoons) are substantial and take up a lot of space.If you were doing a lot of short haul and taking your kids in and out, the size of the seat may raise ease of access issues - but it has not been a bother for us.I could go on for a bit about safety and whatnot, but the safety factor is fairly indisputable.How much of a margin do the pontoons add?I used to have a Britax Boulevard until my car was broken into and my insurance damaged that car seat.I thought about getting another Boulevard but opted to upgrade to the Advocate.The only difference is this: SIDE IMPACT.I got the Onyx seat but the Side Impact things are SOOOOOOO UGLY!they're these gray end caps on the seat.Other than that, it really looks/feels/installs just like the Boulevard.This seat is practically the same as the Boulevard and that includes installation.ho hum.INSTALLATION:I wish I had done more research (not on the car seat) but the actual installation of the car seat.We have a Subaru Outback Station Wagon.Thinking that it was a family car, a car seat wouldn't have been an issue.There are only tethers in the roof (near the hatch).There are no tethers in the floor.(When we had the Boulevard, we were rear facing and that was a pain) - now that our seat is Forward Facing, It's not as bad.It makes it hard to keep the seat secure AND at those degrees.When we tethered it up, it looked like the seat was being pulled upright.Sitting up on his own.Britax has a lot of extra padding to make the straps bearable, there's a padded cushion that is useful to make sure the strap doesn't dig into his neck.There's a way to fold the flaps/sides in so it gives a snugger fit for smaller babies.Looks like there will be plenty of room to grow.Headrest: Easily moves up and down.Wish the side flaps weren't so stiff.Looks like a "big boy" seat and blends in well with my car.It looks great in my car.Took a bit of fussing but well worth it.He could see some stuff in his infant carrier but not really that great.(I wish that car seats came with it's own carrier bag b/c I hate having to find one that fits - for the $ that these seats are, I'd think that's a fair request).I ordered this car seat because my daughter is going to outgrow her Chicco Keyfit infant seat soon.It seemed like the safest car seat on the market.It will not fit in our Dodge Dakota or my Subaru Outback so we are returning it.Granted, my husband and I are tall (I am 5'8" and he is 6'2") so we can't drive with our seats all the way forward, but even putting it in the middle position of the back seat will not work.I'm very sad because I don't think I'll find a safer seat out there and this thing looks supremely comfortable, but since buying two vehicles isn't an option we are going to return it and try a Britax Diplomat.Yes, this plate can be picked up, but it's much harder to pick up than most and it won't slide around on the table.Since the profile is so low to the table and there's no rim for her to grab, she doesn't even think about it as long as she's got food.She only turns it over when it's empty.So for those of you who have had trouble, try with a slightly older baby.here are the flaws:* the plate is hollow on the bottom, so it can flip easy* because of the hollow bottom the non slip rubber is just a ring.it rips easy and bites even easier.* doesn't wear well* easy to pick up which leads to it being on the floor food and all* made in chinagood things:* colors are nice* divided area is good size and keeps it seperated* good price for a few uses* claims to be made of safe plastici mainly just keep it as a diaper bag staple, not that worried if we lose it or it breaks.i would NOT recommend it, nor would i replace it if ours broke.Also, certain changing pad covers can cause the entire pad to slide when you are lifting a larger infant's legs during changing.Really inexplicable except for poor quality?Not sure I would recommend since it's starting to get ratty looking already.I bought a different product that was too long (didn't realize they come in different sizes), and had 3 sides so didn't fit the comfy covers I'd already got.It washes clean but I still like the covers on to make it softer.I wish the bottom was firmer (its quite firm but not totally rigid), for putting on the covers I have.Worked great.I found this on Amazon for half the price of other places.The padding is soft and easy to clean.Highly recommend this product.Best idea ever.In fact, since it's still on sale I am going to buy another one to keep downstairs in my house (pregnant again and having some issues that make it hard to get around, so for this price it will be worth it to have a spare pad downstairs).Do cover it though, I recently noticed that my upstairs pad has a small tear in it, and I always keep it covered.Also, if you get one of these for the car, it would probably feel cold to the baby in the winter months, so you do still want to buy an extra cover.I have a Honda CRV and the seats aren't flat (nor should they be) which makes changing his diapers such a production!It's very cushy and the surface is so easy to clean (with just a regular wet wipe).Great for our vacations and trips in the car!VERY easy to clean.I would definitely recommend this.Great buy for a great price.I couldn't believe how much more expensive they were at other Baby Stores.Great product and even better price!We use PeeWees disposable covers with this and the two have been great!!I would recommend this to anyone!!We used the safety strap and attached it to the wall with a heavy screw - it stopped our son from kicking the table over when I reached for his clothes that were located behind me.Sometimes we even take it into the living room for her to lay on when she is fussy.I did a lot of research and reviews reading and found this one.It's long enough to handle a growing baby and the sides do curve nicely.The only thing is that I have it on top of his dresser because I didn't see the need for a changing table, so I had to get a non slip mat like the kinds you put under rugs or in your cabinets for dishes to keep it in place.I assumed these things were smaller.I bought this toy unsure if it would roll well enough.It rolls just fine and the holes are a bonus making it extremely easy for baby to grab hold of it.All they have to do is reach a hand out and most likely they will knock it about or grab hold.The jingle ball inside of it is an added stimulation bonus.I definitely recommend this product.My 6 month old loves this ball.It's not really bendy but it's great cause she can actually hold onto it through the holes.This toy is fun, cute, and rattles.Isn't that all you can ask of a ball anyway?I originally ordered this for my 4-mo old grandson.When my 9-mo old granddaughter went to visit she was crazy for it.Of course grandma had to get her one of her own!Great product.Two thumbs up!Our boy started playing with this ball at around 3 months.Easy to clean and solidly built.He LOVES his bendy ball!!It's really easy for him to grab and hang on to.My almost 4 month old started playing with it as soon as I took it out of the packaging.It is an outstanding toy for development.There are two reasons why I annot give it a 5 star rating: 1) it is on the small side, and, even at $6, it's a so-so deal.2) It's too easy for slightly older babies and toddlers to get their hands stuck trying to retrieve the little rattle ball.Otherwise this is a great toy, and I do recommend it despite my personal beefs.However, our daughter loves to grab the ball and bang it against everything that is near her (our poor dog!).Our daughter can easily grab the ball but NOT get her entire hand stuck inside the ball.- The ball inside the ball acts as a rattle.We got this for my daughter when she was a month or two.She would just stare at it forever.Now that she can hold it she just turns it in her hands for long periods of time.It really keeps her attention.The Bendy Ball is very easy for a baby to hold onto.My daughter is almost six months old now and loves this toy.I like this toy very much.Looks like a dog toy.We thought it was much bigger than it actually is.The rubber is not the softest and the ratteler inside could get annoying.Not as bendy as we thought.For the price it was not worth it...but at least i can give it to the dog...cheaper than buying a dog toy.He likes it, but definately don't let them play unattended...I was trying to limit plastic toys, but my baby loves this one!He has lots of fun trying to get it in his mouth, and i like that the sides are not hard (though not soft) because he can't hurt himself on it.Also, it is not too noisy... the jingle bell interests him but doesn't drive me batty!It is cute and small and the first day i gave it to her she grabbed it and held it so that was a plus.She is only 4 months so finding toys that are right for her to hold is kind of hard.He is now almost 7 months and he still constantly plays with it, and if he is crying, shaking it quickly stops the crying.Excellent toy!At 1 month-old he had no coordination.He would just kick his legs, and I would suspend the ball on the links in front of his feet.It was an easy target.He was not afraid of the soft jingle sound.It was the first time he could hear/see his movements were having an effect on something outside himself.It was the first time I saw my little guy having "fun playing".The pediatrician remarked on the muscle tone of his legs.Now, at four months, he uses his toes to pull it to his hands so he can hold it.A toy that keeps growing with baby!We got this toy for our son for Christmas.He will be 3 months old.We were slightly dissapointed by the fact that the ball was smaller than expected and it didn't seem to be made of good quality material as in the picture.It reminds us more of a dog toy than a baby toy.After receiving this as a gift, I contacted the company that produces this toy to ask whether the plastic contains any BPA, PVC, or phthalates.I received a form reply, indicating that their plastics comply with federal law for children's products but failing to actually answer my question regarding the content of the plastic.It rolls fairly well on carpet and wood floor which also encourages my son to roll and crawl after it.The ball is small enough to pack in the diaper bag and is super easy to clean.Baby (9 months+) likes to bang it.She does not use it like a ball yet but she likes looking at the colors and putting it in her mouth.This little ball doesn't look like much but the design is great!It is colorful and the jingle is a nice noise rather than a loud obnoxious sound it is quite soothing to hear.Recommend this one for every baby!He's bored after 5 minutes.He likes to bang it on things, even accidentally hits his own head sometimes doing so.He's tuff, doesn't bother him.6 months.This ball was one of the first toys my baby boy could hold.Because of the holes, his little fingers could grab right onto it.The only thing he didn't like about the ball was that he couldn't fit it into his mouth.At nine months, he still plays with it.He can throw it or rattle it or chew on it.Great toy.It's a real 'soft' plastic and very flexible so even with his habit of banging everything he gets in his hands against either his body or his pack-n-play it doesn't worry us.A little heavy for my 5 month old.He likes to hold it, but will probably enjoy it more when he's a little older (try the Oball Rattle for babies under 6 months).We introduced this toy to our 5 month old and he really likes it.His little fingers can grab the ball easily, he shakes it and throws it to hear the rattle and it has nice bright colors.It doesn't roll very far because of the little caterpillar along the outside and I'm not really sure how to feel about that!On one hand, I'm glad I'm not constantly chasing it down after he throws it but on the other, eventually he'll want to roll a ball around smoothly.It's cheap enough this isn't much of a price issue rather than a longevity issue.This will probably go in the baby toys needing to be packed away instead of something timeless.The quality of the product is great; I've been smacked in the head with it and it doesn't hurt as much as headbutts, flailing arms or other various things babies do to abuse their parents.I know every baby has different tastes, and maybe I waited too long to buy this (my son is 8 months), but he doesn't seem too interested in it.I was more excited about this toy than he seems to be.But maybe he'll gain some interest as he's starting to become interested in things that roll or have wheels.When I took this ball out of the box, I was initially quite disappointed.It seemed like too much money to pay for a simple ball.However, I changed my mind after I gave it to my 3.5 month old daughter to play with.I can only imagine that she will have even more fun with it after she gets older and learns how to roll it on the floor.I also take this toy along when we go somewhere.I attach a Boogin' Head pacifier clip to it, and attach the other end of the clip to her clothing so it doesn't get lost.She loves this toy... she just can't figure out how to get the ball out of the middle ; ) It's a great attention keeper.This is a great toy for infants.Because of all the holes, it makes it easy for little uncoordinated hands to grasp and hold.I would recommend for 3- to 9-month olds.I can use the underarm tip for my preschooler and the rectal tip for my baby.2 kids, 1 thermometer.2.The tips are easy to clean without fear of destroying the whole thing3.easy to store, handy chart included.What I don't like:1.Takes FOREVER to get an underarm temp.ick.for a quick walk outside with my baby!This was a nice way to add some storage on our stroller.It attaches easily to the stroller and is well made.I recommend this to anyone needing a little more spots to store things on their stroller.!I purchased 2 of these a couple years ago and still using them!They've taken a lot of abuse and the only issue we've had so far are the velcro straps breaking off of the mesh bag - due to our own bogging down the bags with very heavy items.Perfect for airline travel, letting you take a smaller stroller and still have a lot of storage capabilities.The opening to the mesh bag is smaller than the mesh, but stretchy so it holds items in there well and my daughter can even reach in there and get what she wants.I can fold up the stroller and nothing will fall out of these mesh slings!I like mesh storage so you can see what you're digging around for and so can my daughter.The velcro has grippies on the inside to stay put on a stroller, however, if you load it up with heavy items, it will slip.Most strollers have a few points where you can place the bag so it can't slide down so no problem.I recently tested this out on the Radio Flyer Stroll & Go Trike and it completely solved my storage dilemma for outings with the trike!I'm actually ordering two more so I don't have to keep switching them out.I guess other people found this helpful, which is why I registered for it.But when I tried filing my newborn's nails, nothing happened.the vibration is really strong and I worried about "overfiling" my baby's nails.I would not recommend.This is the 3rd thermometer we have bought & the most expensive & still completely useless.I've researched ear thermometers for a while and finally decided on this one even if some reviews say that it was inaccurate.I tried 3 more times just in case and they all turned out to the same temperature.I did this because I read a review that said they got different temperature readings when they took the temperature right after another.Later on in the day my son got fussy so I took his temperature again.I took his temperature 2 more times and it showed the same fever temperature again, so I gave him his medicine and he got better.I am happy with this thermometer because it is easy to use and gives you readings quickly.I saw on a TV show...the doctor said the problem with ear thermometers is that you need to be sure you are aiming it at the child's eardrum.If not then you may get an inaccurate reading.My husband also was able to take his temperature easily and the results were consistent.Overall I like this thermometer.For such a small price, now I can just throw it away and have three new ones.The mushier things like banana and avocado are harder to get out even if you soak and even if you brush it under running water.I have just learned to live with it looking a bit dirty so long as I clean it really well.One of the other reviews suggested soaking it in OxyClean overnight and how it the fibers come right out and it looks brand new.I'd rather spend and extra dollar or two and buy a new one (or three pack in this case).Just dedicate one to the mushy foods.This was the second type of bottle we tried for our daughter who is primarily breastfeed.She took to these immediatly and we have never had a problem.The only down side is the liners do get expensive after a while, so if you were exclusively bottle feeding these could get expensive pretty fast.The original drop in's bottle shape does not work with the new "expandable" liners.With this bottle shape, the ounces finally line up!But no matter how hard I try, 10oz does NOT fit!I wish they'd go back to the old liners.My daughter is on hypoallergenic formula and I have never had a leakage issue while shaking the bottle, although I do use liquid and not powder, not sure if this would work for powdered formula.These bottles leak badly if using them for a formula-fed baby.When you shake the bottle it begins to leak where the liner and the cap meet--awful!I am regretting purchasing these.I use these bottles with the brown nipple and it's all he nurses from when not at the breast.Plus these are great because you just drop in the liner and throw away when done.Easy to travel with and easy to clean.Couldn't be more low maintenance than this!My daughter has been teething since 3 mos.It is so hard i'm scared she will break the teeth she does have!I wish it was more rubbery then it would be a good teether.He is now 9 months and has yet to use this product other than to throw it on the floor.It is very hard and rubbery, not shaped to fit the mouth at all, and the part that the baby is supposed to bite down on is quite small.It was a waste of money for us.It's not like he's going to grow up to be the next Charles Manson because of it (For reference:  Manson's mother supposedly liked to make little Charlie wear dresses which may or may not have been a contributing factor to the way he "behaved" as an adult).I needed another set of tubing because I found a hair in mine (I'm sure it came from our house, not from the manufacturer).This arrived promptly and was exactly the same that I'd received with the pump.(Tubing is hard to find, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon - I could not find it in Target or Babies R Us).Both Daddy and Mommy can be in here with her without it being crowded, and it's insanely easy to assemble and reconfigure.I wish I had this 4 children back!Great for outside activities while mom is trying to get things done in the yard.I ordered this Play Pen with the Extention Kit, theStep 2 WaterWheel Activity Play Table, and theLittle Tikes Swing Along Castle.Durable enough to pass down to siblings, cousins, friends or sell at a garage sale when finished (which I will never do - It is too useful!!)The first baby monitor we purchased was a color video monitor, and we spent aver $150 on it.I won't get into the details, but we relied so heavily on the video aspect that one day my wife and I didn't realize that the picture had frozen up, and our sixth-month old, upstairs and on the other side of the house, had been crying for who-knows how long.I felt horrible, and right away we ordered this Philips AVENT Baby Monitor to, at the very least, supplement the video monitor.We had both monitors working simultaneously for a few weeks.The video monitor kept "locking up" on one image of my son, while on the AVENT monitor, I could clearly hear him (mind you, the video monitor also had sound, and apparently it wasn't very good.If I can ever find that monitor, I'll write a review for IT, too!).Soon, we just ditched the video monitor (which was quite a novelty for a while) and kept the AVENT.It works wonderfully.It is a sensative unit, obviously much better-built than the video one had been, both the transmitter and the receiver.We can also clearly see the temperature and humidity level in the room, both of which are handy when your little one has a stuffy nose or the croup, for example.The base unit also plays a variety of lullabies.The battery life of the rechargable handset is excellent; it can stay on for more than a day at a time, and it will quickly recharge.I am very impressed with the Philips AVENT; it is a bit steep for the $150 range, but as I learned from my experience with the other monitor, quality is very important with baby monitors, and this unit has commendable quality.I do recommend this product, gladly.This is a great baby monitor.I have had the graco audio monitor and summer infant video monitor.I have always wanted to get a philips audio monitor because of the two way talking feature..but refrained from gettin one for the same reason that I have deducted 1/2 star....I would rather have a two way video monitor.As for the product...Its extremely sleek and not space consumingthere is very little to no static in the hand unit even in the restroomconsidering the amount of gadgets i have in my house...i am pretty surprised at the fact that the unit is so quiet.On disconnection of the room unit..it beeps unlike all other monitors that give a loud white noise which only startles us.I love the feature where we can talk...makes me wana gift this to the elderly in the family who need constant attention and help.the humidity and temperature sensor is a great addition to make sure the temperature around the baby is optimum.love the lullabies in the same...though my baby doesnt really sleep with them..more like dances with them..i am sure some children do appreciate these better.All in all a great product...just having a video component with it will possibly make it the only monitor people would want or need.Wow!I love the 2 way monitor.I love the soothing sounds.They have really come in handy when the baby was fussy.The thermometer is handy too!You won't be disappointed with this purchase.For that reason alone, it is ALMOST worth the cost of the total package.The music is soothing, not annoying.The sound is very clear and allows you to talk back to baby from wherever you are, which is also really nice.There have been many occassions where we've talked to baby to let her know that we hear her.We've had no problems whatsoever with that.One previous model we tried was always getting caught on things and ripped off of my pocket, sometimes to the detriment of the box.My only suggestion for improvement here would be regarding the music.When you play the music, it only lasts for about 15 minutes of total playtime.It would be much better if it could last longer to give baby more time to lull to sleep.That would make this just about perfect (and a slightly lower price).The monitor has a digital display on top that shows the room's current temperature and humidity level.You can set an alarm to go off if either goes beyond your desired threshold.The monitor also has a dim nightlight and lullabies that play.The cordless parental unit charges quickly and holds the charge for several days.It also shows the temperature an humidity in the baby's room.It has a button on the side like a walkie-talkie so you can speak to your child through the monitor.That, for me, is the best aspect of this monitor.Other monitors I've used always screech with some sort of static while I'm walking around with them.This monitor has other uses besides just for your baby.When another child of mine got a stomach virus and we isolated him in his room, we put the monitor in there to use as an intercom.I am extremely happy with this Philips Avent monitor.I was so very excited when I recieved my Podee bottle.I cleaned it and put my son's milk in it right away.It look all of 5 seconds for him to pull the tube out of the bottle and spill the milk everywhere.My son is 7.5 months old so he wants to chew on everything and the tube was his main target not the nipple.The main complaint I have about this product is that with one yank the tube comes off and if the baby does that a couple of times it widens the ends of the tube so it doesn't fit around the bottle attachement very well.This product was not for us, it was a waste of money only because it didn't even last 1 minute.Very disappointed.Really had high hopes for handsfree feeding...too good to be true.Right now all I have are the fabric samples from Cocalo Azania, but this appears to be a perfect match!They are so soft, they won't be disappointed.And take it from me: the baby will eventually be an older kid and ASK for that soft blanket.Love this product.We could not justify paying the extra $100 for the Marathon when it seemed as if there weren't $100 worth of differences between it and the Roundabout.The shoulders have 4 different height adjustments, and the crotch has 3 different slots.It will also be good for her to grow into.The material is so luxurious and plush - she seems very comfortable while sleeping in it.Recently we installed a new Cosco hand-me-down (seems like an oxymoron, but our cousins gave us a convertible carseat they never used) in my wife's car.Using that carseat has made me appreciate the Britax so much more.Our other carseat also doesn't seem safe - the first day she was in it, she fell asleep, and when my wife got home she realized her head was hanging off the side of the carseat (this hasn't happened since the first time, so it may not be a design flaw)!They have changed the design and have upped the new Roundabout to 55 lbs - yay!The new Roundabout 55 has side impact wings - another plus.More carseat for the same price!I know some people keep their kids in longer, but he seems uncomfortable with his feet against my real seat.The installation is super simple with the latch system and trunk anchor.I picked up a weird pattern at Target for $149 - sale price in this week's circular.My family has about 5 britax's and we are very happy with their products.We got this walker for our 9 month old and she loves it.It's super easy to put together and appears to be built pretty sturdily.The walker moves well on hardwood floors and even okay on carpet.Cute and useful!She's over 3 now, and it looks almost like new.The only flaw is from when I accidentally set the plate on a hot burner.The back side has a burn mark, but somehow the front never got damaged- even with that heat, the image never bubbled or peeled.Other character plates start to show cut marks from silverware really easily.This set never did.The bowl is like new and the plate nearly so.Buy it!After trying a bunch of different diapering systems, my husband and I settled on Thisties fitted and Thirsties covers.The main reason being that this is the only cloth diaper my husband, who was super skeptical about cloth, will tolerate using.Checking for a wet diaper is super easy, we just unvelcro one wing of the cover and touch the fitted diaper to see if it's wet.My baby is currently 3.5 months old, and we've had no leaks, blow outs, or accidents to date with the Thirsties system.His explosive watery breast-fed poo has only managed to leak out of the fitted diaper a handful of times and hasn't made it past the cover yet.I know the diaper gets covered, but I enjoy looking at the brightly colored diapers while doing laundry and putting them on.I bought a bunch of white ones, but they are used last.For the person who gave the poor review based on the fact that they require a cover, I think they were looking for All-in-ones.These are fitteds, not all-in-ones.If you want to use these diapers without a cover, you have to be prepared to deal with a damp diaper either by changing it immediately or putting the baby on a surface that can get wet.The shipping was prompt, but my box didn't come with laundry instructions.I thought that because the diapers are mostly made of polyester, they would be ready to go (absorbent)after just a quick rinse to remove anything leftover from manufacturing and set the color.I thought wrong.Though the diapers are a cotton/poly combo, they must be washed in hot water at least three times and then dried completely in the dryer for maximum absorbency.I found this out the hard way...by using them after only a hot water rinse!The laundering instructions can be found on the Thirsties website.The velcro has begun to curl up recently (after about four weeks of use).After that one time in the dryer, they have been line dried.and 25 inches long.Overall, an okay fitted diaper.When I saw this glow-in-the-dark one, I thought we just had to have it.As with all glow-in-the-dark products, you have to "charge" it by holding it up to a light source for a few seconds (the longer the better) for it to glow....but when you do, it surely is bbbbrrriiiiggghhhhttt!!!!And it stays that way for quite some time, long enough for my little one to fall asleep comfortably (I keep it next to his bed at night and it slowly dims as he falls asleep).It is super bouncy and has a valve for you to deflate or inflate as needed.I plan to use this for a long time and take advantage of its convertibility.Just a quick word to those moms out there who go for the entire bedding ensembles (like me)...even though it's pictured with one, the mattress sits too low even on the highest option to accommodate a crib skirt (at least the ones from Pottery Barn Kids, but aren't they all about the same size?)and have it look nice, and although you can probably adjust it to accomodate that first level, you'll just keep having to alter/tailor it as you lower the mattress, so save your money on those.It's a standard-sized crib that takes a standard 52x28 mattress.My husband had no problems putting it together.I finally ordered this crib after looking at lots (and I mean lots) of cribs and their reviews.It fits a standard sized 52 x 28 crib mattress; the difference is that it doesn't sit as high as other standard cribs but, for me, this was what I was wanting and looking for.After doing alot of reading and research on SIDS (since my husband had a daughter who died from SIDS), we paired this with a Naturepedic Organic mattress and CozyWedge bumpers (instead of the traditional bumpers which can pose a suffocation hazard), and our five-month old son has had no problems sleeping peacefully in this crib.**UPDATE 6/11/2011**: I now have this crib in the cherry color so that makes two of them that I have purchased...shows how much I love this crib!I had originally wanted a cherry color which was unavailable when I purchased the cappuccino colored crib.One review noted that there appeared to be "holes" in the wood of the crib in order to give it the distressed look.This second crib was as easy to put together as the first one, and looks just as fabulous.I have also not had the issues that others have had with being able to find a mattress that fits.**Edited to add:  the manufacturers are a pain to deal with.Graco is just the distributor, LaJobi is the mfr.I forgot about that, lost the electronic copy and emailed them again, and had to go through the same annoying hassle.It's not a national secret, it's just the directions.Very easy to put together, decent directions, and looks nice when completed.There is one board that goes underneath that seems to have no purpose (decorative?), that was a little confusing.Our only issue was that it was damaged during shipping- a hole punched through the middle of the box that bent a small area of the box spring and chipped the wood on one of the slats.We did not consider this a big enough issue to send it back, but contacted the manufacturer to let them know and that they might want to consider another shipper.Turns out the manufacturer is replacing the whole side of the crib where the chip is!Quick and hassle-free set up with good instructions.By far the easiest piece of baby equipment we've put together.Nice, solid feel to the wood and the finished crib.The wood does have a rustic look with small "nail" holes in the wood (I'm sure there's a real name for this technique?), and an uneven finish color.The holes aren't visible in the picture and might be an unwelcome surprise for some, but by pure accident they match the finish of the dresser we already had.LOVE that there is no dropside, especially as more and more recalls come out for dropsides.We were also able to "sidecar" this crib to our bed pretty easily, after converting it to the "toddler bed" configuration.I was 7 months pregnant and put it together by myself.It is shorter than most cribs, but I dont see that as a problem, just different.I am 5'6" and my husband is 6'3", it doesnt bother either one of us.Well made and affordable!I wanted a crib that was classic and plain with a great finish on it.This Crib was it!I purchased this mattress for my son three months ago when he transitioned from a bassinet to a crib, and he is seven and a half months old now.My significant other had a daughter in his previous marriage who died of SIDS when she was 7 months old, and you can bet that I read all the research and looked at lots (and I mean LOTS) of crib mattresses before making the decision to buy this one.The first thing I noticed about this mattress when I opened it....no chemical-y smell.You can tell that the mattress is extremely well-made and will last for a long, long time.I wanted the dual firmness mattress so that my son can use it as a toddler bed when he is older.The firm side is labeled, so you know which side is which.In the three months we've had this mattress, my son has not had any problems with getting a peaceful and good night's sleep on it.I would highly recommend this mattress to new moms and/or anyone who is concerned about SIDS or the chemicals in non-organic mattresses.We were concerned because our shower diverter is on the back of the spout, but it went on okay and doesn't obstruct use of the shower.The little fins are the adjuster to tighten it, nice product design.If the cover didn't slip off of the faucet or if my toddler wasn't able to pull it off easily, I suppose this faucet cover might work well.This is a great spout cover.It fits well on my standard spout with shower pull, and and my son is unable to get it off.My son loves to play with the spout, and this cover offers the protection I was looking for.I love the design, and love my other Skip Hop products (diaper bag especially).(We tighten the fins, and take it off after each bath.)Also, our toddler likes to take this and play with it at the end of the bath in the tub.So it wins on cuteness for kids too.We noticed mold after a few months of use, even after taking care to air it out from its hook/tail.It tends to collect in the small crevice under the whale's spout on the inside of the cover, and we really need to scrub to get it out.Now, after about nine months of use, there's pretty bad mold growth on the curve of the tail too.My son is always walking around in the bath tub and is very interested in the spout so when he has leaned over and then stood back up, he's bumped his head, but it didn't hurt/phase him because of this product!It looks cute and is easy enough to tighten to fit your spigot's width.Sometimes slips but it just needs to be tightened.It doesn't interfere much when you're in the tub and want to raise the diverter to have your shower..I never thought this was a problem but perhaps someone will find it as a slight "inconvenience."Just a heads up there!Overall, a great product that works like a charm!I use to have the Sassy Soft Spout Tub Guard frog, which is absolutely useless in every way, I replaced it for this one, we have a long thin modern spout, and kind of nothing can be attached to it, the plus of this spout guard is that you can tighten it sideway using the whale flippers, which make looks ours like an anorexic dolphin, but at least, does the job properly :)This is a simple, sleek design and this little guy does exactly what it's supposed to.Everything about this product is functional and attractive at the same time.It's the perfect spout cover!This spout cover is suitable for faucets with a shower diverter on top - the shower switch goes in Moby's "blow hole" and it keeps it stabilized.Ignore the negative reviews complaining that this slips off faucets without a shower switch - that's not this product's fault!This is great for a child/baby's bathtub.The little whale covers up the bathtub spout, yet allows you to use the pull-up knob feature to turn on the shower.I think it is very cute and well designed.Our baby's not here yet, but I got this because a bath spout cover seemed like a smart thing to have.Friends of ours have the Elmo one, and it frustrated me because I could not use the tub as a shower unless I took the cover off.This is a great product that does the job.The cover I have is a darker shade--a really attractive blue.It's made out of a harder rubber which makes it not too hard but not too soft.It seems like so many faucet covers were either just as hard as the faucet itself, or they were those inflatable ones that seem like they'd get a hole in them super easily.It's really easy to put on the faucet and even easier to adjust it.You pull on either side of the whale's flippers to tighten the cover.Great, great product.I'd buy again.Overall, a good product.It is very easy to get on and off the spout and the tail is a hanger when you want to clean the spout, etc.My son likes the whale and wants to play with him but he can't figure out how to get it off the spout.Looks great and does it's purpose- fits over the faucet so our toddler doesn't get hurt during bath time.Plan on buying as gifts for family w/ kids.This fits perfectly over our spout.It is cute and made well.The only issue is it is hard to get my small hands inside to pull up the faucet to shower knob on top.But overall I recommend it.So the little guy finally outgrew his infant/toddler tub even at 8 months old.The metal spout is a hazard, so what to do?This spout cover is cute, does the job and is really, really cute.For $9, you preserve your baby's head from a big banging and a possible ER trip.Totally worth it.A definite buy.Other than that I still do like it and its not a problem to slip back on.I like how its made out of safe plastic and you can adjust the fins for tightness on the tub spout.Its well designed and looks like it will hold up over time for the next kid to use as well.snaps in place easy.I decided to try the Softfit just to see and I see no difference in feeling.Possibly they're too small for me.I do like that it's got a shorter funnel tube part thingy.But they function.This is the best shell out there.It prevents too much rubbing on nipples especially when you are first starting to breast feed.Issues I had:1.They are obvious if you are wearing a thin cotton bra and 1 layer shirt.On me it was very obvious that I was wearing a round thing over my breasts.Looser tops probably wouldn't be an issue nor would a double layer top which some nursing clothes are.3.I sort of believe that they made my thrush worse.Not something I would wear often and not something I would use for the year of breastfeeding.I love Dr. Browns 3.5 oz glass bottles and thought these were essentially the same just a little bigger.I am SO frustrated with them however because after I got these 4 oz bottles home and washed them (so I can't return them, nuts!)This means i can't connect them directly to my Medela pump, and I can't use the medela storage covers on them.Very frustrating.I had 4 of these in the 8oz and 2 in the 4 oz bottles.I loved them that is until two of them (both 8oz broke) They both broke in the same way, cracking in a ring around the bottom.Very disappointing.I was happy to have the glass version because I just know that sooner or later they will find something else wrong with plastic but at 12.00 a pop I can't be replacing these every month and it makes me concerned that they will break while my baby is using it.Love glass but stick with plastic on these.Update, I must mention that the day after I wrote this another bottle broke so I contacted Handi Craft's customers service center.I had a response within 1 business day and they are replacing the broken glass bottles with plastic ones free of charge.I am impressed.I do still recommend the bottle just in the plastic version.I had researched many different mats for my son to play on.We have hardwood floors so I wanted to make sure the mats I selected had a lot of cushion to them.I also had read many reviews on other products about peeling mats or mats with strong odors, or mats that had smaller pieces that could be removed and that would pose potential problems.This product had none of those things.I am very happy with this product because the material is super soft and it is very well made.The delivery time was fast even with free shipping.Thanks Amazon and the other reviewers for helping me make a good purchase!Soooo soft!I got both sets.The long one for the front and the set of two short ones for the ends.Just put these on today.I'm so impressed I had to write a review!I will add to this if it ends up not working out.But I can't imagine that.It's a must for every crib!And I imagine it would fit ANY crib.I looked at a few.I would recommend this to everyone and will be giving it as a shower gift in the future!Bought 1 long rail and 2 short rails in green fleece.They are SOOO soft!The product does it's job (i.e.protecting the crib from my toddler's sharp teeth).However, it had flaws right out of the package.One of the holes in each of the pieces was way too small for the tie piece to fit through, so I had to crudely cut the holes to make them bigger.It looks fine if you can see that part, but it is annoying that such a simple and overpriced product would have issues.I also didn't have to worry about adhesives damaging the wood which was a big plus for me!It's soft, easy to install, and no chance of damaging the wood as others do with adhesives.Because my son's crib will one day turn into his full sized bed, not damaging the wood was a big priority for us.At first I only purchased the long piece for the front of the crib to try it out and after only a week of using it, I decided to purchase the two short ones for the sides too.We couldn't be happier with it.I would recommend these to everyone!There are no frayed fibers.It's a good quality product and I recommend it.very good, looks good and it does what suppose to do: protects the baby's teeth and the crib; love itVery useful for little ones who are teething.Not sure what all the other reviews meant about the stuffing coming out.They must have changed the style of this since then because there is no batting coming out anywhere.Also, the review that said the lining shifts when washing...again, not applicable.So it doesn't shift.Again, only thing I can think of is that it was redesigned.This style is great, although velcro would be preferred over ties.All in all, great product.We purchased these for our Dutalier Crib.The thickness of some of the wood pieces have made finding mobiles and things that affix to the side of the crib difficult.While putting this on the crib was tight, it did work and has stayed in place very well.I wish they would make the ties longer and allow you to cut them to length.I would definitely buy them again.We waited until 10 month old daughter had already put a couple of marks on her expensive crib before ordering this, so don't make that mistake!Doesn't quite cover the entire side of my crib because of shape of ends.I didn't know that there was a solution for this problem till I searched on amazon and I found those rail guard.If I turn down the front to fit my newborn baby it makes it so super bulky on him that he can't fit his clothes, even if I go a size bigger.I have to turn down a good 4-5 inches at least.I wish the seller would specify that they are premium size.I'm going to end up trimming them to fit.This really is the best way to go in terms of price.Both CDs and disposables should be changed, on average, every two hours to avoid rashes, even if the disposable feels moderately dry.I use a doubler at night, though.)However, once my baby got to be 8 pounds (the average size of babies at birth), the diapers didn't fit well around him, and at ten pounds, they barely reach around his legs.These will still work as liners for diaper covers, as doublers, and burp cloths, but I won't be able to pin them any more.Bottom line: for newborns, get two dozen.Don't forget diaper covers.For infants 9 lbs and up, don't expect to be able to pin these or use Snappi fasteners with them for long.Fold in thirds and lay into the diaper cover, or use as a double layer, or use as a burp cloth.Most children's utensils are too dull to do anything.I don't think I could be more pleased with this product.I had plenty of the tiny baby spoons, but my daughter reached the point of eating things better eaten with a fork.So I set out looking for some toddler silverware.Forks were hard to come by, and to my amazement and confusion, pretty much all plastic.Well I could just see that frustrating a poor kid trying to stab food for the first time.Then I came across this set, and said "that's it!"The handles are nice and rubbery, making them easier for my daughter to hold on to.They are not too long, like most of the baby spoons, which are meant more for parents feeding the kids than the kids feeding themselves.My daughter would try to hold them more at the end of the handle, and that didn't work too well.Of course, it's completely dull; she's not going to hurt herself or anything, but it's something for her to practice with and also to help occupy her during mealtime if she gets restless before my husband and I are through eating.Since these are actually metal utensils, they are very functional, and I know they will last well through my daughter outgrowing them and into a second child.I understand the frustration of some reviewers regarding the color selection.However, when I compared the price of this item with buying the exact same item with color specification, I could have cared less what they sent me.These are longer than the forks and spoons we had been using for my toddler.The longer version here makes it easier for my son to eat and not spill.He also sees us cutting our food and wants to be like us, so the knife is good for him to start getting used to cutting his foods without you worrying about him hurting himself.They are the right size for my toddler, aren't some weird shape but still have enough size to them that they are easy for his hands to hold.They go in the dishwasher with everything else and so far (6mo+) have been indistrucable.I chose this brand of kids' silverware because it comes with a knife.My boys wanted to have a knife just like Mommy and Daddy but baby knives are hard to find.The knife in this set looks real but is really very dull and totally safe for kids.Just sell the green/yellow instead of making customers gamble Amazon![...] is using a new "picker" that randomly selects the product so it would have been a color gamble with them also.We'll just use the pink ones at home.I ordered 2 sets of these, one for each of my kids, and I'm in love with them!So much that I'm getting rid of some others and replacing with these.Things I love: You get a knife with some weight to it.Next, the spoon is actually the right depth.My other kiddie spoons come in two versions- almost flat (read:everything falls out) and too deep (read: my toddler only gets half the bite each time.)Well made, BPA free, ergonomic for little hands, I'm in love!I have tried every product out there to keep my (very smart) toddler out of the cabinets.This is the only thing that worked.This diaper cover feels like rain coat material.The legs leak often for my baby who is 12 pounds.This cover would probably work better with babies who have chunkier thighs and those who weigh over 15 pounds.My baby is 8 months old and has loved it and fell asleep to it since he was a newborn.He loves it and he knows when it comes on that its time to go to sleep.It will soothe him to sleep and he also likes to play with it after he wakes from his nap.My baby just didn't care about mobiles at all so I this to try it out.She fell in love immediately.Now she's goes to bed with less fussing!My only complaint is that, just like all other toys I've tried, it didn't fit normally on her crib.My daughter doesn't have a standard crib and none of the toys or mirrors made to latch onto the sides fit her crib.So I had to tie it onto the side and cut the strings so she can't gt at them.So just a warning to moms, if you have a non standard crib this may not fit.I really wanted to love this crib soother.It has all my favorite animals, so I think it's just adorable.But sadly, I see a few faults in it.Here's my list of pros and cons...Pros- very cute- lights are nice, not too bright in my opinion- choice of lullaby music, classical, or nature sounds- 4 sound levels, including 'off'- a sound only option (no motion)Cons- when in motion, there's an annoying grinding noise.I can even hear it through the baby monitor- the small buttons would be harder for a baby to push.My daughter had one that pushed where the monkey is, making her able to play with it at only 5 months- the music doesn't have the best tone to it- the music is kind of loud, even on the softest setting.- if it's set on 'motion and sound' it only plays for 5 minutes.This isn't long enough!My other issue with the product is that it doesn't have a ceiling projector.Also, even with the Dreamland Soother set to 'ceiling show, motion, and sound', it played a lot longer than 5 minutes, so I don't understand why this soother can't play longer.Also, mine came with some scratches on the front of it.I'm not sure if this is an issue with Fisher Price or with Target, but it was disappointing nonetheless.Overall, I'll probably keep it, but it's disappointing that the quality of Fisher Price's soothers has actually gotten worse over time rather than better.All in all it is acceptable but it's way too noisy.The noise I'm referring to is the mechanism that runs it not the music.The only sound that is pleasant seems to be the nature sound, the other two are quite annoying.He falls asleep so easily when I put this on for him.I just wish it stayed on longer so I didn't have to come in and do it or fp could make a remote?The soother will only fit above his head in the sleigh back style crib but he doesn't seem to mind.Excellent teether, my baby's fav from 3 mo till 10 mo.Good for front/side, not back teeth.I like that it's PVC/BPA free.However, I took it outside in 86 degree weather to have a picnic with my son and it got crooked(melted from being in the sun!We have only used the spoon so far, but it works well and I feel good knowing that I am not putting harsh chemicals in his mouth with these utensils.I also purchased the bowl and warming plate to go along with them.You are not supposed to put them in the dishwasher or microwave, but that didnt matter to me- you shouldn't put baby food in the mic anyways.I plan to purchase more when he starts eating more too.But, the fork broke in our sink=(  It was crushed (really easly) by a dish.I love the green sprout products and the peace of mind it gives me.I would buy this again.We purchased this set for our 6-month baby (for now we use just a spoon).The spoon is shorter (it is 6 inches) than the ones we used before.It's bpa,pvc and phtalate free.This is a cute little spoon and fork set.I love all of green sprouts products for their pvc free and bpa free.I struggled to find plastic tableware for my toddler that did contain scary chemicals.I don't mind that I can't put this in the dishwasher as all soap by nature is antibacterial.A warm soapy scrub is all it needs and it has never been a problem.That said, of course it would be more convenient to have something you can toss in the dishwasher, but I'm not willing to risk feeding my child on something potentially harmful.My only issue is that it can't be washed in the dishwasher - but, NO big deal.It's big and super durable.I also purchased the utensils and warming plate to go along with them.You are not supposed to put them in the dishwasher or microwave, but that didnt matter to me- you shouldn't put baby food in the mic anyways.I plan to purchase more when he starts eating more too.I usually make cereal in it.It is well made of biodegradable plastic on cornstarch basis.I would definitely buy other things by this company.I like it's eco-friendly, BUT it could have been slightly bigger and it'd have been nice if there was a suction cup on the bottom (to stick on the tray of highchair).I love green sprouts!The best part is that it's free of bpa, pvc and plastic!!I am a first time mother, and have tried disposable nursing pads as well as washable.These ones are by far the worst I have tried!I recommend La Leche washable nursing pads and madella disposable pads.I bought these after not having much luck with the disposables and reading that the material on the disposables aren't good for you.They were organic and the same price as the non-organic material so I went for it and I really like them.They leak but only after I've soaked them with milk.Usually they stay nice and dry.Only gripe was that it comes in a pack of 6 but mine only had 4!I went to the store several times and they were sold out so I haven't been able to buy another pack so I'm going to get them here.With shipping they come to the same price as the store with tax.I bought 3 different types of reusable breast pads and tested out wearing each one during the day.They are soft and don't bunch up.I can't comment on absorbency yet though as it was only a pretest.Cute.Decent size for little hands to hold.It doesn't have a hole at the bottom because it is replaced with a blue temperature sensor where the word HOT turns white if the water is hot.Downside is, the duck doesn't quack.Also the temperature sensor always show HOT even if the water is tepid.Well it's alright for me because I didn't care for the sensor, I just wanted a cute duck.This was very convenient to have when I wasn't sure if the water was too hot for our little one.A nice thing to have at bath time, especially when u are new at the whole baby-bath-thing.Writing could be a little more clear, but it does the job and is handy.Strollers have to be parked away from the attractions, and the harness gave my little one the freedom to walk around and stay in line without having to be carried all the time.I left this at my moms house and she would fold it down to use with the 5 oz Medela bottles.My mom said it was a lifesaver when she had her because she didn't have to hold her to feed her the bottle.Also it is too thin.the fake applique is gorgeous and it looks much more expensive than it is.It is great when accidents happen because of its impermeable cover.I researched many options, and this was a winner considering features, price and Brand quality.After scrolling through dozens of choices, the reviews and look of this one had me clicking "add to cart.I love the contour sides.I love the no slip bottom.I love that it curves in the middle and basically cradles your baby while he/she's being changed.All in all, great quality product!Then two or three weeks later when it still had not shipped out to me I decided to cancel the order and look again.I am so glad I did.It is very soft and I love how the sides are raised so it makes it harder for baby to roll around.It also comes with attachment so you can screw this to your changing table or dresser.I dont think that we will be screwing ours down.Ours doesnt move around at all.So I am not sure if many other covers fit it or how well.This is a great product I tell all my friends and family this is the way to go.This cheap fix gave us peace of mind.Not sure about a smaller bed though.My 9 mo old daughter likes to play with sensory toys that she can manipulate in her little hands.She likes these but prefers the smaller ones out of this lot.Nice set of 4 balls.He loves the big ones, but all will probably be used  one time or another.Solidly built and good quality product.Overall good value.One issue.In the future, there can be some issues when I will use the headboard with standard full size bed frame.I compared the holes on the headboard with the holes on my current generic bed frame (from Costco).The holes do not line up.So probably need some handy-work to put in some spacer wood pieces so headboard can be bolted to the bed frame.This crib is so cute and what a great price.It turns into the toddler bed with no problems and will make a great headboard when our baby gets older.I needed a second crib as baby number 2 is due in a few months.This crib was exactly what I was looking for.I wanted something that would convert to a toddler bed for when our daughter is ready to transition.This crib was easy to assemble and was very affordable.Would definitely purchase this again!We received the crib last night and put it together today.Overall, it wasn't a difficult process at all and didn't take very long.Our little hasnt arrived yet, but once he does we will update to see how it's going.After debating between this crib and a slightly more expensive one, we chose this one.It was easy for one person to put together in about 45 minutes.It looks much more expensive than what we paid.The walnut color is actually pretty dark and matches well with the cherry wood throughout the house.So I have to admit that at first I wanted to get the best of the best, regardless of the price.But then after shopping for what seemed like forever, we came upon this crib at Babies R Us.My husband and I ordered this crib (price was better here than at Babies R Us) and put it together.My daughter is only 3 months old so we will see if it holds up, but so far so good.I love this crib with one caveat:  IT WON'T LET A STEEL-FRAMED CRIB MATTRESS SIT FLAT because it won't squeeze between the brackets that hold the springboard up.Why I chose this crib:(1) After reading reviews on a TON of cribs, the problems reported seemed fewer and less significant or even avoidable.(More reviews for this crib are under the espresso finish.)(2) I chose the natural finish because, like many cribs priced up to $500, it's made of pine, which is by its nature a softer wood, so likely to be dinged by a baby.I figure that with the natural finish, any dings or chips on the finish won't show as badly as on the espresso finish.Also, pine is a light wood that you can kind of mesh with other pine or birch pieces and it looks fine... Darker stains are harder to match.(3) I went to a store with a lot of cribs set up to see how the standard mattress fit in each one and to shake each one for sturdiness.(Granted, even good cribs may seem less sturdy if not tightened properly when built.(5) This is convertible to a toddler bed.The downside is it doesn't have a half-rail, however it's super low to the ground at that stage, so I don't see that it will be a huge problem.I would think that most kids will only fall out a few times before they learn not to roll off.(6) You can also convert it to a full-sized headboard (not the whole frame) which I liked because a lot of other cribs require you to spend around $100 to buy the matching side pieces to put along the bed.And really, kids don't need footboards on their beds, in my opinion.The directions (which are on the spring assembly in the box) were great as long as you really pay attention to where the holes are on the picture to see which way the pieces are facing.I didn't do great at first, but it only added a few minutes to fix the piece I'd turned around.It was easy to assemble, and when you tighten the bolts properly, it is very sturdy.Only problem:I tried to put my nice steel-framed mattress in and saw that where the brackets made it so the mattress wouldn't fit flat.I warily called customer service and was actually very impressed with them--except the replacement springboards they sent, though different, still had the inherent problem of not allowing enough room for the mattress which was the size they said to buy because it won't "squish" in between the brackets.I'm extremely disappointed with this easily avoidable flaw in the design, but otherwise really do like the crib.However, I do overall like this crib, and it's reasonably priced.I'm about to buy my second one for my second child.They are much softer on baby's skin compared to the Trend Lab towels I bought, which are much rougher and did not look good after one wash.  My advice, don't waste your time buying the cheaper towels.These cost more, but it is money well spent.The main issue I have with this cup is that a strong suction is created which sucks the silicon portion into the cup, making it next to impossible to drink.The only way to release the vacuum is to squeeze the spout.Clearly, the release valve does not work well.I'm going to try to cut the release valve open more to see if that will help.But then it will probably leak ...Not only does this cup leak but it also leaks within little nooks and crannies of the plastic.I have only ever put water in the cup and after using it a handful a times, I found mold underneath the actual cupside where it isn't reachable to clean unless you tore off the plastic bottom.YUCK!Threw it away immediately and would never recommend.She is a little short yet so we just put a folded blanket under her feet so she could reach and bounce.I was disappointed only in the fact that it really didn't have any tea pot(s) toys on it.We have an Evenflo Ultrasaucer that she uses at our house and I was tired of breaking it down and setting it back up everytime we visited grandma.It is kinda cheaply made compared to the one we have and my mom had it all but a week and the birthday cake on the top was recalled.I really liked this toy so did my daughter but I decided to take it back to the store.This product does exactly what it is supposed to do.I've been through numerous cups and spent entirely too much money on finding the best sippy cup.They DO NOT leak (with the valve).I've finally discovered hard nipple sippy cups are the ONLY way to purchase cups for a child.Soft nippled cups should be taken off the market!My child chewed through and ruined every one of our soft topped cups.This is a fantastic sippy cup!Easy to screw on lids, valves stay put, neat shape helps little ones hold on to it better.It seriously never leaks!There are only a few things I don't like, but only significant enough to take 1 star off my rating:-The spout gradually angles outward down towards the lid - makes it easy for it to slip out of my daughter's mouth compared to others.-While I love that my daughter can hang on to this due to the shape, when I put a "no-throw" loop on it and she lets it fall, it will hang upside down.If she's in her stroller, the spout touches the wheels/ground - ew.I can see how that might be difficult though, due to its shape.HIGHLY recommend.She likes to chew the waterbugs (which are big enough that they're not a choking hazard) and quickly learned how to put the waterbugs in the net and scoop them up.A great bath toy!My 10 month old loves these "water bugs".He immediately puts one in his mouth (don't worry, it's too big to be a choking hazard), and then picks another one up and splashes it around the bathtub.The net will make this bath toy fun for a long time.None of the pieces hold water, so we won't have a mold problem.my 6 month old  baby loved the water bugs right away.I like that this toy can be kept to be used with the net when baby's older.I was looking forever for a plate that has 3 sections that were not just one big section and TINY other sections and this is PERFECT..she can have her fruit, vegetable, and a meat right there for my daughter.I own 12 of these plates and they go through the dishwasher (top rake) and microwave (very short time is all ive tried so far) and they are not warping or anything.These plates are great for microwaving as they do not have the pictures on them like the Disney and other plates that although marked microwaveable end up bubbling up and chipping over time.Amazon does a poor job with these as they don;t break out the colors (you get random) so buying for a boy the colors they chose for me were pink and purple.These are plastic plates with no pieces.the main reason I purchased this plate is that it is BPA free.I bought 2 two packs, got one that had green and blue and one that had orange and yellow, so I have quite the cute little collection of plates, but you would think they would be designed to stack!I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not like they topple over in my cupboard or anything...they're only 4 high and they're flat, so they do "balance" on top of one another, but it would be so much more convinient (and seemingly quite easy) to design them so that they actually kinda nestle into eachother.We got this at the reccomendation of a Doctor in the PICU.The Wubbanub is the best thing since a bouncy seat.The toy gives him something to hug while sucking his paci,and the added weight of the bear helps keeps the paci in his mouth.And if the Paci drops it will not roll under furniture (Never good to have a screaming baby while parents are on hands and knees surching frantically for the paci).He won't take the other pacifiers I tried.It is just a Soothie, sure...I don't mind hand-washing but air drying takes too long!Would definitely buy again.This is great for keeping the paci from popping out of an infant's mouth and onto the floor - it just stays right there and baby quickly learns to find it again when they want it.The paci will no longer bounce across the floor and hide under furniture!!Oh, and to clean it, I just held the paci part under hot water, washed it with soap, rinsed well, and pop it back in his mouth.When the cuddly-part got dirty, I hand-washed in the sink & air-dry overnight.(good reason to have 2!!)We swaddle them when they are sleeping, put the pacifier in their mouths, and plop the wubbanub on their chest so when they spit out the pacifier, it doesn't go far and it's still there if they decide they want to suck on it again.Once we stopped swaddling them, the fuzzy animal attachment is the perfect size for their little hands to play with.I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.I also use my food processor to make food.I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.I do feel the trays are overpriced.It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad.I would highly recommend this product.Be careful washing it in the dishwasher the plastic top can change its form and after does not cover well.I received this freezer tray along with the Beaba foodmaker and spoons from my in-laws.I am totally told on all Beaba products due to the high quality and great designs.The food pops out easily and leaves no waste behind.I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food.I've found a small Sure LID 4 oz container (a little bigger portion size, but I just don't fill them up all the way).They have an aatached lid and I can just take them out of the freezer and pop into the diaper bag.The attached lid is the real selling point for me.Sure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * 4 Ounce/Half Cup/118mL - 2 Per PackSo, if you or your spouse are on the taller side this is probably not the stroller for you.We just got this cell phone (rated for 6+ months) for our 11 month old son about a week ago.Durability:It has been dropped from heights, thrown across the room, beaten onto the cement outside, and drooled on - a lot.This is a huge thing for us since some toys just seem SO loud.It has a child saying the numbers when the numbers are pressed and has three set sounds for each of the green and red phone buttons.What my child thinks:I know this is still his newest toy but my son seems to like it very much.He gets ahold of my cell phone about half as much since we got this one.He likes dragging it around with him so that must be a five star infant rating!*EDIT* We've had this phone for 3 years now and had to change the batteries recently for the first time.My baby isn't here yet but I'm not that good with my hands and I put it together myself.The instruction booklet was very helpful.So we've had this stroller for almost a month now and we've managed to use it in almost every weather situation here in New York where the sidewalks and malls are always crowded and busy.First let me begin by saying that although I love the stroller I had to take off a star because of the weight.Besides that the stroller travels well on almost all surfaces, except for snow which we've had a lot of recently.It sometimes get stuck when folding and that can also be a problem.Taking it out of the box I fell in love with the Cowmooflage design.It looks rather ugly on the computer but looks really nice after it's assembled which was also a very easy process.Putting the baby in and out of the reclining seat, which reclines in 3 positions, was also a breeze since the snack tray lifts up which was a really great idea.Our last stroller was a Maclaren Techno XT which also worked well in that department.I'd recommend the Britax Chaperone.Don't be discouraged by my 4 stars, it's a great stroller and I'd gladly replace my Maclaren Techno for this.So imagine my excitement to try out the Britax stroller.At first I was taken aback by the cowMOOflage.Not really a fan of that print, but hey, it's a Britax right so I pushed my NYC vanity aside and accepted the cow print.Hey I live across from a corn field now so it's not like I'm in a metro area.Well aesthetics aside, the stroller is sleek in it's design.I thought it maneuvered just OKAY.I can say it handles better than myGraco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller FrameI thought the cupholders were great, but for me not a life and death necessity.I thought it folded up well.Almost a one-handed fold.Maybe with practice and a little luck on your side you can get it with one hand.I still was not thrilled with it's compactness.I think this could be a great stroller for someone who absolutely loves Britax, loves this cowmooflage print and wants to coordinate with the Britax Chaperone Carrier, Cowmooflage.For me my top things were:1) maneuverability-Not there for me.2) Compactness-My Maclaren rolls circles around this one.3) Washability-looking for a stroller I can totally take the fabric off of if the unthinkable happens, which with kids, will happen.I didn't feel this stroller was tops in any of my top three so I will keep searching and use what I got for now.I really like the overall look of this stroller.It does have rubber tires which is a plus compared to many of the strollers out there with plastic wheels.However, this stroller works really well when we are in crowded places and don't want to be stuck with the longer jogging stroller.The stroller features an adjustable handle height which is great for dads.It's a great big stroller not well suited for fitting in a vehicle.But being a great big stroller it's great stroller for tooling about the zoo or long days downtown.It seems like it's going to hold up well.It folds very easily and the extendable handles are great for those of us that are a little taller.The fabric thus far is easy to clean.I'm long past the daily need for a stroller, but I pull this thing out everytime I sense someone is about to fall asleep or will fall asleep during the outing.1.This is the easiest stroller to click-n-go with one hand currently being sold.One would think that the 'Cowmooflage Print' would be an awful choice in fabric pattern, but after I got this it was quickly apparent that his was actually the best color for several reasons.This stroller gets a lot of remarks, ooh's and aah's and people all fancy the cow print when they see it in real life versus in a picture.I got this toy for my son because he likes rattles and I liked that it was eco-friendly.Unfortunately for whatever reason he never really took to it.Maybe it's because the rattle is on the quiet side, maybe it's because the face doesn't have a lot of contrast, or maybe it's because it's a little flat rather than more three dimensional.It was expensive though so hopefully my next baby is more interested in it.Things that a baby toy should be: safe, eco-fiendly, washable, hypo-allergenic and this is organic cotton too.It's a soft rattle, not noisy and annoying (very important for parents!Hope my baby is too!He's 2 months old and wouldn't even take his eyes off it while we were setting it up.The toys and the mat itself is very interactive and it'll be useful for a LONG time!This toy is fantastic.My baby (9 months) squeals and giggles so much when she sees herself in the mirror and rattles it.The squeaker is not very loud, which is good.But it's loud enough to get her attention.She did not cry at all !It has a Velcro in the back so we hook it to highchairs in restaurants.It keeps her occupied long enough for me to have a quick dinner.It's also machine washable.My only complaint is that a baby needs to be a little older to play and understand the toy... also the mirror may scratch/dent easily.Other than that... its really cuteOur little guy loves looking at this cow.It has a little velcro strap on the back so we attach it to his carseat or bouncer chair.He still doesn't do a whole lot with the hanging toys, but he will look at them sometimes, other times we take the toy bar off because he seems to prefer looking at other things.We've also started to swap out the hanging toys now and then.I love the tan and sage tones, it kind of melts into any room it's in - not bright, not hard on the eyes, and doesn't stand out and scream BABY!You only need a screwdriver for the battery compartment.Bought this for my 3rd baby - thus my 3rd bouncer.It is really cute too with the owl motif.Great in helping to keep her Ci-Ci in her mouth with just a little weight to keep it from falling out.It helps if she puts her arm or hand behind its head and a gentle fall out of her mouth is quickly recovered but it doesn't survive a spit out or quick fall out---still great!One less time to reach over to put it in.Soft!This is by far the best purchase I have made.I didn't like the idea of pacifiers since I was EBF and I didn't wanna give her confusion.I gave her Wubby at 3 months and she loves it, no confusion either.We have a total of 4 of them now lol, we have two in her crib and two in the car.She loves to actually snuggle with her wub.For all you breast feeding moms that are looking for a great paci I would highly recommend to get a wubbanub, also I suggest sleeping with it the first two night to get your scent on the wub so it's comforting to the baby :)bought these for my daughter because they were not only adorable but they are GREAT at night because they usually stayed on her chest when the paci fell out.Even if it fell to the side of her, they are so easy to find in the middle of the night when you're half asleep!!!I also have the lion, dog, monkey and caterpillar.He does hold it while sucking on the pacifier.When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.:)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.The kitty cat is very well sewn.I've also tossed it in the washing machine a couple of times (in a mesh bag) and drip dried it.I love this, even though my baby quit using pacifiers, he still hugs his Wubbanub to sleep.I can easily hand wash/hang dry the kitten.it has proven to be very durable.the pacifier is well stitched to the stuffy.I am very pleased with this product.The stuffed animal prevents the pacifier from rolling away, makes it easier for a baby to grasp and manipulate, and helps keep the pacifier in the mouth.CoosBPA, PVC and Phthalate Free.Uses a Soothie which is a medical grade, latex free pacifier.Prevents the pacifier from rolling away from the child (and possibly less screaming from baby).Plushie may help soothe baby due to the way it "cuddles" baby.Plushie allows babies to grasp and manipulate pacifier themselves.Lots of cute animal plushies to choose (Ilana's son had the dog...we think it is really cute).Perfect for a baby with low tone and other mouth issues (Ilana's son was unable to keep a pacifier in his mouth due to weak muscle tone.The Wubbanub allowed him to push the pacifier back in his mouth).Used by NICUs and hospitals.Can be put in the washing machine to clean (...and you will need to).Plushie is secured safely to the pacifier to prevent accidental removal.BoosWhile the Wubbanub can be washed the pacifier can not be sterilized (due to the way it is attached).The only pacifier that is used is the Soothie.If your child already prefers a different kind of pacifier it may be difficult to switch.Due to its plush design, it is not safe for use in the crib per experts (we do not recommend using it in the crib and to use a "plain" Soothie for sleep time).If the baby becomes attached to the animal it may take you longer to wean off the pacifier (Ilana solved this problem by detaching the pacifier with some creative scissor work).Dogs love to eat them (Ilana lost two to her dog...amongst other things).The Petite Consumer says: A "lovey" and a paci combo sounds like a baby's and parent's dream.I bought a Soothie Pacifier holder (the honey pot one) but that item failed us.It's good to the both of us.He was "so over" his paci after only 2 nights and now, he and the monkey are inseparable at bed time.Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has.We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his "wubbas" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable.This is an answer to my prayers.I wish the stuffed animal was a little heavier to stay in place on my babies chest.The soothie paci is sewn to the animal so once it wears out you'll need to buy another one.I thought the stuffed animal clipped onto the paci.This is cute, cute, cute!My youngest two have so many of these.I just put them on the top shelf.When I pulled this out and turned it on the first thing I thought was, "Wow, it's really quiet.As a matter of fact she went pretty nuts on this thing, loved it at first.And though we could barely hear it she seemed pretty happy so we tied it into the crib.Here's the problem.At 7 months my daughter has recently learned to pull herself up and is trying desperately to get out of her crib.We left it on the floor for her to play with and after a few days she got bored with it.My guess is that it's too quiet, even on the loudest settings.I did try replacing the batteries and nothing.Not sure if i got a bad model but with out the feedback it's just not that interesting to her.I'm giving it 3 stars since she really did seem to like it and other reviews don't seem to have my issue.However!If your baby can pull themselves up to standing, I wouldn't recommend this for the crib, could lead to some bumps and bruises.This is a cute and fun toy but I must admit that I seem to enjoy it more than he does.I wish that the setting to create your own song would play just the note and not a short song at the end.The volume could stand to be louder as well.Overall this is a nice source of entertainment for short periods of time.He kicks it constantly in his crib!We don't even use our baby monitor - all he has to do to let us know it's time to wake up is kick his piano!I did not put it on the crib as intended because when I put the babies in there I want them to sleep and they would never sleep with this toy on!(I did try it) Anyway, I have it next to their play mat against the sofa and when I turn it on they will watch it for a few minutes.They also kick it when I put them with their feet up to it.The piano makes a lot of extra noises and tunes in between notes so it's not really obvious that they are playing it.I am hoping once the start sitting up and crawling that I can put it on the floor and they will be interested in it.What a great idea to put on the crib!This caught her attention for a couple days, then it just sat there for a month or two.I went to turn it on the other day and it started playing...then playing..and it wouldn't stop!I wish I didn't waste my money on this.Hopefully the next baby will like it.Most of these things costs $35-$50 at the local k/walmart so this is a bargain in comparison.It doesn't move and the music only stays on for 12 minutes tops.At my house I have the homedics projector which is 100 times better than this one.There is a timer with different time selections on it.This projector can not compete with the homedics projector which also has a choice of 3 different discs.There are also a variety of sounds to choose from.Buying this product was a mistake unfortunately babys r us does not carry the homedics which is why I bought this one for my mothers house.He stares at the image when projected on the ceiling.It often makes him stop crying.It seems to capture his attention well enough.If your baby is still in your room with you, you can put it on your nightstand and turn it on with the push of one button for those middle of the night wakings.There are little feet on the bottom so you can tilt the projector a bit to project the image over the crib/basinette.There are two images that can be projected -- a full reef scene and a simplified one.You can select which one you want to use.The music is the same as the Fisher Price Aquarium Swing, so if you have that already, you might get sick of the songs.It runs on batteries (still using the same ones after 7 months), and is lightweight enough to take on overnight trips.I purchased this a month ago for my infant.He appears to enjoy it alot.The ocean sounds help him fall asleep and are not too loud.On the downside you can not have the light without the music.The projector is supposed to be adjustable, but I think that is misleading.You adjust the projected scene by moving the entire toy, its not a seperate function that alows you to simply change the angle of the projector.Further, I can not determine what the educational difference is between the two settings.This is portable (it has a handle and is light enouch for a child to carry), my nearly five year old daughter loves to take it out of the baby's room and use it for her dolls.The arm swings back and forth which gives the mobile movement, but the hanging mobile itself at the top of the arm does not rotate.It starts doing it and then stops after a few seconds.Plus, there are only 3 figures on it and, since they do not move, they do not really capture my baby's interest.I would recommend going with something else.It is nice because:-it is battery powered-not too expensive-nice creatures and music-interesting movement of the animals - not just a simple circleIssues:-the mechanism makes some sound, which can be quite annoying-there is a snap strap to attach it to the crib, if you have a crib with a rounded profile and a center bar it will be difficult to hang it it properly- if it does not hang properly the animals may not move in the mobile - the white bar only moves to the left and right, the movement of the animals  is  a combination of the bar movement and gravity/different weight of the animals.If the mobile is not perfectly straight ( see comment above) the animals will not move!Your baby can see only a foot away at 1 month and 2 feet at 2 months - You may want to adjust the height the baby growsI have had this pump for about 2 months.The pump works great & definitely better than the Medela pump I have (step below the pump in style).The flanges that come with this are bigger than the standard Medela ones, 27mm & I notice that I get more milk when I use those as opposed to the 24mm breastshields.Love the built in battery, I can pump anywhere regardless of the outlet location.You would not believe how handy that is.I love the 3 year warranty, 3 week money back guaranty, and that this pump can be used by more than one user.The one thing that I don't like is the CARE button, where you can record your baby's cry.I love the idea, but the design of the button is all wrong.So instead of it playing my babies cry, it plays me talking to someone, or the noise of the bag as I walk along.Luckily I don't really need the button for let down, but if this is one of the main reasons you want this pump, rethink.Apparently the company is aware & keeping that in mind for future incarnations.I would have given this pump a 5 star rating, except for the issue with the CARE button.I got the neutral colors so when my husband may need to use it he could without a problem.The only thing it did not mention when I bought it was it is vinyl or plastic which I was looking for cloth or faux suede.Great bag with a good design to meet all your essentials.Very good buy for the price.This diaper bag is pretty small.I am using cloth diapers and I think it will be too small to be convenient.The little cooling bag doesn't appear to be very well insulated.If you are looking for a cheap, smaller diaper bag, this would be fine.Not so hot for cloth diapers, or if you want a larger bag.This bra makes pumping at work so easy for me!I don't wear the bra to work because I find it a little bulky.I keep it in my pump bag and slip it on for my pumping sessions.Since it zips in the front this is no problem at all!It has no problem holding a full 5-6oz in my bottles.I can check my email while I pump which helps me stay relaxed.I recommend this bra to all of my pumping friends!SizingIt's a little weird.I have it adjusted down fairly far, but there is still more room to tighten further if I need to.Inconspicuous?No.The outline of those flange-holding things on the front is very visible through any light to moderate weight shirt.Therefore I take it to work with me and put it on as I begin every pumping session, then take it off when I'm done.ComfortNice.It's soft cotton and doesn't have any annoying tags or rough bits.AdjustabilityVery nice.Front zippers move smoothly and easily.ColorWhy must everything be pink?Why?ConvenienceTHANK GOODNESS FOR THIS BRA!(Although it's line dry only, which is a bit of a pain in the rear.)After researching the different types of hands free pumping bras available, I settled on this one due to the ability to adjust the fit as needed and I am very glad that I did.As I have used it in different times of the day I have been able to adjust the fit to my varying size.This bra has saved me a lot of time as I am now able to multitask and therefore able to have longer pumping sessions as I no longer grow bored and inpatient.I just wish that it was available in other colors besides pink.The older one annoys her when she pumps, and, even if he's not around, my wife loves to multi-task.She found it so easy to put on and adjust.Such a simple concept executed well.Easy to use, I just put it on over my nursing bra when it's time to pump.I wear it without the straps and it doesn't move around on me.I'm glad I bought it.Hands free pumping is so much more comfortable and convenient.I use it at home and at work.Before, I would wake up in the middle of the night to feed the baby and I was super engorged and/or leaking through breast pads.I would have to feed my little one, wait for her to fall asleep so I could put her down, then pump before going back to bed.Now, I can pump and feed her at the same time, which allows me to go back to sleep much quicker!As for the product itself, it is extremely well made, the fabric is amazing, it fits great and is VERY adjustable.I have not washed it yet, but I can tell from the quality of the fabric that it will hold up very well for a LONG time.I definitely recommend this.This bra is great for those who want to pump and have their hands free.This bra also has other features to help adjust size and is designed to securely hold the pumping parts to make pumping truly a hands free process.This product really works.In fact, my Medella breast shields did not fit perfectly and my pump could not drain my breast completely.After using this bra (which by nature has to be snug fit) my breasts drain completely.Just be careful about reading the size information carefully - it can be tricky.I didn't get this right away because of the price, but it's totally worth it.It completely simplified my morning routine.Instead of pumping while looking at the clock all stressed out about the time, I could pump while getting ready.In addition, when developing tendinitis on my wrists (many moms do when the baby starts adding on the pounds), holding the pumps with my hands was very painful because of the angle the wrists have to turn.I had no problem adjusting it to fit.As a testimony of how useful it is, I brought it with me overseas when I went on vacation (baby was 7 months old at the time), and when I misplaced it one day, I ordered a new one from Amazon right away because I simply couldn't live without it.It's very well made and it has a bit of a Victoria's Secret feel - pink, soft... For the ultimate pumping experience buy the Medela FreestyleMedela Freestyle Breast Pump- I could clip the pump to the bra or my clothes and move around and do pretty much anything (short of going out of the house).These two products are a MUST for a working mom - they allow breastfeeding without adding pumping to the never-ending to-do list.I got a S/M and whe I pulled it from the package I thought "now how will this fit me?".I looked again and found an extension pannel inside the box.Great idea!You zip the pannel in the front and it extends the space between holes for the pump.The only thing that is a tad akward is the fully adjustable velcro.You want to adjust it to fit you then put it on.All in all a Great product.I extensively researched all the features of other hands-free pumping bras on the market, and this one is by far the best.All breastfeeding mom's should register for the Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breatpump Bra.This bra makes breast-pumping much less of a task because you are able to get other things done with both hands free!I used the bra while building a supply during maternity leave and now could not live without it while I am pumping at the office.I wish I had put it on my registry.It holds up well and I toss it in with the laundry to keep it clean.I'm a new, first-time mom (our daughter is 6 weeks old), and after a week of holding onto the breastpump parts while pumping, decided it was time to look for something that would let me pump hands-free.The nipple shields stay perfectly in place, and there's enough support to hold onto the bottles I pump into (so far it's taken about 6 oz of weight, I assume there won't be a problem if/when I'm pumping more).I'm very easily able to use the computer or talk on the phone, etc... only limited by the length of the tubing now.I couldn't have asked for a better product!I bought the easy expressions pump bra a few months ago and was disappointed because after doing thorough research on the sizing, it was too tight at times depending on how full I was.Also, there is no way to cover up your nipples, they just hang out even when you're not pumping.I can't believe I missed this bra when I orignally ordered.Additionally, depending on how long you plan to pump, your breast size as well as body weight will adjust over time as well so this ONE bra can accommodate a large range of sizes.The Simple Wishes bra is adjustable from the front and the back... anyone who's used a pump bra can attest to that being important.Also, it covers your nipples and doesn't leave them just exposed all of the time, which is more comfortable should you need to leave the pump bra on and put on a shirt or something.The only positives of the Easy Expressions over this one (that I found anyway) is that the Simples Wishes bra is a little bit itchier due to it being more substantial and the Simple Wishes bra zips from top to bottom which is a little bit strange and difficult to do.Both have some comfort issues and both are pretty much the same price - I would say go with the Simple Wishes one because you'll get more use out of it due it's flexibility in sizing.I couldn't believe it, but this things really does make pumping hands free which makes frequent pumping much more tolerable.I absolutely love this bra.I have to pump regularly for my 2 1/2 month old son, and now I really wish I'd had this bra from day one.I bought this based off other good reviews, and I have not been disappointed.The bra really does hold my bottles of milk securely (I used the Medela PIS electric pump) and when I first started using it the amount of milk I get actually went up!That was a huge surprise, I thought I'd have to pay for the convenience of hands free pumping with LESS milk, but not so.It's fairly comfortable, though still not sure I'd wear the bra out of the house (though I will likely put it on to pump at work).The only problems I had were (1) an issue with the velcro on the two bras I ordered through Amazon and (2) when I first tried to contact Simple Wishes the online submission form didn't work, but once my message did get through (on the 3rd try) their customer service was great and I was able to get the bras replaced quickly -the new ones are perfect.I haven't tried any other brand of hand's free pumping bra, but I'm happy enough with this one that I don't feel the need to try another brand -which is important since I will likely have another child or two, so a lot of time pumping ahead.Now instead of feeling like I "lose" the time spent pumping, all I have to do is take a couple minutes to put on this bra, and then the time flies by while I check email or take care of other business online -and yes, I am wearing it now.:-) If it weren't for this product, I don't know how much longer I could go on pumping milk, but now I expect that even when I go back to long days at work I will still be able to fit in 3 good sessions a day and at least provide my son with some breastmilk on a regular basis.There is a removable part in the middle to make the holes for the pumps farther apart.When I put it in, it's too far apart, when I take it out, it's too close together.I have to pin it together with a safety pin to get it the right adjustment.Other than that, this is a must have for anyone needing to pump.Why sit there for 10-20 mins holding the pumps when you can have your hands free to read or use the computer?I recently ordered this after pumping without one for over 3 months.Why did I wait?!Very easy to use, can wear as a bra if you'd like or just use when pumping.And maybe it is my imagination, but I seem to get a little more when I use this (due to the compression?I don't know how I pumped without it!This hands free adjustable bra is the best, I can't pump comfortably without it now.I haven't tried the regular hands free bra, but I bet that one works well too.This is a better hands free alternative than the clips & straps that come with the Medela Freestyle pump.Don't waste money on that - spend it on bras like this one.I love my Simple Wishes Hands-Free bra.It is truly hands free once adjusted to fit.I love that I can pump while eating, washing bottles/dishes, packing lunches, fixing dinner, working on the computer, etc.This bra has really helped me multitask at work (with the door closed and locked, of course!).It is completely hands-free, so I can type, read files, etc.I have my Medela pump (camouflaged in a backpack) right next to my keyboard, so three times a day I lock my door, strap on the otherworldly-looking bra, and I'm set.Finally, it fits comfortably with no rubbing or annoying edges.All around, this is a great product and I'm so glad I got past its silly looks to give it a try.So glad I purchased it!This is the only pumping bra I've used and it works great with the ameda purely yours.To all the reviewers who said it being awkward to wear at work all day, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?Though they give you the option of wearing it all day it's really not designed for it.I wear a nursing bra to work and when it's time to pump, i snap down the nursing bra and pull up (or unbutton) the shirt I'm wearing and wrap this bra on.I'm fact I'm pumping right now!This thing has saved my sanity.The zipper takes me a little wrestling to get on, but not too bad.Once on, makes my life so much easier.It holds any bottle on very well.In the morning I use big (8 oz) Dr. Brown bottles on my Medela pump and they are very snug.I usually pump 13 ounces in the morning and it holds all that weight very well.This is a great investment if you plan on pumping in the car, at work, or even just want to surf the web while you are pumping.I like the fact that it's adjustable.It also supports the pump well.You can put it over a nursing bra or cami, however it will be too many layers to massage around breast.It's also kind of pricey although it's well made...I used an old cotton bra and cut holes on it, it actually works as well.As a working mom, I put this in my "must have" category and would suggest it to EVERY nursing/pumping mom out there.I bought this based on all of the positive reviews and I was NOT disappointed.I didn't use one with my first child and nursed/pumped for 18 months.What was I thinking?!?!?I could have saved myself a lot of stress and effort.Pros:It is truly HANDS-FREEFits fantastically due to all of the adjustmentsYou can add/remove the strapsHolds pumps securely in one placeDurable enough to hold full nursing bottlesFits in my pump bagCons:Can't really be worn as a regular bra.If you have a tighter fitting shirt, you'd be able to see the outline of the zippers etc underneath.Definitely can't be worn with a low cut shirt because it sits high on your chestWhile I like the light pink color, I'd like it to be available in other colors.Because I can't wear this under my business attire, I just put it in my pump bag and use it when I pump.I wear it while eating my lunch, texting and even napping while leaning forward against the desk.At home, I can pretty much do anything.This is great for hands free pumping!I use it with my Medela double electric breast pump and it's so nice to finally be able to do things with my hands while I pump!No need to invest in a hands free pump if you buy this bra.Only way it could be better is if it were available in black.I super love this hands free bra.I use it every day.Since I only pump for my baby it is especially useful to me.I didn't use this much at home, but now I am back to work it helps me pump both sides fast and hands free!I have the medela freestyle pump and it works very well with this bra.I love my Simple Wishes pumping bra.I use it about 5 times a day with my Medela Pump and Go Advanced pump.It's easy to put on and it fits snugly; I'm not afraid of my pump losing it's suction.I can wear it to pump and get other things done at the same time, like putting on my makeup, styling my hair and surf the internet on my phone when it gets agonizingly boring from pumping!I wish it was more "undergarmet friendly" so that I could wear it under my normal work clothes.I did finally find one that worked pretty well, but I was required to take off my shirt in order to put on the pumping bra each time I pumped, three times a day at work.Not only did I feel a bit more exposed, but I often got deodorant marks on my shirt while taking it on/off several times a day, messed up my hair, got chilly from having bare shoulders and arms, and wasted more of my precious pumping time by needing to half undress and re-dress each time.Then I came across this wonderful hands-free bustier-style pump bra from Simple Wishes, and I LOVE IT!I can also attest to it being able to hold two full collection bottles as I had no issues when it was supporting two 5-ounce bottles that were nearly full, and still was able to have full use of both hands.It is an overall well thought-out, well-made pump bra/bustier, and even if you are on a very tight budget, this is well worth the price.This is the best nursing contraption I've ever encountered!I was too cheap to buy this with my first child and managed to pump for a year at work by either holding the flanges or jerry-rigging hands-free contraptions with rubber bands.With my second child, I decided I needed to be able to get more work done while pumping and bought this product.Wow.forget you're pumping.This bra cut my pumping time in half!And that's a lot when I work full time and want to keep my baby on breastmilk only.It gets hot in the stroller so it is a good purchase.I purchased this handy little fan for the purpose of clipping it to my daughter's stroller when we're outside.However, I have used it on MANY occasions- including clipping it in the back of my SUV to change a diaper in the back without sweating!I also use it for other times we've had to wait in the car (saves gas to use this rather than run the car).Great product!Even quality batteries don't last as long as I thought they would.- The fan blades quickly get bent out of shape and/or torn if you throw this in a purse or diaper bag.I recommend looking around your local stores before purchasing this item.This fan is just "ok."  The lights on the center of the fan have already stopped working (within two weeks of receiving the fan), and the covering on the stem of the fan has crunched up so it is not completely covered.Fortunately the fan blades are soft, because my child likes to grab the blades.Saved the day for my infant!He would stop the blades with his fingers, face, etc and it didn't hurt.We have used it extensively since - travel, walks, softball games, etc.However, my now 16-month old ripped the foam blades off :-( I need to buy a new one!This looks very nice in person.It's very solid, with money in there it's actually getting pretty heavy.I recieved my personalization, you have to pay about $7 to get the name and an icon sent to you, but it came quickly and I had no problems adhering it.Walnut stain stinks really bad.Stunk up baby's room.Put crib in garage, but his room still smelled after an entire week.So strong, I wouldn't think about letting him sleep in there.Yuck!Aren't these cribs so suppose to be non-toxic/eco-friendly?Not sure about the other finishes, but the Walnut was no good.They're cute, work fine, and I don't think bulk is a problem.The only current problem is that the velcro tabs don't want to stay back, so I get a diaper chain pretty often.Another problem I had was my pack (that I bought from another seller, and not Amazon) was the missing washcloths.The pack said it came with 2 washcloths, but mine didn't.Not a big enough deal to me to put up a fuss because I have plenty of washcloths, and I still saved money.I just don't like that I paid for the pack, and it's missing something.After doing more research and reading other reviews, I just wish that I tried Fuzzibunz or some of the other brands.)Saving money getting the Kushies is great if you actually save money.If they don't last (like many reviews I read said), then you don't save money in the long run.Just get the ones with better reviews and you'll probably be much happier that you did.I use them with both AIO and prefolds.I've used one wet bag for two days of diapers on an overnight trip.If you close the bag tightly, no smell!I wash them in the diaper load, and they air dry super fast.I've also used these for soiled clothes and wet swimsuits.I'm not sure the "large" description is what I would describe as large but...it does the job.I am currently using one in the diaper bag for dirty diapers and clothes.I use the other one for sippy cups and ice packs to keep them cold.I never made formula ahead of time because it was always easier to use the pre-measured formula and bottled water.When my daughter started drinking juice and milk, I needed a way to keep it cold.I didn't want to spend the money on a bottle cooler, so this works very well, without condensation wetting everything in her bag.I have also used the bags to keep things dry on a camping trip (without baby).They kept cell phones and other essentials dry when the bottom of the canoe filled with water.To be honest, if they were much bigger they wouldn't be as handy - I can fit these in my regular purse.I have been putting two diapers and some wipes in the bag when I go places...then when I change my son's diaper, I just take them out and replace with the dirty one (or two if I have to  change him again).I have also used them to bring a wet bathing suit home and the bags have not leaked.just a nylon bag without a zipper.Could have done the same job with a zipploc bag.does not hold in smell and just a waste of my money.Too much trouble to ship back.don't recomment it to anyone.These are fine for a quick trip to the store, as they really only hold one or two large diapers.I bought these because the customer reviews indicated they did the job well, and this particular offering is basically two bags for the price of one.Even though they are draw string, odor and moisture was well contained for a day long outing.I use prefolds with a cover and could fit about 4 diapers in one bag.I use a small diaper bag, and appreciate that these bags fold up to a 2in x2in size and I can hide them away until I need one.I just bought another 2-pack because we're out and about every day, and also because I can see many future uses for these lightweight, durable, waterproof bags (i.e.pool toys, bathing suits, to keep soiled clothes separate from other items etc).I have found after using them for awhile now that they don't seem to be holding up very well.The draw strings are really hard to close and the material seems to be disintegrating.I rarely cloth diaper away from home, but when I do, these things are a lifesaver.I have been using these for about a month now, and I like them.They are not very big, but if I had a long outing, I would take both bags.They seem to keep smell in; although I have not had to put a dirty in them yet.The drawstring is good.For the most part keeps the odor trapped and they have a cool design.Easy and dry.these bags are nice, I think they will hold in wet or smelly items without a problem.The only issue I have and the sole reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is I'm not sure of who's description of Large,but these are far from large bags.THey should hold 3-4 diapers I think.Otherwise no problem and this is still a great product!I got this for my baby when he was probably 8 weeks.The movement and bright colors really motivated him to swat at the toys.He loves the movement and could just stare at it for a good while.I think it was a deal... for $56 you get a play gym with sound AND movement.But it's also really well made.This is a win from every angle.This is very cute and has great attachments.That said, the battery operated spinner is kind of weird.The attachment is also heavy and tends to slide down too.My baby likes to chew on the rocket and the monkey, and there are lots of places to hang toys.If you're looking for a reasonably priced Waldorf-type teether (these are JUST as good quality as the super expensive Waldorf teethers I've seen) - buy this.Our baby isn't here yet, but we're thrilled with this purchase so far.It was delivered via Fedex in one 54 lb.The ottoman came fully assembled, so all we had to do was screw on the back, arms, and put the cusions on the chair.We were hesitant to purchase this without having seen it in person, but we read all of the reviews on Amazon and other sites, and the price was right, so we went for it.It glides smoothly and silently!We luckily haven't encountered any of the squeaking that other reviewers have mentioned.Storkcraft Tuscany Glider in Espresso and CreamProduct arrived in 4 days.My husband assembled this chair in 10 minutes.The ottoman came put together and the chair required assembly of the back and arms only.The chair and ottoman fabric is soft.I am looking forward to using this product with my baby.I bought this chair after comparing all of the ratings on Amazon and sitting in all of the chairs at Babies R Us and Target.The high reviews and the very reasonable price point led me to select this one, and it arrived quickly at my door.The box is a little large and unwieldy (and rather heavy, at 50+ pounds) but I managed to wrestle it up a couple of steps and through the door.It was very well packed and nothing was damaged in shipping.I was glad to see that both "rocker" components (the chair base and ottoman) came pre-assembled.The only additional assembly is attaching the arms and back, and attaching the cushions.I was pleasantly surprised to learn that the arm cushions can be easily removed (they snap on/off) which will make cleaning much easier.The back cushion has ties, and the bottom seat cushion is not attached.The chair glides smoothly and the pockets on both arms are very convenient.I often come into the room to find someone else (or one of the cats) sitting in the chair!It is a very pretty green microfiber, but it seems to wear very quickly on the seat (and possibly the arms).I can see wrinkles in it, and I think it would have been a little bit longer-lasting if the bottom seat cushion had been thicker (better padded) or the fabric itself were thicker.The cushion could be re-covered, though, so this is only a cosmetic issue.Overall, very impressed.I would highly recommend this chair.We got the espresso/cream glider and could not be happier!I am 8 months pregnant and my husband was at work when UPS dropped it off, and I put it together all by myself in about 15 minutes!!This glider was one of the less expensive ones I have found.It had a good rating on Amazon so I decided to go with it.Baby hasn't arrived yet but I find myself going in the nursery just to sit in this glider and rock.I recommend it.However, the production quality is a bit lacking, at least on one side!The left arm is missing the holes to put in the screws.You can see where they holes *should* be, but they weren't drilled in the factory.We've left it as is for now, because it isn't worth putting it back in the absolutely gigantic box that the glider arrives in and bothering with a return - the box is seriously huge.Also we don't have a power drill and I'm afraid that if we drill our own holes the wood might crack.I'm a bit disappointed from the production quality side, but I guess defects happen.Also, the price was right, and it was really convenient having it delivered rather than toting it home from Babies R Us or some other store.Otherwise it's pretty comfortable with an extra little pillow in the back for my lower back and time will tell how our baby likes it!This chair is very easy to put together and for the price, its pretty decent.I have had it for about a month and my husband and I both sit in it daily and so far we have not had a "squeek" problem.It has a high back which is nice but it does not recline far enough back for a non-reclining chair.Since it arrived, this chair has had a problem with squeaking.Besides just squeaking, it has other major issues.I have tightened them myself as tight as I possibly can with the appropriate tools, and so has my husband.After about 20-30 days they fall off again.Those parts are small enough for a baby to swallow and I routinely find them on the floor in the baby's room.This chair is just poorly made as far as the squeaking (which is loud and wakes the baby during rocking), and with parts falling off of it.I did not want to pay postage to return this chair.It's only positive points are that it is comfortable as far as padding and the side pockets are nice.I am 5'10" and 160lbs, so I doubt my weight is breaking the chair or making it squeak.The squeaking can temporarily be stopped with WD-40, but I must apply it every 3-4 days otherwise the squeak comes back.I am highly disappointed with the overall quality of the chair we received.It's very comfortable and I nurse her in it for her night and morning feedings.The padded arms are a nice feature.I didn't really need the ottoman, but most gliders at this price are sold as a set.I do end up using it at times.The only thing I wish it could do was recline, but none of the gliders in this price range recline.All the bolts go into nuts inside the wood so there are no screws going into bare wood.This crib is a very good value for the money and I would recommend it to anyone.Great product- easily handles a bunch of plastic bottles and can also hold tall glass bottles...Though I've never filled the entire thing with glass.Only con i can think of is it could take up less room on the counter or be easier to compactly store it when not in use, otherwise very satisfied.I like the reservoir feature so that water doesn't accumulate around the bottlesI wished I would have known about this product sooner!I read a lot of reviews before I decided on this one, definitely one of the best ones out there!It is extremely sturdy (I only use Born Free glass bottles), doesn't tip over if loaded with stuff, and it holds a lot of my breast pump gear as well.The fact that it's cute is a plus.Money well spent!I just got this drying rack, which looks great and is easy to assemble.I will add to the review once I use it, but the main concern I had was water accumulation that folks complained about in the Skip Hop drying rack (which costs twice as much) doesn't seem to be a problem here since the top portion easily comes off from the bottom tray which can then be emptied out easily.Also, you can adjust the green parts that hold the bottles making more or less space between them as you may need.This is the cheapest price on Amazon, can't find anything cheaper anywhere else.I think I summed it all up in the title of this review.We live in a super small apartment with a super small kitchen that is severely lacking in counter space, but I manage to have room for this.It does hold a lot of stuff, including large (even really wide) glass bottles and the pieces of my breast pump.I like that it also has plenty of room on the bottom for things that won't slide onto the arms like flat bottle lids and one piece of my pump that just can't be dried that way.I also like how it collects the water instead of having to drain into the sink.I use it to store my bottle brush.(don't bother with a normal one though anyway.. just get the Phillips Avent bottle brush.. its cleaner and works better.However, it's nearly impossible to turn with one hand, which isn't that efficient when you've got the other hand rinsing the bottle under the faucet.Also, you have to remove the upper portion in order to drain the thing, which is cumbersome.It is also easy to clean since it assembles and disassembles in seconds.I have Dr. Brown bottles (both plastic and glass).This drying rack has been such a HUGE help!!!I have a small kitchen and this takes up barely any space and it looks cute!Holds breast pump parts, bottles well.The bottom tray catches water without overflowing too easily and emptying it is simple.i have 2-3 8oz glass bottles  on it at any one time, plus 3-4 plastic ones, plus bottle rings, breast pump shields etc.wife was skeptic about it when i shown it to her, now she wants me to buy 1 more!1 for home, 1 at in-law's home.I received this bottle tote quickly when ordered, and had come in handy on several occasions already when out shopping or just out for the day.Its well made and the bottle stays cool for hours.A very handy item to keep on hand.I wanted a single bottle holder that would keep a bottle cold for a decent amount of time.The ice packs keep a bottle cooler for longer than some of the alternatives on the market.It's also very trim so it doesn't take up much room in your diaper bag.It also has a snap thing so you can attach it to a stroller or something if you want to.I don't find that particularly useful but it's certainly not a con.You can put just the ice packs or the entire thing in the freezer.I love using this to keep my pumped breast milk cool for my baby when I go on short errands.It doesn't take up much room (HUGE plus since my diaper bag is already packed full) and it keeps my milk COLD (not just cool) even when it's really hot out.It's much better than the Platex one.You can put the whole thing in the freezer or just the ice packs so it is convenient for any situation.Also, the snap is really strong so I can snap it to my diaper bag or to the stroller and I never worry about losing it.We use the bottles with the drop in plastic liners so the milk doesn't actually touch the bottle (because the milk is in the plastic liner inside the bottle).I was worried that this would prevent the liquid from cooling but it doesn't!This bottle holder is insulated so well that it cools the milk even in the liner.This bag is a lifesaver for mothers pumping milk at work.When I get to the office in the morning, I put the two freezer packs in the freezer in the break room.As I pump milk throughout the day, I store the containers in the bag in the shared refrigerator in the break room.The bag looks just like a lunch bag, so nobody has to know what I'm storing in the refrigerator.At the end of the day, I slip the (now frozen) freezer packs into the bag and take the whole thing home with me.The freezer packs keep the milk cold for hours, which is a really nice benefit.I usually dump everything by the back door and only get around to moving the milk into the refrigerator hours later.This bottle bag seemed very well made.The main inside pocket keeps things cold for several hours, but I've never gotten 13 hours out of it like Munchkin claims.The picture shows spoons but if you actually put your spoons in like that they would fall out.After about 1 months use a hole somehow formed in the seam of the front ice pack and oozed gel all over.I really liked the idea behind this with lights and fountain show in the bath.Uh, in reality, not so much!The only show my daughter got was me fighting with this dang thing.First of all, the screws in the back are ridiculously small and impossible to get off.It's not only the size but actually that you have work with gravity to try to get the loose screws and battery compartment lid off.I gave up after the first few hours, returned to it again another day, and again another day, and finally got it open like a month later, for real.No fountain.It was a complete dud.I contacted the company and they wanted me to give them the product number.Of course, at that point, this toy was buriend in a giant toy box.I finally found it again and will get in touch with Munchkin but save yourself the money, trouble and call to customer service.Don't buy.I have had two large stationary mirrors and love them.Can see her well and doesn't move the way I worried when I first installed.Keeping it but not sure that I would buy another.This does what it is made to do!I love, love, love these mirrors.I was worried about buying a mirror for the backseat because I had read about how kids have been injured in car accidents by mirrors and other items in the backseat.The mirror is very clear, I can even see what baby is doing when its pretty dark outside.I thought this was really cute, and I thought this was going to help my toddler get more comfortable with the shower - NOT.It takes some work to pump (no way a toddler could do it) and then the amount of water that comes out is negligible.My toddler did not like it and did not want it in the bath at all.I do not think there is a problem with this particular product, I think they probably all work like this.The idea is much better than what the product actually is.Don't waste your money.i love this high chair!its so small that it fits so easily at the bottom of my diaper bag so i always have it in case i am in a situation where there is no standard high chair available (a friend's home) or if the high chair available doesn't seem sanitary to me (at many restaurants).My daughter loves sitting up like a big girl so this chair is a hit!It is also so easy to clean as its totally washable.Wow what a great product.My 9 month old did not mind sitting in it through dinner, and he was really secure.It washed up easily, air dry, and looks like new!It is so cute!!The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the light green has a few blueish-green smears...maybe from a marker or pen...I'm not sure, but its pretty noticeable.Some people have complained about the smell of chemicals on the couch.The one I ordered had just a hint of smell on it.Still a very good investment and still has a few years of use left in it.Also, I forgot to mention the side pockets before.They are very helpful.I am unable to use this product as the babylock seams started to fall apart after I wash it according to the washing guideline.Customer service from Luna Mattress responded that they will send me a replacement, that was 7 months ago, and nothing happened.I am still trying to contact them to resolve this issue.I think the product can be better, considering it is Made in USA.!I researched several strollers as I needed many different types of features: a huge canopy, a multi-position reclining seat, a rain cover, easily maneuverable, suspensions...you name it, i needed it.I went to several stores to test out the strollers but nothing came close to this one.Many lacked suspension or a proper canopy, for example, a common problem.Usually the brake furthest from the foot brake is a bit flimsy.)Nevertheless, these are minor issues and I still recommend it over ALL other strollers!I love the fact that they included the sun and rain covers....It seems silly to not include these with all strollers as a standard feature.Its weight of 17 lbs is not a big deal since you're just gonna unload it into a car, etc.I chose this model because of its features and styling (I chose Olive which is a really pretty green) and the good reviews here.I am generally happy with the stroller except for a few things, which I think are important issues and responsible for the 3 star rating.CONS-Maneuverability: I find that once my child is in the stroller, along with a diaper bag strapped to the handles, it does not maneuver well and I find myself bumping into things in tight spaces like inside of stores.It lumbers and tends to favor one side (not due to uneven weight distribution).It's pretty impossible to maneuver the stroller one handed although I'm not sure if one can with any lightweight stroller.-Walking: I am only 5'3" and I occasionally kick the wheels while pushing the stroller.Because of this, I tend to hunch more than I should while using it to keep it away from me.The handles seem tall enough though so I think it might be the distance of the rear wheels that's the issue.-The storage space beneath is ok- not awful but not that great either.PROS-Relatively lightweight and compact for storing in the car trunk.-Generally easy to fold and open.-Sunshade!My child can be out in the rain or sun and be fine in it.*Just a side note, I ordered this through my credit card rewards program but it was fulfilled by Amazon.com.EDIT:  I bumped up the stars to 4.I ended up putting the liquid silicone product that another reviewer suggested in the wheel wells and it made a huge difference in the maneuverability.After looking at the Blink and Joovy Kooper, we came upon this stroller by accident.Our son had outgrown his infant stroller, and our peg perego is so heavy.We love the peg perego because they handle so well with toddlers up to 55 lbs, and will be keeping it as our second stroller.It folds so compactly, comes with so many extras, and is a good buy for the price.The Twist is easier to push than our peg perego, and comes with so much more than the Maclaren.The bag that attaches to the stroller that has both the rain sheild and UV shade is so convenient.The winter bag just snaps right onto the stroller and is big enough for our toddler.We nearly bought a Maclaren and I am glad we chose this instead.This is an excellent value stroller and comes with various accessories that are so great--foot muff for cold weather, rain cover, sun cover, has a bag hanging int he back as well as a basket in the bottom.The sun cover is phenomenal.I can't recommend it enough.I didn't get to look at the book in the store, but I put it on my registry.The pages are removeable.Several page topics include: mommy, daddy, how we met, coming home, a family tree and other pages up to include their 5th birthday.It's wonderful to just sit down when you get a minute and breeze thru the book and add a picture or notes as you reminise on how your baby has grown in only a few weeks/months.I do wish there was a page for Christening, but I used one of the blank pages in the back to put his invitation and photo.I highly recommend this product and the company.Foot print is easy, although I wish the cover page would show both feet.We use this bib for our 9 month old.I enjoy this bib because it's more pliable than the Bjorn bibs.It rolls easier for stuffing into a diaper bag plus it's much cheaper.I own both brands and this one is just as easy to clean.I really like this bib.It's a softer plastic material, so you don't have to worry about the hard edges like other bibs of this style.It fits her perfectly when she's in her high chair.We might have a problem once she gets older.It's very easy to clean, and I've even washed it on the top shelf of my dishwasher.My only complaint is how it was shipped to me.Like other reviewers, I found it was covered in a dark, oily substance.When I took the bib out of the box, I noticed it was on all my other items and my hands and that it had even leaked through the box.Gross!We've had this bib for about a month now *(SEE UPDATES BELOW)* and I'm pretty happy with it overall.It came loose in the box (along with other items I ordered from Amazon) and it was terribly dirty and a little scratched up.The dirt washed off but I was also disappointed that in person the bib has a seam across the middle that doesn't show up in the product pictures.We have a similar firm plastic bib from Ikea with a pocket that we love but wanted something to keep in the diaper bag.I've bought a cheap plastic bib with a pocket too with a picture of Elmo painted on it, but the paint on Elmo's face started coming off after being washed (by hand) a few times!Yuck!This is one piece of plastic (or silicone?not sure) with no paint or design that will wear off.The plastic is probably about 2 or 3 millimeters thick.I can see why other reviewers didn't like the length, it is a little short but seems to work out perfectly for us.We just got back from a week long vacation where this was the only bib we brought with us.Truly, it is the only bib we need!You can just towel it dry or shake off the water.***UPDATE*** We've bought a green Bibbity for our son that stays with the diaper bag and the blue one stays at home.All we have to do most of the time is rinse it with soap and water, unless there is something sticky or tomato based (which will stain), then you have to scrub a bit.Hope they keep the cost low because this is a great product!!!My 2 1/2 yr old still wears them too.Not sure if it's from the packaging or what.We had another bib with a catch tray that was pretty rigid and couldn't be located at the last minute, so out to the store I went and this was the closest thing I could find.It worked great for the trip as it rolls up into the catch tray and is very easy to tuck away in a purse or diaper bag.Also, it needs no washing on the go, can be rinsed or even wiped out with a napkin and you are on your way.I don't think I need to say any more than only half of what was on his spoon ever made it to his mouth.The other half... ended up in the bib, instead of on his clothes or the floor or me.He even learned that when his bowl was empty, he could go to the bib to get a few more bites.I was surprised to find how disfunctional this bib is after reading all these reviews and purchasing.On top of that, when he moves forward in his highchair it presses on his tray and is really useless.We're going to try a different kind.Best bib in the market - hands down!This bib is fabulous, as the pocket is stiff and stays open to catch wet baby food, and there is no dry-time: just rinse it off and use it again.For our toddler, we useBumkins Waterproof SuperBib, Flutterin various patterns.The Bibbity is too small to adequately protect a toddler's chest, and the neck becomes too small after about 15 mo of age, in our experience.The only reason we stopped using Bibbities is that they are too small for toddlers.changes in the room.It depends on where you place the egg.I didn't really need this but It was cute and I liked that it doubled as a night light.The only thing I wish it did more was tell time!I LOVE this, even though I wonder if the temperature reading is correct.The fabric, fit and finish are very high quality.!We returned these.I was shopping for a booster seat for my 5-yr-old (45" and 41 lbs) who had outgrown her Evenflo Generations seat.At first, I was figuring on buying a Graco Turbobooster or the like, but then I actually felt them in-store and I just didn't want to put my child in something so flimsy, especially when there was the Britax Parkway nearby!ProsThe headwings on the Parkway are so sturdy and so well designed - they keep my daughter's head up when she falls asleep on long trips.I really like that it has side-impact protection (something a backless booster, such as her Evenflo Amp that we only use when we fly and don't want to lug a bigger seat, just can't compete with).Since she was previously harnessed (and is still harnessed in the Britax Frontier we have in my husband's car), she doesn't at all mind the slide guard between her legs.She also likes the "magic" cupholders that can be retracted into the bottom of the seat.ConsUsability.The belts get twisted up easily, the seat belt clasp always seems to be difficult to reach (even when there is an empty seat next to it - which is not always the case), the armrests are so low, that when my dad puts her in - he sometimes runs the seat belt over them.After I assist my daughter in getting belted in, I pull the bottom belt snug (it has to be loose when securing the slide guard, and getting it snug after it's latched is not an easy task with the low armrests) and then take up the slack in the top belt in order to get a secure fit.I am very glad that I purchased a Frontier for my husband's car - as he is less detail oriented and would likely have our daughter improperly secured in her Parkway.I live in the tropics so these blankets come in handy sometimes when the temperature is really hot but you still need to use the blanket to protect the baby from surfaces.They are quite thin as previously discussed but good for the price and has many uses.These are very small and thin, they suit better as either burp cloths or just to put under my baby's head in a swing.There were a few to choose from Amazon and i happened to picked this as the price of another set i picked shot up overnight.I find the material ok.I had worried if it'll turn out small but its ok. my bb sleeps on them during afternoon naps.really handy to have thin and light blankets to carry about.many usages, to place baby on or to cover the car seat when its not in use, etc.Substitute the boring muslin cloth uses with these nice colored prints.These are ok for a new born theyy are small and thin.But they're priced cheap.Perfect, very useful product, The designs are girly but modern, I love the cupcake pattern!This receiving blankets are not for a city like mine (Bogota).I put this on my registry more out of curiosity than anything else and I am very glad that I did.This blanket appears thin, but has just enough weight to it to keep my newborn daughter warm and big enough to keep her swaddled.She is now about 7 weeks old and seems to be able to kick and poke her way out of other receiving blankets when swaddled, but not this one.The fabric is stretchy so it moves with her when she is her most fussy self!I have to admit, I was sucked in by the pretty colors on this mobile.When I received it, I had no trouble at all putting everything together.You can hear the mechanism a bit as it spins, but the little rings on each arm clack as it goes around, and that is a little more distracting.It's not awful, though.The biggest con to this is the fact that it's a huge battery killer.We use rechargeable batteries in it and after about two operations, it's dead.I can't figure out if it's our fault or not, but I've never gotten it to last past a few 10-minute sessions before charging the batteries again.I just wish it would go longer before the batteries run out.My 10 week old daughter LOVES this mobile.She can stare at it and keep herself occupied for 20 minutes, which is 20 minutes more I have to myself!The music can get a little annoying, but it has two volume settings so you can set it to low so only your baby can hear it.Looking forward to using the nightlight option when we finally get our baby to sleep in her own crib.My baby adores this mobile - she gets super excited when it runs, and it completely holds her attention long enough for me to get in a meal or quick nap.The different volume options are a bit limited - quiet (which does conflict a bit with the noise of the motor) and loud (which isn't too loud, but a decent volume for when she wants to be entertained - not for falling asleep to).I love this product, it is the best gift we have received.It is gender neutral.You will get good battery life with a proper battery like Duracell, ours have been running for two months now.The best side for me is that you can mute the mobile.But he was indifferent to it from the start and remains indifferent to it at 4 months old.So we do not use it much, it continues to hang over his bed mostly for decoration, but is mostly unused.Instead my son absolutely loves "Manhattan Toy Infant Stim-Mobile", so I would recommend that one insteadHe is three months old now and this has been going on for the past five weeks.They said it would be more interesting to the baby and BOY they were right.He is VERY interested in it.So much so that we found that when it is nap time we have to remove the top part of it and cover up the base with a white burp cloth.Luckily the top piece snaps on and off with ease and covering up the base is also an easy fix.Good: Very entertaining for baby.Bad: The batteries wear out very quickly.When the music stops and the mobile stops moving a tired mom or dad can easily forget to switch the power off on the mobile.That leads to a lot of battery changing.Maybe the next generation of this product will be better in this sense.This mobile is cute, and my daughter likes it.But it eats up batteries like crazy.It also doesn't fit on my convertible crib, which means I've had to rig it on there with velcro.Also, when the music is on the "high" setting, it's tinny and REALLY loud.I never use it on that setting because it's just too loud and annoying.We have a Fischer Price Soother, which doesn't go through batteries as quickly and DOES attach to our convertible crib.I wish I would have just gone with the soother and not spent money on this mobile.My 3 month old daughter absolutely adores this mobile - it is her most favorite toy and she spends the most time with this mobile in any given day.We've run it every single day for an average of 40 min/day for the past 2 months and are still on the same batteries we first inserted.Just get good quality batteries like Duracell.The rotation movement of individual petals captures my daughters attention and she has never tired of it.She coos and 'talks' to the animals.We also have the Fisher Price rainforest mobile and she does not adore it half as much as she does this one and I suspect it is the pleasant colors and sound and cute looking animal friends in this one.This mobile is really cute!Very cute playmat.She also loves to look at the pretty baby in the mirror.The music is a little annoying...my husband hates it but I can tolerate it.It is also a little pricey considering some of the competition at this price point has a few more bells and whistles.My daughter has used this since I brought her home from the hospital.She loves all of the hanging toys, the mirror and the music that plays when she kicks the foot bad.This has been the second most essential purchase I made (besides the swing).The only thing it is missing is a tummy time pillow.I might look for that in a play mat next time instead of purchasing them separately.I'm giving the star to the idea of attaching this toy to multiple baby gear.That can be useful, however I cannot say that the toy was attached well in any of the items we tried (high chair, car seat, swing).It never got detached, but when baby pulled any of the toys the arch would bend toward his face.I also think it is overstimulatig.Our sweet boy who rarely cries got so frustrated with this toy!The  most he could take of this was 10 min, then he'd start batting angrily at the toys and cry in frustration.He was able to spin the propeller- not a problem- but he caught his fingers in the spinning blades a few times and wasn't happy about it.The musical box has 3 tunes - about 3 seconds each.The first week only one of them would play (pop goes the weasel) and I got so sick of it.I wrote to Tiny Love about the problem and they never replied.Now for some reason, I get to hear the other two tunes, but the "weasel" is the one that we hear most of the time.This toy made me forever switch away from cheap Chinese imports to quality toys from Haba, Selecta, and the like.wooden toys stained not painted, and finished with natural beeswax).Amazon carries quite a few of these toys for very reasonable prices.They are also more educational because they are simpler so allow the baby to use his imagination in using them.Toys with sounds and lights are no more educational than a TV.not interested in it at all (my 4mo old that is).Also supposed to play two tunes and I could only get it to play oneshe would scream and scream to the point that I just never left the house.Then I got this toy arch and ever since she doesnt make a peep unless its laughs and giggles while playing with this thing.I like it because I can put it on her stroller, or another car seat when she out grows her infant one.It is musical but its actually kinda nice, not annoying sounds.It was great to watch her figure out that if she pulled the handle, the spinner would spin.That is her favorite.Just took a 8 hour drive from Northern Cali to Southern Cali and couldnt have done it sane without it!It scared him the first time, it's a little loud!He wants to put it in his mouth more than look at himself though!The hanging strawberry is the best!Disappointed in how it mounts.Buy something more stable!We got this to use in the car but have actually used it almost every day on his bouncer.The toy bar that came with his bouncer has nothing on this toy bar!It keeps him entertained for quite some time, which is a life saver when you're trying to cook dinner or eat a quick breakfast.Love this toy bar and have recommended it to friends.She is not scared of it and tells me its her potty.I did order the potty a few months before we started with any sort of introducing potty training so she would get use to the site of it.It was a slow month of touching it and calling it the "potty" but i am glad we spent the slow time getting her acquainted to it as she has taken to it.The seat is squishy and seems comfy for her.The tray is very easy to remove and dump into the toilet.Everything can be taken apart to be washed, so it is very helpful.I did not want a potty with a lid and glad I got this one as she cannot hide toys in there :)As it is hard to tell from picture, the colored appendages you see on the sides are not hooks, rather they are simply little flat tags (two layers sewn together--not thick).On the plus side, the white cloth is very soft (the tags on the sides are a bit rougher material).The wicker is thin and cheap.It came broken in, luckily the damage where the hole was was on the backside.We just kept it because we didn't want to spend the time returning it.Came lightning fast with free shipping...Love the Sage Green Color .... very Good Quality!There is no "handle" or any means to carry it other than picking it up from the bottom.A ridge around the top would be most helpful so that it can be carried to the laundry area.Only complaint would be that when it times out, it completely cuts off abruptly, doesn't fade out like others.This is a fabulous product.I only wish I'd bought a couple so I don't have to move it from the car seat to the swing, etc .The white noise puts my daughter to sleep immediately.What I have noticed about the "on the go" size products is that their buttons are on the side, which is very convenient.The regular Sleep Sheep has the buttons on the back, which are very hard to reach, especially if it is strapped to the crib or a swing.For that reason alone, I recommend purchasing the on-the-go size.You cannot go wrong buying this product.My daughter really enjoys looking at these little blocks but she is not coordinated enough to pick them up yet.I am sure that once that happens they will be very interesting to her.At the moment all she wants are things that she can stuff into her mouth.My lil man will eat & play with all of these blocks.He is 10 months now and he especially loves the red block that makes a paper noise.The other smaller green block has an apple teether on it that they sometimes chew on and the biggest blue one has a butterfly that is the crinkly material, sticking out from the one side.I think these are reasonably priced.That is probably their most loved/played with toy we have right now.my daughter HATES being in a car seat so when i saw this toy i had to get it to try it out.I LOVE that it has a timer and it actually goes for as long as 60 mins so we can drive places without having to restart it.We do not have a head rest or anything like that and it was smart and made a way to tuck the buckles in the slate behind the seat and it actually stays in place!I love this toy and she doesn't scream any more on car rides.So mad, this does NOT work in the middle of the rear seat in our Trailblazer which there isn't a headrest.What a waste of $30.Maybe I'll put it on his crib.first off it was extremely hard to mount to the carseat safely.no matter how hard my husband or i tightened it, the slightest tug from our daughter would make it collapse and fall on her.i can't believe that this was ever tested out by children, because if it was they would have made some huge changes in design!But I later got him the Fisher Price Rainforest baby gym, and that one has a much more useful structure.The Fisher Price gym allows you more ways to add toys and links, and has a brighter more appealing look to it.The Fisher Price gym came with only a solid plastic mirror to hang down low, however, so we took the mirror from the Baby Einstein gym and moved it back and forth.Both have great features, and in the long run, we needed both, as my son loved them so much.It's kinda small for my tall girl.plus the mat itself is very garish and not soothing to the eye.. it's too much going on for li'l kids.. i dont think kids at this age care to learn about the whole world.. i wish there was a cheaper option for something like kushies shangrila mat.. the kushies mat is simple and pleasant for babies..The musical toy is handy but again it is not the best design for babies.. it could be simpler in color and could use some hanging toys and a combination of contrasting black and white and soothing colors.I returned it.He really liked the bird's hair and wings.He also liked to get right under the panda and eat his feet.The rattle is great to but he likes it better when I take it off so he can hit things with it.I felt terrible, im having to order another one because i know he misses it, and now so do i.Our 10-week old loves to laugh at herself in this mirror.It's bright colors are really cute and the mirror easily attaches to the crib or our car headrests.Baby (9 months) liked the blocks but prefers to play with more noisy/advanced stuffs.I should have gotten this when she was maybe 2 to 4 months old!She got these blocks when she was 4 months.She is now 8 months old and still likes to chew on them.Right now she prefers the one with all the tags.This product is a waste of money.If your baby doesn't like being on her tummy, this product will not make any difference.Save your money and just use a blanket and yourself to motivate your little one to  enjoy being on her tummy, because this product does not help!I got these for my daughter to take to school with her lunches.They are very cute and I love the cover.The spoon is a little large.My daughter asked me to purchase this for my grandson.She had heard really great reviews about them and guess what... here is another one.It's also super cute!!!Right now he walks with his shoulders pulled forward, but I'm sure he'll adjust to it with use.The carry handle on top is helpful when he's carrying it from here to there to stuff things inside.He immediately filled the bag with Wheat Thins, which I immediately dumped out and had to clean the bag.He then filled it with a random assortment of toys.It's not a school bag, however, so don't be bummed if you can't fit a folder and books in it.UPDATE: My son loves his backpack so much he often sleeps with it.One night he wet the bed and got a LOT on the back pack.It came out in very good shape, though looking a little worn.I will be back for a third when my daughter turns two in 16 months.They better still be available!UPDATE 4/17/13: - Just bought a third for my daughter!And the only thing that really pooped it out was a couple of runs in the washing machine.I mean, there are a lot, but they are all just so...well, girly!!I really wanted the Dia de los Muertos backpack, but my husband said that was me trying too hard (still, I like it!)Still cute, but they need tomboy options.If you're thinking about buying it, I'd go for it.They are too big on my 2 yr old so will use the mitten clips until the straps don't fall off her shoulders.I bought this for my two year old to keep his collection of cars in.This is my first and only child so I didn't know that "Little Kid" back pack meant mini backpack.Im a novice mom so that was a mistake.The pack is really cute though.Despite the surprise I love this back pack and I would recommend this product to others looking for a cute small back pack for a toddler.We bought this for two reasons - 1) her little bag for school was worn out and she needed a new one, 2)airplane trip and needed a place for snacks.I think this bag has plenty of room for a little kid or toddler.We were able to fit a lot in there, but if you make it too heavy, then your really little one won't be able to carry it.But things like cheerios, a sippy cup, a couple of books and diapers fit in there just fine without it being too heavy for her.The only thing I would change is to make the drink pocket on the outside more secure.My son is 1 and we use it to carry his daily supplies back and forth to daycare and as a substitute diaper bag.He likes the bright colors and he knows it's his bag.The name-tag inside didn't bleed and run when I wrote my son's name on it like most fabric tags do.The front pocket is great for the things you need more frequently like kleenux, and small toys, and it has a loop you can hook your keys onto.I so glad I got this; I just ordered the matching lunchbox and if I'm half as happy with it as I am with this backpack I'll be really pleased.Two weeks after I posted this review, and after barely 2 months of use, the zipper for the main compartment broke.I was heartbroken.I searched everywhere for the receipt so I could call for a possible replacement, but no luck.I spent an hour trying to repair it, which to my amazement, I eventually did, but now I feel that it's fragile and I'm waiting for it to break again.So I wanted to add this warming.Do not over-pack and stretch the zipper, it's only plastic and will stretch and bend.Keep an eye on the teeth as you can see them separating and that is your warning of impending breakage.I know this is made for little kids, but if I was the maker of this product I think that I would use a metal zipper for the main compartment as they are stronger and can take a lot more abuse than a plastic one.I still love and would recommend this product, I'd just be a little more careful with it.It's now been 9 months since I repaired the zipper and I haven't had a single problem with it since then.And, we LOVE the lunch box just as much as the backpack.I now have one of these backpacks and the matching lunchboxes for both of my kids.I wanted an alternative to her huge diaper bag for the days I'm just making a quick trip or when I want to carry other things that don't fit into my smaller petunia pickle bottom tote.It is smaller than what i thought it would be bust still big enough for its intended purpose.Very cute overall and seems to be of good quality.But only time will tell how long it last.My only gripe: the side water bottle netting is not high enough to hold those toddler sports bottles, so they fall out sometimes and into the mud.I put my own stuff in there, too.I got the smaller Zoo Lunchies in Monkey also.They don't match but I don't think they should anyway.Since my four year-old is still just a little guy, I thought I would save the spider man, iron man etc... backpacks for when he starts kindergarten (or later if I can help it).Those bags are just ugly and while I can still pick things out for him, I'll pick cute things.This bag qualifies.I love it- and it is not too cute (right??I was worried that it would be too big for his back, but too small for his school stuff.Really satisfied with this purchase!I rarely give low-star ratings.I purchased the mouse for my daughter with the intent of use for kindergarten, but it doesn't fit anything!I bought it, stupidly assuming that it would at least fit the folder she's using to carry papers back and forth to/from school.I was completely wrong - it's just too short.I love how cute this thing is and we even have the matching lunchbox, but it won't work for any child trying to use it for school.My daughter loves the backpack, so we kept it and she is using it to tote around toys - but it's disappointing because we bought it for school.I ordered this bag for my 2 year old son for car trips & soon for an overnight visit with my parents.He loves packing his own things so this bag has been a big hit!Its not huge like a regular school backback (so it wont fit large books, folders, etc) but its perfect for a toddler.It fits a bunch of board books and other smaller toys.This is the cutest toddler back back ever.He keeps his coloring books and crayons in it, and when we go out for the day he can bring pull ups and a change of clothes as well.I bought this car seat two years ago (it may have changed a little since then - I don't know) and have loved it since the day we started using it.Recently I was in a serious car accident where my vehicle hit a utility pole and flipped over twice.The car seat did not move and my child was not injured at all.Not a scrape or bruise on him.Needless to say I replaced the car seat with the same model.I had two of these seats professionally installed for free by our local family resource center(highly suggested).The harness is easy to tighten with a turn of either one of the side knobs, but not as easy to loosen(though still not difficult).CONS:  I am having difficulty accessing the harness tightening knobs located on each side of the rear-facing car seat because of how closely wedged they are to the back seat of my SUV.This is obviously not a problem with the forward-facing seat.I am also having a hard time pressing the buttons on the chest clip as well as the crotch clip.Hopefully this will improve with frequent use over time.I also wish the seat reclined just a little more for my toddler, but I am sure this varies based on how reclined and deep the back seat of your vehicle is.Initially, I was worried I would lose any space in my center seat because of how wide these car seats are, but that was not the case.However, I would add shoulder strap covers so the red harness tabs don't irritate your little one.The hook to hang from the shower, allows for a thorough dry.Overall, baby is happy so mommy is happy.We used the sling and it was great.I just don't understand why this tub is so much more expensive than others.My mom has the First Years tub and it has nice cushy padding and a compartment to keep shampoo bottles.I sometimes want to trade her because hers seems more comfy.We'll see how this works as he gets older.You can't tell from the picture just how pink these are.I was hoping for something a little more gender neutral.They sure are cute though--I really hope it's a girl!I bought this little bear because of the three previous five-star reviews.It was meant as a present for my young grandson, visiting us for the first time.He took to this little guy right away, hugging it until he fell asleep clutching it.He ended up taking this little bear back with him to comfort him on the plane ride.Although the "purring" sound was sometimes hard to activate, the softness and the hugability of this bear is what attracted my grandson to this comforter.On the back of the package is a small green caveat "Ideal for Ages 3 and up."That is, I assume, because of the low-lying grey ribbon around the bear's neck, and the possiblity that a determined toddler may be able to wrestle the powerbox inside the bear's tummy open.I truly love this polar bear, probably much more than my son does at this point.He is still only 4 months and does not get much use of it, especially since it is intended for older babies.He has a velcro lining on his side that opens up and there is a (heart shaped) device that allows the bear to "shiver" or vibrate gently for a reasonable amount of time (about a minute or so).There are many options for the settings on the bear vibrations: timer, off, and hug allow you to control how long the vibrations will last.Perhaps if you pinch and pull on his fur this will happen, which has not been a problem for me.This toy is great for babies and toddlers to fall asleep with.I also bought it to replace the LeapFrog Learning Baby Tad which has a night mode.The LeapFrog only has 2 volume settings and low was almost as loud as high.PROS:-The volume can be changed with the volume dial-Sleep timer: 23 and 45 minutes-4 sound tracks: safari with drum beats, jungle waterfall with a frog, white noise track and heartbeat.-Removable sound box; you can wash the giraffe and keep it clean (unlike LeapFrog)!It measures 4.5"x3"x0.9" and weights 5.3oz-The velcro straps are long enough (6"x2) to attach the giraffe to a crib and hang itWhen I put him to sleep or when he starts to fuss, I pick one of the soundtracks and play it for 23 minutes.The sound track helps him fall asleep.CONS:-So far noneI would definitely recommend it to new moms!this is a great idea.i like that it has timers but wish there was a setting for it to stay on.I have both BumGenius and Thirsties AIOs in size XS...my daughter is 10 lbs, 12 oz now and still fits in the Thirsties XS but outgrew her BumGenius over a month ago.They take awhile to dry but make cloth diapering super easy.First of all I own three Thirsties Fab Fitted diapers and several Thirsties Duo wraps and have had no leaking problems with either.I washed and machine dried these diapers three times with my other diapers and covers (cold water prewash w/ vinegar, hot wash with All Free and Clear, super rinse) before I tried them out.I stuffed them with a hemp insert and a cotton gauze flat fold for nighttime.My poor little one woke up about five hours later in a puddle!The diaper had leaked out the back.I stuffed another diaper that same night and tried again.Another puddle :(.I proceeded to check the final diaper for repelling the next morning and it seemed to be doing it's job.I then checked the seams and made sure the diaper fit properly.I washed and machine dried three more times and tried again.This time during the day with no inserts.It was soaked after an hour!Maybe I had mineral/soap residue.I stripped the diapers by themselves using 1TBSP Dawn soap in a hot water wash with three HOT rinses.Machine dried.Stuffed for overnight and got to change the sheets.....I washed the diaper with my diapers as usual and it reeked of ammonia when I took it out.I have finally given up.My Fab fitted diapers are made of the same material and I have never had to strip them and have not experienced any lingering odors.It also wasn't my inserts as I have NEVER had to strip my flats or my hemp and they are very absorbant.I am so confused.Some of the other reviewers have had great success with the diaper and I am glad.It is a great (in theory) diaper for a great price.Thirsties Pocket All-in-One's have changed my opinion of cloth diapers, however.I guess I had an image in my mind of sticking my baby with diaper pins, washing out soiled diapers in the toilet, and constantly washing diapers.I decided to switch when my 9 month-old had continuing problems with raw patches on his diaper area.It started around the elastic and then spread, despite trying every cream or powder, Rx or otherwise.I finally concluded that it must be something in the disposable diaper material.I like the thought of saving the environment as well.When I had problems with leaks, I looked harder and found these.I like that you can add extra padding for naps, nighttime or a car ride, and use as is for light duty.My only small complaint is that they take a long time to line dry since the padding is built in.It helps if you turn them inside out, but I still end up having to put them in to dryer to finish them up, which I hope does not make them wear out faster.I wish I had discovered them sooner.Will not fit my 40 lb child.So I am using it on my 30 lb child and it seems to be doing the job with her weight.Washed good too.It's nice looking, meets all the new safety standards, no drop side so no worries and it has an adjustable height on the mattress to make up for the change in safety standards regarding drop sides.We got the cherry finish and my wife was worried, but it's a classic victorian cherry so you're getting a dark red stain, very nice.Standard mattress fits nicely inside, no gaps, and the mattress support is a steel frame with steel mesh and springs.So why the 4 stars?Well, because it's a typical self assembly, allen wrench, thumb blister kit.I swear it's been a week and the side of my thumb still hurts from tightening all of the screws.I still don't understand to this day why they stopped using Phillips screws for these kits and it really wouldn't be so bad accept for the fact that my daughter learned how to pull herself up about 5 minutes after we finished the crib and put her in it.We had built it at the top height so we could get her out easier.We thought it'd save us some back pain and it would be fine since she couldn't stand up without help.Well OF COURSE she stood up right after that, that's what kids do.... sigh.So I had to unscrew the most difficult screws in the bed and re-screw them in new slots using that annoyingly thin little allen wrench.But that's really my only gripe.The packaging was fine, no damage to the crib, lots of Styrofoam, cardboard supports and separators.I'm a big guy so I could actually lift the package myself, though it does say "Team Lift" on the side and if I wasn't 6'5" I couldn't have carried it alone, to long and awkward.But the weight was very manageable, not like most solid hardwood cribs that weigh a ton.For the price I really couldn't be happier with this purchase.And knowing that it converts into a day bed and then a head and foot board when she's ready just makes it feel like that much more of a bargain.If you're worried about the side coming off prematurely, don't, it's bolted on just like the other sides.I'll write an update if anything happens.So here's a tip for anyone who hasn't done many of these "DIY furniture" kits.Once you've got it put together, go back through every screw from the beginning and try tightening them again.Lots of screws will loosen as you tighten others.Read the warning for the mattress height, If your child can pull themselves up on their own, the mattress goes at the lowest setting, trust me, you don't want to have to re-set this thing anytime soon, the mattress screws are painted ends so they kind of glue in, very difficult to get them back out.I got this crib on sale and had a gift card, so it only cost me $35!!If you are looking for super fancy, this is not your crib.For the price you cant beat this crib.It has lasted 18 months and we are now converting it to the toddler bed.Very high end style, without the high end price tag.We also purchased the matching dressing table and it works great too!!Update: 11/24/10 It is STILL beautiful and functional.We haven't even scratched the stain!I am still in love with it, and it's matching "dressing table".This one was so inexpensive that I thought it might look and feel cheap when it arrived.I am very picky about things being perfect, and I have no problems with the way this looks or feels.It's not rickety at all, but very stable.I can tell that the wood will probably be easy to scratch, so I will have to buy some teething rails for the sides.We put it together in an hour and had no problems with assembly."My daughter is now 11 months old, and I just ordered a solid wood crib from Pottery Barn.This Graco crib is flimsy, which didn't bother me when she couldn't pull up and just lay there, but now when I hear the "ga-dunk, ga-dunk, ga-dunk" of her standing up and shaking the side of the crib, I get nervous.The drop-side was recalled and requires a special kit to make it fixed.In a single day, my daughter has chewed the finish off in one place; it looks like a squirrel got to it.I wish I had saved my $150 (which was the price at the time) and just bought the more expensive crib to begin with.Love this cribAwsome price for a great product.I used these for my first days of nursing.That cold, wet feeling was so soothing, and these gels completely eliminated chafing in my bra.On the down side, I had to use the hospital-issue breast pads with them, because all other breast pads dried the hydrogels out and shortened their lifespan.Also, anything that keeps your nipple area moist can help candida (yeast) infections thrive if you happen to get unlucky enough to contract one.If you think your pain is caused by candida, discontinue use, air dry your nipples, and see your doctor for a swab and culture ASAP.Also, I highly recommend "all purpose nipple ointment" for those first few weeks of breast feeding.I had a particularly difficult time breastfeeding, and tried just about everything to be pain free.These gels helped me for a while, but did not cure my problems the way they do for some women.I recommend them with the caveat that they are not appropriate if you get a yeast infection, and that you really need to see a doctor if your nipple pain lasts more than two weeks.Good luck with the nursing!It gets easier, I promise!I never thought it would, but now it's a cinch.I'm so glad I stuck with it!Very soft cotton.I also liked how well it was packed in box which stated "camo baby" (u can see it on a pic).Plastic is soft, the lid fits snugly and the suction seal is strong.A great product over all.Will come back to update if it doesn't hold up.Another item on my list of gifts for a baby shower.Our local baby store didn't carry the side covers, only the front.I pulled both the front rail and side rail covers back after I noticed him gnawing really hard on the crib and to my surprise the pads were soaked with drool, but the crib was untouched, no marks, no slobber.I really wish I'd know about the side covers on Amazon for my daughters crib and perhaps we wouldn't have little tooth scratches all over her expensive bed.I had to break down and buy these for our crib.We spent a lot of money on a nice crib, and started seeing chip marks on it.Took me a bit to figure out how they got there, until I walked in on my son with his teeth dug into the wood.So it's protecting the wood from further damage, and more importantly keeping the chips out of his mouth.I had bought the one for the front of the crib, not thinking he would move to the sides, but I was mistaken.I have a convertable crib.I have these side rail covers and also the front rail cover (why don't they sell them together in a package?).I spent $500 on the convertible crib, and I actually want it to last through the toddler bed & full-size stages.Well worth the $$!I've tried using these a few times.I'm really not sure why, since normally he likes stuffed animals.(Their other stuffed animals are brown bears, a golden puppy, etc.)My other toddler (the more accident-prone one) has had mixed reactions to the Boo Boo bunny over the past few months since I got it.More recently he has wanted to cuddle it and let me briefly apply it to his injured spot.Basically, I would say it's hit or miss whether your toddler will like it or not.Also, the ice pack doesn't seem to be quite the right size for the bunny; it's a bit big and hard to put in the cover.Not sure if this is a problem with others or just inconsistent manufacturing.Great design and our kiddo took right too it when we introduced it to him at 10 months old.The only issue I have with the Safe Sippy is that it is difficult to clean.Instructions on how to clean or maybe including a special brush for cleaning purposes would be helpful.Oh and it doesn't spill!A pus since our little guy is always trying to pour the water out...The colors on an activity mat are important as that's what ur baby is going to be introduced to the first thing.The colors on the mat are not close to what's shown on the website.I did not try the one click thing of opening and closing the mat.I found it small for my tall baby and overall the mat has a cheap garish color look and feel.Returning it.I have accepted that my home will be full of brightly colored toys for the next 5 years or so.We move the mirror around and he gets different views.We had another play mat, but he likes this one MUCH better.The mat fold up quickly, making it great to take along or take apart to throw in the wash.I have a 2 1/2 year old and because it locks on the top he can't collapse the toy bar on my infant!The toys make chime noise but only one makes a song (my husband and sister-in-law both have bachelors in early childhood development and agree that too much noise and distraction are not good for baby's development.Great buy!!!I didn't want some horrendous pink thing that couldn't be used for the next baby, and this seems pretty neutral to me.Anyway, I chose this gym for a few reasons:1.Not full of plastic.Lots of the gyms I looked at had soo many plastic toys and we are trying to limit the plastic in our home - this gym has 4 plush toys (some with little plastic accents).3.Nice looking - I liked the colours and the cute little animals that hang4.Toys can be interchanged.If you don't like the toys that are hanging, you can remove them.Cons:The toys are supposedly supposed to be "wiped clean" which frankly isn't good enough when your baby spits up all over them.I threw them all in the machine on the delicate cycle and they came out fine (even the musical one) - but you can tell that too many washings will destroy themThe pillow does suck.As another review stated, the "tummy time" pillow is a piece of junk.It doesn't really do much to "prop up" a heavier baby (and my girl is a big one!I didn't want to pay twice as much for something full of plastic and music, but other gyms were tiny or lame looking.I think this is a good middle-of-the-road.I added more hanging toys for variety.We got it for him when he was just a couple of weeks old and he has been using it ever since.We have taken this mat everywhere!I love the colors and design and the fact that it is so entertaining for my baby and doesn't require batteries that constantly need replacing.The directions for folding aren't very clear, but once you figure it out, it's a breeze.It has an expensive look for an affordable price.While this product is for smaller babies, newborns and up, my eighteen month old loved it.He wanted to play with each toy and check out each square.Even though he was too big to fit under the crossbars, he still enjoyed sitting up and playing with this.You can guarantee it will grow with your baby.I think one of my absolute favorite things about the Twist & Fold Activity Gym (aside from the colors, which I really LOVE) is the fact that it is so easy to fold up for portability or to store.With this one, you twist the top knob, and wrap it up.There is nothing to take apart; all toys stay as they are and you don't have to worry about losing anything!Overall, I think this is a wonderful product.I just can't wait to have a newborn under it.Can't you just imagine the pictures?I am a participant in a Mom Central campaign for Infantino and have received various Infantino products to as part of my participation.The thermometer itself (we have the Frog) is cute, but functionally has some flaws.First, you have to lift it out of the water or tilt it to read it.As soon as you do, it starts dropping in temp, so you get mixed readings.Additionally, if the water is above or below the temperature boundaries (92 - 102), it just stays black.You can figure it out based on waving your hand around in the water, and then warming or cooling until it shows up on the readings, but then you have to fiddle with it more.When it does fall in the small range it's made for, it's nice to have a specific temperature rather than just a "Hot", but for the cost, you might as well go for theAquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Greendigital thermometer and save yourself the trouble.I like this one, I always test the hotness of the water before I bath my baby and it works good, and It is a good price too.For us, the best !You can reuse all the products, easy to combine with other options.These are much better than the honey colored Avent bottles!I also feel like the outside of the bottle feels a little sticky for some reason.No leaks and no sticky feel.So, the adapter ring is key!I have not had a single leak with these bottles.(in comparison to the original Avent bottles) I only wih they would sell these with a faster flow nipple.Most babies who would require a 9oz bottle are probably using a faster flow nipple.They do not leak and are easy to clean.I breastfed my daughter and she had no difficulty using these from when she was 3 weeks old.I will definitely use these again when we have more children.I have to admit that I've had them leak a few times when I didn't.That's my fault and not the bottle's.Make sure you get the ones in the blue box.I got two amber colored bottles included with myPhilips AVENT BPA Free ISIS iQ Duo Twin Electric Breast Pump, White.The wide mouth makes her sucking look more like what she does on the breast than other bottles.She doesn't have to let go and let air enter.The bottle lets her keep sucking.That's a life saver considering my baby doesn't really like to eat and anything that interrupts her is a problem.Edit:  After 4 months our daughter was still having gas problems.Our pediatrician suggested we try Dr. Brown's.We tried it and her gas problem was reduced drastically.Hind sight is 20/20!I originally bought about 10 of the honey colored Avent bottles and after about 5 months got so annoyed with the leaking I threw them all away.I then started to purchase these which don't leak at all so that's a major improvement.Its not a problem for me yet as I do not make 9 ounce bottles but I assume it will be soon.Also the nipple tends to collapse which can be a bit annoying.In my opinion, this bottle is good (better than the honey colored Avent bottles), but The best bottle out there is definitely the Born Free Bottles and the Gerber Gentle Flow bottles (which by the way are the exact same thing as Avent bottles minus the ring and the peeling paint and way cheaper).First, let me state that I am ONLY referring to the clear plastic bottles - not the ones with the yellow tint (I LOVE those bottles!).I dislike the clear plastic bottles because they leak.And if you don't get it on just right, your bottle will leak all over you and your poor little one.Sure, that's not a HUGE deal, but if you are using both the clear plastic ones AND the yellow tinted ones, it can be a pain at 3am to figure out which one you are using.I'd still say spend the extra dollar to get the yellow ones.I started using this when my baby was about 2 weeks old.He has taken well w/ this bottle.He cries when he sees one of his bottles because he wants it :)It is definitely not an inch thick, however.I think you need two sets to make a decent size mat.It is easy to clean.I have to say this is a great looking playmate so much better than the crazy alphabet mats.We walk on it all day long and it never comes apart.My only gripe is the price of the mat for the size.It's 4'x4' So I would need to buy at least 2 more to cover the area.Of course this is my own fault as I didn't pay close attention to the dimensions but for the price, I probably would have considered the skip hop mat for about $80 because it is a lot bigger.We have the letter and number mats for my older son's room.These are just as thick.With the letters and such you have to search for the individual letters and the little circles that accompany the letters (like the center of the P or the two circles for the number 8).The foam does indent easily so you have to be careful not to step on it with heels or shoes.The hardwood floor underneath the mat becomes very slippery when you move the mat (slippery enough that you or someone else can take a nasty fall).Also, this exact same item is available for half the retail price at Ross.The thing about having a baby, you just never know what to expect, especially for your first one.My baby is eight months old now and I waited this long on purpose to write the reviews on baby items that we ordered.It is SO light, it makes changing the sheets a snap.It is free of fumes due to the organic manufacture, and if you think about it, they spend SO much time faceplanted in it, that I wanted my baby to not be inhaling all those fumes from the time that he was a few weeks old!It is slightly more expensive that other baby mattresses, but truly has held up great, and I would buy it again ten times over.Do not hesitate to purchase this mattress.My husband and I are very conscious of what we expose our child to, so choosing a mattress that was not going to give off toxic gases was a priority.I would definately reccommend it.My kitchen cabinet is a death trap with falling toddler plates that don't nest together.I'm planning on putting away the other dishes we have and using these plates.I can see using these until my daughter is much older.Not to mention cheap enough to replace if need be.These plates are good for babies.They don't break!!!They do slide all over the table because there is no grip on the bottom.I love these plates but I regret ordering them from amazon as I would bought them cheaper 3$ in my target store.These are cute plates.I like these plates a lot.But do follow the warning that they should go on the top rack of the dishwasher only... they will melt if you put them on the bottom!I generally hand-wash because I'm unsure how it might break down in the dishwasher.(This is not to say the KidCo is a bad product.I simply prefer the Green Sprouts one.The one reason I can see for the KidCo might be if your baby is just starting solid foods, and this is because the KidCo has smaller holes in the grinding surface and hence makes food slightly less textured.The KidCo also came with an extra gasket, and some versions come with a carrying case.Also, the KidCo is a little less prone to leaking liquid out the base.)Pros of the Green Sprouts:--Bigger overall, meaning more room in the base to fill with food and more room in the bowl for milled food.It also has a 'pour' spout on the bowl.--Easier to understand.The Green Sprouts directions were longer and clearer.--Easier to use.The KidCo is stiffer and harder to push down and harder to turn.--Easier to disassemble.The KidCo is a pain in the rear to get apart.I often have to jam a toothpick in one of the holes in the grate to get the top to unscrew.By comparison, I just tighten the easy-turn knob on the Green Sprouts' central post and then unscrew the top.--Easier to clean.I frequently have to painstakingly use a toothpick to poke food out of the tiny holes in the grate on the KidCo.With the Green Sprouts the holes are bigger and food rinses right out.--Stainless steel both on the turning part that crushes the food and on the grate that the food squishes through.(As for the reviewer who had this 'explode'... it must either be a fluke or she was grinding counterclockwise instead of clockwise.I have never had that problem with this mill, nor do I see how it would even be possible.But for what it claims to do, the Green Sprouts carries through 100%.I haven't used it for meats yet, but I'm sure it would do fine mincing/tearing it apart.I'm waiting to hear back from the customer service to see if they will replace a lost handle shaft part.Love this mill.Forget about trying to do bulk meals or anything slightly liquidy.Bulk meals (like an ice cube tray worth of peas) just makes your hand hurt and you have to refill over and over because it doesn't hold much.Plus the grinder part is made poorly and doesn't fit well into the grooves.Hard to get undone after I'm finished using it.The only good part is that it's totally dishwasher safe and it does wash well.And it's cheap.This mill was very easy to use and clean, however, I really did not use it that much--just peas and sweet potatoes in the beginning.I used the food processor much more and didn't end up using the mill more than a couple of times.I didn't want to spend a fortune on a baby food processor unless I knew for sure that making my own was going to work out.This produces the same consistency you'd get with a potato ricer, which worked fine for us.Be sure to put a paper towel under the mill if you're grinding something juicy like pears.And don't use it on Mango.It's stringy, doesn't puree well and leaves the mill a mess!Obviously, it isn't a food processor, so it can't handle anything too dense, and it does not puree.We are happy with this product, and it is very easy to clean!Be careful not to over fill as the cubes will be harder to punch out.Ready to pop out into the bag once frozen.1 cube green beans: 2 carrots/zuchini: 1 cube apples/sweet potatoes)  Highly reccomend this item!.I bought these to freeze our baby purees.Really easy to use and clean!Just wish it came in 2 oz serving size as well!This tray is simple and does what it's supposed to do.I wish there was a hard plastic frame around the top to make it easier to grip when you're trying to push that cube out.It's just b/c it's a little tough to empty.Just fill the tray, freeze, empty, and toss in the dishwasher.I really like this, especially because it's BPA free.Once my baby food is frozen, I take it out and store it in labeled freezer bags to keep them fresh.I just push from the bottom and they slide right out.So far I have pureed sweet potatoes and peas...2 sweet potatoes or about 2 1/2 cups of peas thinned out with breastmilk (or formula) seems to be about the right amount to fill up the tray.I am still waiting for the product to arrive (I made an order on Amazon months ago).However, I have gotten one previously as a part of a Green Sprouts set and found it to be VERY useful.You can connect it to any water bottle and feed the baby.It doesnt screw in well onto the bottle and it ends up leaking.Pros: they are made of silicone, and are thus BPA and PVC free.She seems to like them just fine.Cons: they are clear.Looking for a pacifier in the middle of the night?Within three weeks I had lost both of them.It was obvious to me this is not a food processor.I like that fact that you can attach the spoon to the lid.We don't have a microwave, nor do we want one.I just bring water to an almost boiling point, pour it in the bottom of the warming dish, wait a few minutes, stir the food, and it's all set to feed.This is easy to clean as well.I also purchased the utensils and bowl to go along with them.You are not supposed to put them in the dishwasher or microwave, but that didnt matter to me- you shouldn't put baby food in the mic anyways.I plan to purchase more when he starts eating more too.Just as a rebuttal to other reviews: the plate does stick well to the surface, but you have to flip the suction ring first, so that the wide side sits on the table surface.For some reason it arrives with the detachable ring attached upside down (perhaps for easier packing?).Otherwise it looks cute and holds heat well.My 6 month old is a big drooler and we have lots of spit-up.He sometimes soaks through 6+ regular bibs a day.With these bibs I'm often down to no more than 2 bibs a day, and I only change the bib b/c it smells like spit-up, it never leaks through to the back side.I've also had trouble with some bibs having neck holes that are too large - these are perfect.Probably would've fit fine even younger as well.The washing instructions say not to put them in the dryer, but I do and so far so good (I've had them for several weeks).Great product!I just think the Green Sprouts bibs are funny, and at the same time they are a very well-made, practical product.I didn't think the opening in the top was too big at all.I have several of these bibs and they are so cute.This bib is adorable and I had no problem with the quality, but I had to send it back because the neck hole was much too large for my 6 month old.How impractical is it that you can't put these bibs in the dryer, they have to be line-dried.Ours had the iron-on image in front actually melt and stick together in a wad.I've used 4 other diaper brands, and I finally broke down and tried the Thirsties.Now why didn't I find thirsties to BEGIN with?), the velcro closure allows me to cinch the diaper closed on my baby that is actually only 13 pounds (and I'm using size 2, for 18lbs+), and I now have a diaper that moved my baby from newborn diaper covers, to Size Two thirsties!I'm set for the rest of infancy!Also, the material feels very durable (less likely to develop little rips like my Flip diapers that I thought I had loved, previously).I will be buying more, for sure!I bought a plain medium one and a duo to compare and the fabrics are the same.The size medium is pretty big, about the same as the second snap setting on the duo.I prefer the duo since it will last me longer even if I eventually have to buy a large non-convertible one, but hopefully it won't come to that.The only thing I would say about these is to have several on hand to change throughout the day to prevent the edging from wicking.I have both the Thirsties Diaper cover and the Thirsties Duo Wrap.Like some of the other reviewers, I haven't noticed any differences between the two covers other than size.We have been clot diapering our little one since birth, so about 4 months.We have a pretty broad range of items, as we wanted to try many different things out before investing in a large quantity of anything.The Thirsties Duo Wrap that we have is definitely one of our PUL favourites.The size 1 fit her as a newborn (7 lbs 15 oz) and still just (barely) fits on our baby, but she is a big girl (16 lbs, 26 1/4 inches).We haven't had any of the quality issues that some reviewers have mentioned, but we have a pretty large rotation, so perhaps we haven't washed ours as much yet.I love wool more, but as far as a "wipe-clean" PUL cover goes, I have found this one to be great.I have no use for the Thirsties Fab Fitteds though - they barely seemed to absorb anything - we love our simple and cheap prefolds!I'm so glad I ignored them!What a waste that would have been!Don't waste your time with anything else.All my friends who did the "multiple systems" prefer thirsties, and their other systems sit unused in a drawer!Yes, this is the only system I have tried besides disposables, but these are BETTER.I got both since regular ones had more reviews, and better ones.You can get the prefolds from [...].You need 3 covers of each size and about 25 prefolds of each of 2 sizes, and you can diaper from birth to potty training for about $200.If you have money to burn, do yourself a favor and buy this system anyway and give the leftover to charity.The more expensive systems are not better, just read the reviews!!!Prefolds are so time tested... your really can't go wrong.And the thirsties covers are the best there is.If you still really want to waste money, just send it to someone who needs it and get this diaper system anyway!Hes 14 now and they're getting pretty snug.At night I can not use these as my son is a heavy wetter and I can not fit an insert in with the daiper so we use the regular thirsties.Also, due to the fabric on some inner locations they can get a bit damp...I can use them once or twice over, while the original I can use over and over all day.Still though, no leaks.Tabs stay velcroed.It's super-adjustable so that my newborn can wear it now (at 8 lbs) and will definitely be wearing it for many months to come.I also appreciate how it dips slightly at the belly button (and can be adjusted to avoid contact with it)so it's not rubbing up against that sensitive area.The pattern is cute, too.I think I'll be ordering more because these covers will fit for a while to come.I used Bummis on my first child and there was newborn poop spilling out of the sides all over his legs and his clothes.I ordered these and started using them on my son when he was 3 weeks old.He's a chubby baby, but not longer than average.Maybe if I had smaller size prefolds, but I just use the regular Gerber prefold diapers and I've had to use this in its largest size since 3 weeks old.I am going to get the next size because I like the gussets, but I am hoping that I'll be able to use it for longer than I used size one.The size 1 duos also worked great for us but the size 2 ones seem to leak more and the gussets are stretched out after 2 months of use.Again, that is after only a few uses so it may not hold up either, time will tell.I was first overwhelmed by the cloth diaper cover choices when I was shopping for my new baby.I love that these can grow with baby, so 4 (size 1) orchid covers went into my shopping cart!My baby is 4 weeks old, and we all (mom, dad, and baby) love these!I have never had poop leak or pee seep through in a cloth with these covers!I use them day and night!And my baby knows how to soak a diaper, it all stays in where it belongs!4 covers was a good choice, 3 would not be enough.I wash them w/ my cloth diapers in a cold cycle, then take then out to air dry before my cloths go to a hot cycle.I don't know if my size ones will fit to 9 months like the tag says, I suppose it varies baby to baby.I will definately be buying size two when we get there.great product, good quality.adjustable.A must have for those mommies using cloth diapers.They also stay pretty soft even when hung to dry.I know a lot of people say that hemp holds onto the urine smell but I haven't had that problem yet, maybe because I do a wash every day?My one-month-old daughter is a heavy wetter.I use bumGenius!and she usually has wet jammies & bedding after overnight naps which last about five hours.I got these yesterday and did not see that it needed to be prepped with several washings like other liners so I slid one into her bumGenius!.With the first one, it was a one-size with its own removable newborn liner, she managed to leak but only a little.I changed her and put the second one into her all-in-one bumGenius!, the second one was a set size.It was a small and it's a pocket diaper but the liner is built in.That worked a lot better.She's still relatively dry after six hours with that combination.feels a little damp instead of her clothing and bedding.Also I only just noticed that with this liner and the bGs that the cloth against her skin inside the diaper feels only damp whereas before it felt very wet.(And she has definitely wet the diaperbumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper - Grasshopper.)They both preform well.I think that baby kicks might have a slightly higher hemp content, but they're both very absorbent, and these are a little bit cheaper.I recommend boiling these when you get them.They are thinner than the microterry inserts, but absorb plenty of fluid despite their trim profile.I highly recommend doubling up with hemp inserts if you're having trouble with leaky wet diapers.All of Elsie's damp morning problems were cured when we started double-stuffing with these or the baby kicks.I wish I would have figured this out months ago... would have saved me a lot of laundry.These hemp inserts are the best value that I've found so far.These doublers have increased the absorbency of my prefold diapers from two hours to four.This allows my Little One to take a long nap and sleep longer at night without feeling wet.I hang them up overnight to dry and occasionally pop them in the dryer.No pilling!I also got some of the BabyKicks ones.These are much less bulky than what comes with FuzziBunz.These are my go to inserts for my Fuzzi Bunz diapers.I have been cloth diapering my 2-year-old since she was about two months old, and these inserts are among the best products that helped us continue using cloth after she was no longer an infant.As she got bigger, I tried adding a microfiber doubler or a second insert, which worked okay, but these inserts are really much better--they're pretty thin (thinner than a regular microfiber insert), but they absorb and hold onto liquid--that is, they resist compression leaks (from the diaper getting squeezed out and leaking when she is sitting for a while, like if her diaper is wet while she is in her high chair or car seat).They are also a really good value for hemp--less than $4 each for six layers of hemp jersey, which is the best value I found (other hemp inserts are cheaper, but often only 2 layers).I've been really happy with them--they make cloth diapering much more feasible as an option for an older child or for overnight.My little boy (now almost 18 months) has very thick and wavy hair.It gets a lot of tangles as a result so with a little "no more tangles" spray and this comb, I can get the knots out with little pain.This was great in the initial weeks because we were dealing with cradle cap.Bromine is all over it.And copper is in the shade.Buyer beware.One star.Some infant carseats are so complex to figure out.I like the the directions are printed in the base as to how to install it into the car, very helpful if you forget to bring the manual out.The seat is lightweight, well constructed and looks really nice in person.The car seat base does come with the product, I wasn't sure when I ordered.I did a lot of research on which seat to buy; for my first kid I got an inherited Graco seat.It worked well, but it reached the six-year max so we had to get rid of it.I will admit, I didn't talk to anyone I knew that picked the Maxi Cosi brand, but I think that is just because they are hard to come by in stores.But this one is WAY lighter and I really like the handle shape.I have read reviews of the "terrible sun shade" but it is honestly just like the one on my last Graco seat.Most moms I talked to picked their seat because of the seat pattern, and I'll admit, i had a hard time and went with the neutral black.I was worried that it would get really hot, but my husband pointed out that we hardly ever leave it in the car.I'll take the higher rating in safety anyday.The carrying case is convenient as well.And who could beat the price I paid $1.80!I bought the Ameda Purely Yours to have a pump at home so I can keep up my supply now that I work fulltime.The Purely Yours is not even comparable to the PIS.It is very noisy, with every suction there is a beep.I have ordered a different size horn to see if that is the problem, hopefully they should be in the mail today.In my opinion I wasted $160.I would rather just bring home my PIS every night.But now I am stuck with the Ameda.It takes me almost an hour to get 1/4 oz out of this baby - barely feel it pumping even on high.I just don't get all the great reviews (and I bought this based on these - which really chaps my behind...)Just for reference - I have TONS of milk (comes out on it's own and when lightly stimulated) I can actually manually express my breast milk faster and easier than this does - ridiculous.Although that way is a lot more work - but you gotta do what you gotta do when the product you purchased for the job seemingly won't.I'm off to buy hospital grade or another - haven't decided yet.This is a great pump.it worked a few times, then i was no longer able to get any milk.the motor worked, but there wasnt enough suction.(my other top pick was the medela swing).the only con (which is why i gave 4 stars) is it could definitely use a faster setting on the 'cycle' knob - i think that would help me achieve letdown faster.i manually get things started, then hook up to the pump and within 2 mins usually, i start producing.other than that, this is the perfect pump.i require a hard suction & i definitely get that with the ameda.i turn it about 75% of the way & the fastest setting to achieve letdown, then i slow it down & turn the suction down to about 25% for the remainder.since I EBF, i usually dont get too much milk, my baby is very efficient.off each side in under 10 mins.if i was exclusively pumping im sure i would get much more.this is super easy to clean.since it has the hygiene kit, no milk enters the tubes - perfect!I think that this is the cutest stuffed animal my little girl has.She likes it, but now at 6 months it is more for chewing on, just like her other toys.I think that it is for older children, only because they will actually appreciate it more.It isn't like my daughter is old enough to want to hug and squeeze the thing out of actually liking it.Do remember it is very small, and don't be disappointed that it is so small.I purchased this hamper in Green Stripe.The hamper is made of a canvas type material.The handles are very sturdy.I purchased these storage boxes in the green stripe color.My changing table just has 2 shelves under it and it was very difficult to keep it clean and organized.Another one hold diaper rash cream, petroleum jelly, etc.They are so handy and I know where everything is at rather than having a pile of items to sort thru!I bought this back in June when I was 6 months pregnant, I expected it to fit my carseat since there was nothing on Amazon or JJ cole website saying any exluded baby seat types.Well it doesnt fit in my car seat and its way to late to return it.I guess this is what I get for assuming that this product would fit.It is terrible.Also the zippers will not go up after I take them down.It took 5 people to try and get them to go back up.I will not recommend JJ COLE to anyone.So now Im stuck with this terrible product.We purhased this bundle me for our 12 month old.We live in Burlington where it gets quite cold and windy.It is now very easy to transfer him from car seat to stroller without having to remove or out back on his winter coat.It more than does the trick.She keeps nice and toasty:)  Seems a little bulky when you look at it at first, but it's easy to install (Graco Snugride)and you'll have little worries when you tackle the winter weather.Doubt we'll even need a coat with this get up.I purchased the Arctic and Urban in toddler size and would highly recommend doing the same for the amount of money you want to get more than one winter out of the product.For an infant probably you would have to go with the smaller ones.If using the Arctic and if the wind isn't bad she is comfortable as low as 25 degrees, but will pull the front cover up.I agree with the reviewer who compared the Arctic to a snow suit and the Urban to a coat.The only draw back so far has been the zippers are little tough on the Arctic but I think with time they will loosen up.From time of purchase I have received at least ten compliments on the looks and six others asked where I purchased, it looks as good as it works and it works as good as it looks!This is a good high chair and I did lots of research.I came out thinking that this one is good enough to have to pay more.First one I had was the very highly-reviewed Fisher Price Healthy Choice booster seat but I eventually realized that it didn't fit under the lip of our table so baby felt isolated and bored when he had to sit in it.I confess that the straps are too much of a hassle for me so I don't use them usually - hopefully nothing bad will happen to make me regret that - but I might if I had a different room setup and had easier access to the chair.The only problem I see with the chair is that, even though it's made so the tray is detachable, the instructions forbid you from using the chair without the tray.I think this is because there is a gap between the chair and the table when the tray is removed, and they fear that a baby's arm could get stuck in it.This is regrettable because I'd like to have him be able to play with things directly on the table, as well as have him play in the chair when I'm washing the tray.But overall, I'm very happy and so's he.One final word of caution - about your table, not the chair.Once he started sitting in this seat and kicking his legs around in delight all the time, it loosened up the screws of the table to the point where it was really dangerous.I finally figured it out and since tightening the table screws, we have not had a problem.It works well for restaurant use especially if you are paranoid about letting your kid sit in a highchair other kids have set in.It works well for putting over a bench seat.I was always afraid to put the baby at the end and have the waiters handing hot food over her head.It is a pain to clean, but most of the time you can just wipe it down with baby wipes.It's taking it apart to put it in the washer that stinks.Now that my kid is older I use the restaurant highchairs but I keep this in the car for emergencies.It does take 2 people who know what they are doing to set it up.If I go to lunch with the girls, I have to juggle baby and highchair.I had to hand off the baby to my friend so I could set it up.Sometimes one of the locks sticks and is a little tricky to fix.It's great to be able to take the chair with us everywhere we go and let our 9-month old daughter join us at the table.Most of the people we visit don't have high chairs handy at home, so having this chair with us ensures that I always have a place to put my daughter in when we eat.We even use it in restaurants so that we don't have to worry about our daughter mouthing dirty high chairs (especially when she was teething).I do that each time after taking my daughter out and it keeps the seat pretty clean.It might not leave the space squeaky clean, but my daughter isn't able to get anything out from there either so I don't worry about it.The clip on works great with thick tables, and so far we haven't had any problems fitting it to any table, even at restaurants.It's a good way to engage her from a safe distance.Other people love the fact that the chair allows our daughter to sit right at the table, and she usually takes up a seat at the table with her high chair.We include her in conversations and she seems to really enjoy it too.I would definitely recommend it.I like the idea of the attachable tray; this is great!However, I did not like the fact that you cannot store and carry the seat, unless you removed the arms which attaches the seat to the table.This is quite cumbersome; especially since I already have one from PreNatal which allows you to just fold the arms of the seat and store it in the carry bag and go.This is a really good bottle set and adequate for an infant.I did not gives it a 5-star because i personally find them huge.Don't get why they can't make smaller bottles for infants - the bottle looks huge compared to my baby's head and is double the size of the max ounces it holds.My 3 month old is at the point where she wants to hold her own bottle but this bottle does not facilitate that.Overall, I have no complains about milk flow, material of construction and the fact that it reduces my baby swallowing air while drinking so I still do recommend itI purchased these along with several other types of sippy cups because a friend told me it would take a while to find one that he would like.The name is a little misleading...I thought "soft" meant the spout would be squishy...more like a bottle, but it's really quite rigid.I will reserve complete judgement of these cups because I figure I'll give them another go when he's a little older, but definitely not a good cup to start out with.If you're looking for a good first sippy, my son really likes the NUK Learner cup with the silicone spout.Infact they use the same bottle and just add handles and a differnt shaped nipple.After two boys, I have spent way too much money on sippy cups.My second son didn't take immediately to this product.He left his marks on the spout but was not able to chew through it.Another reviewer mentioned the spout not lining up correctly.I think it was a defective product.I have had mine for three years and they line up fine.Now that they are a bit old they have started to move a little past the center line but not to the point of being an issue.One down side - if you have a child that likes to turn it upside down and bang it onto your coffee table it will drip.Not sure if this is a common problem or we are just the lucky ones.My recommendation is to ween your child on to this sippy from bottles.Be persistent.I just wish it was a bit bigger.It just seems like it would be more hygienic than the regular pillow.The cover is machine washable but what if the fluids soak through the slip cover?I have also purchased the deluxe slip cover to use with this pillow.It has not arrived yet so I can't comment on how it fits but I can't imagine why it would not.Excited to start breast feeding with this pillow once the baby comes :)If you kid loves to problem-solve and troubleshoot, this toy will engage!I am amazed at how it works and my daughter, who has been very fussy due to teething, absolutely loves it!It is definately the best soothing technique I have found!If you are looking for a product to make your and your baby's life a little easier for a very reasonable price, please try the MamaRoo!!Cindy ReichelNow that we've had this thing for 4 months (we do use it daily), the springs are creaking and you can hear them above and beyond any sounds.They creak the entire time the thing is on, like an oil metal mattress.This knockec it down one star; if I do'nt get a replacement, I'll update again.Original review: We had this mamaroo waiting for our son and first sat him in it when he was just a few day's old.He's two months now.I agree with all the other reviewers who have said this is too slow.It's completely true.So we have to pick him up when he is fussy, but he loves this machine .It's his little home away from us.I can even set him down and he will play and look around by himself and he is very content and feels safe and happy in this thrown as we call it.Half the time we don't even bother putting the motion on.And he can't tell the difference between any of the different movements.My son isnt into the super slow speeds of this seat.The toy bar hangs way to low, its about 5 inches from my sons face, so we dont use it at all.Im upset I spent so much money for something that it hard, moves so slow & toys are to close to his face to useFYI about the speed: My son was 9 lbs 8 oz at birth and currently 14 lbs 4 oz at 8 weeks old and it has always moved to slowOur 3 month old daughter has reflux and needs to sleep in a sitting up position.We had tried bouncy seats and other swings then came across the Mamaroo.I did find the fabric a bit stiffer than the softer swings.I ended up putting a JJ Cole Bundle Me over the Mamaroo so our daughter wouldn't kick off a blanket in the middle of the night.Since having the Mamaroo our daughter has been gaining weight on a steady basis.Considering that we let it run for 6+ hours at a time it seems to be reliable.I like the smooth motion and right after we got it assembled (which was easy) our daughter fell asleep 2 minutes after we put her in it.The ease in which we assembled and disassembled this product was like no other product before.The makers thought of everything and make it very simple.The design was great, looked beautiful in the room.But unfortunately the motions were too slow for our baby to be soothing and she would sit in it for 5 minutes max before crying.We then got a simple graco swing - despite the fact that we didn't want to go for that look - and she loved it.The high speed on the swing was a life saver and put our baby to sleep.So we returned this.The seat was also too slippery and offered not much support.This worked well for a recent trip on my own with an active 18 month old in the airport.The only complaint is similar to others listed that the chest strap does slip up and does not stay in place.I've had this since my daughter was about 4 mths, she is now 8.5 months and has no interest in it.She loves washcloths and hard items to chew on so I figured she would love this but it was a complete waste of money for us.I was trying to find this product everywhere.Price is little expensive, but good to use.THis is the best source I have found for buying these in large quantities.We were looking for ones just like the ones they give out at the hospital.Our child preferred those.She was not formula fed, but the ones from the hospital fit on top of my medela reusable frozen milk storage bottles, and she seemed to like the shape and feel of these better than the more expensive ones available (or she did until she got older anyway)Very cute gave as a gift for a shower so I can't say if it works well or if the baby likes it yet.My 4-month-old niece came over to my house the other day.She started teething a few weeks ago and her parents have tried all kinds of teethers.They only found one that she would even entertain the notion of - [Kids Preferred Classic Pooh Flat Blanky Teether, 0-36 Months.She flatly refused any and all teethers, preferring to gnaw on her hand instead.That was until I gave Phillips Avent Range Front Teether to her.She put the top part of the toy - the "head" - inside her mouth, and then proceeded to chew on the circular part of the toy throughout the day.At the end of the day, the child was seen with the teether as a fashion accessory - she had put it on herself as a bracelet all by herself.Two weeks later, she refuses to be separated from it now and it's still the only teether she will consider chewing on.This is just a simple ring with a knob on the end.But it seems to do the trick.The teether isn't made of hard plastic.. it's another material that is firm, but has just a little give.A look at the Philips website doesn't give any information about what it's made of, except that it's BPA free, etc.Anyway, this is definitely worth the money.I plan to get the one for the middle teeth when it's time.The package says it is designed best for front teeth teething and I agree with this simply because the way it is designed it would be very difficult to get back far enough into the mouth for back teeth teething.I would definitely recommend this product.Our baby is just starting teething (5+ months) and we were excited to give this thing a try.He loves putting things in his mouth these days and this was no exception.I think it's a bit too hard for for him right now though, as he seems to prefer softer things.She took to it quickly enough and seemed to enjoy it.Our daughter started teething about a month ago and we've been going through a LOT of different teethers.The Philips Avent animal teether is great!It is made of a soft "silicone" like plastic, well shaped for early teethers with little hands and a harder time hanging on to things.I love that it is BPA free and easy to clean.I have no idea what kind of animal this is supposed to be but of course our daughter does not seem to mind!UPDATE:  At 9 months of age this is still one of my daughter's favorite teethers.The ring is easy for the baby to grab with one or two hands.Today this definitely is his favorite toy.My brother's baby loves this toy and seems to prefer gumming it over his other, more complicated and flashy teethers.All in all, a good product from a reputable company.I found it does pick up lint if just tossed into my diaper bag so I try to keep it and other teethers in ziplock bags to keep them nice and clean, and a quick rinse (which you should be doing anyways to sanitize) isn't hard to do.I look forward to purchasing more items from this company!As a new parent, I am surprised at home many baby things are hard plastic.This is softer than I expected and that's good.He gums it and the bumps seem good for massaging the gums.Overall this is a good teether.BPA-Free is good!This is my daughter's favorite teether, from the time she started teething.You can throw it in the dishwasher to clean it.I bought a second one so I can put one in the car, and leave one at home.She is constantly using it and it is the only toy that goes with us everywhere.This is my third child and I have used many teethers and I am so impressed by this teether we will certainly be buying the "stage 2 - side teeth" teether once her front teeth break through.This is my fourth child and although I have teething rings around from well-meaning friends and family, I am leery of the plastics used to make them.You will not have to worry with this BPA-free teething ring.This ring is supposed to be specifically designed to work for the front teeth as they are erupting.When I hold the ring for my son, I make sure to rub that part on his gums and he likes it.The ring has a good feel to it.He like to hold this more than any other toy he has currently.I feel good knowing he is putting something in his mouth.This is the only teether my four month old likes!We've tried different ones as well but this one is a home run!Bought this based on the reviews... and I'm so happy with the product!We have tried a few of the chilled ones (that has water inside) .. and they were still too big (an possibly too hard) for him.This brightly colored ring (with some unknown animal) is easy for small hands to grab and aids in soothing teething pain and helpful for massaging sore gums.What does BPA-free mean?That Phillips Avent has taken FDA warnings about the harmful effects of Bisphenol A seriously - BPA is typically used in plastic containers and resin linings of cans and can cause health problems.Thanks Phillips Avent for taking the initiative and removing harmful chemicals from this product.The combination of the usefulness, price and chemical free makes this a MUST HAVE product for all families.So far my 9 month old has really taken to this teether.I like that it is BPA-free and soft and chewy, we have mostly wooden teethers now to avoid issues with plastics.I would recommend this product to other mothers for early teething.I handed it to our 5-month old and she immediately yanked the teether out of my hand, inserted it into her mouth and started gumming it.Thus, I think it works as advertised and is recommended!Naturally this means we want toys around for her that she can grab onto, hold easily and that won't hurt her gums or the teeth she will eventually get.She doesn't seem to mind it in her mouth but she doesn't like the way it feels in her hand and when she'll hold other toys she immediately lets go of this one.It need much more frequent rinsing than other toys we've tried.As long as you and your baby don't mind that factor I really do think this is a great product and look forward to seeing it in action when the teeth finally do decide to start cutting.Now if only they'd make a couple more colors and designs...UPDATE: Teething has finally begun in earnest!It is now her favorite and I have to make sure it goes everywhere with us.At 5 months she has a canine coming in which is really giving her a hard time as a first tooth but this teether is definitely helping out with the discomfort.I'll probably have to buy a second one to keep in the diaper bag in case we forget it on an outing.My 4 month old really likes this teether.I would say that this particular teether would be better suited for a younger baby rather than one older than 6 months, only because of the size, and the fact that this is more for the front teeth.I had planned on just using this item as an alarm clock for my son so we can get him up on time without making him mad at me for waking him ~ a bit of a crank when woken, if you know what I mean!He has never gotten out of bed and run wild (knocking on wood), so I just liked the fact that "Mo Mo" is jungle themed like his room.!Only downside I see is that the eyes, as mentioned in other reviews, make a loud sound when opening.This has startled my little guy, but he likes the music and kisses Mo Mo so I think he is adjusting to it.the top where the baby will be placed is very thin plywood and makes me nervousi wouldn't buy it again if i knew it's so thin.Also the finish is bad and has bald spots.I gave it 3 stars for the good design.I've built a lot of furniture like this in the past, and this assembly was no more difficult than most others.Once assembled, the changing table seemed sturdy and looked exactly like the picture.There's lots of room for storage, and I like that everything isn't sitting out on a shelf, which could be both unsightly and a hazard once baby starts crawling/walking.)Long story short: It's a baby changing table.This changing table has a lot of storage and it assembled quickly and easily.They hold soooooo much.Our baby isn't here yet... but it is assembled, packed, and ready to go.I feel that it will work very well for our needs.Plus... for the price... it was a no brainer.These are very convenient - the material is super thin and folds down to nothing while staying waterproof.Unfortunately, the drawstring top leaves a small gap when the toggle closes all the way.It is ok for dirty clothes and wet diapers, but it will not hold in the smell of a stinky diaper.I could smell it from a couple of feet away!Also, I'm cautious about putting anything drippy in it, like swim suits.They contain the wet and the smell, look cute, and could hold two soiled toddler diapers or one soiled diaper and one soiled outfit (probably more of smaller sizes).Plus, you can't beat the price!I would absolutely buy again and again.Still look like the day I got them and they hold in the yuck very well.I still don't trust them in the diaper bag, I just use them for around the house, but compared to their much more expensive competition I think they are great!The drawstring being a hassle that never closes on first try can be a bit more annoying than one would think, considering closing these bags involves urine and/or poop.Not really something you want to mess with.Anyway, you can get a much cheaper option at a local sports store in the camping section (or on Amazon) -- only they call them "dry bags" or "ditty bags" or whatever.The vinyl is tougher, the drawstrings work every time.They aren't as cute but they work about 10 times better.I ordered this 2 pack to try because the price was so good.I have been using one for a few days when I leave the house and am amazed that there is no smell, even when it's open!It can hold probably 4 AIO diapers or several prefolds.I love those bags.I use disposables when I go out with the baby, but still wanted a reusable wet bag to carry baby clothes and burp cloths that get dirty.I bought these Kushies bags because they were the least expensive I could find.Don't expect a heavy-duty wet bag at this price.The drawstring on the large bag is held closed securely by a plastic grip.I use the little bag for pacifiers, because I don't like them rolling around loose in my bag.I'm planning to get a second set in a different color.I bought several of these bags and use them for transporting bottles, taking my pump to work, carrying soiled clothes in the diaper bag, etc.If you just want the larger bags, Amazon also sells a 2-pack that are both the larger size.Some folks complained about how small the 2nd bag is.I ordered two of these at $5.99 per set.That means I paid $11.98 for two large bags plus 2 pacifier bags, which IMO is a better deal than the $10.99 large bag 2-pack.I wanted a way to hold pacifiers, and at $3-$8 each, I thought pacifier cases were the biggest ripoff.The blue and the green neutral prints are really cute!I'm buying more of these sets for my pregnant sister and cousin.Only problem is that the small one is so tiny that I don't see what I could use it for...A must for any child who loves Mickey Mouse.After using this plate with our toddler about 3 months and lightly microwaving his food in it, the plastic has bubbled over time.It is now at the point that small pieces of plastic are sticking to his food.We threw it out last night (a 3 month plate).I use this with the Munchin mirror.This mirror is useful when I am sitting as a passenger and don't want to turn my head around to see my little one :)Definitely the better option!The idea of this mirror is awesome, the mounting mechanism is great.The downfall of this product is the mirror itself...it's very low quality.It's so blurry and almost like a funhouse mirror...it's pointless.If it was a clear mirror, it would be great.But it's such a poor quality that it's pointless to even use it.Too bad, the idea is a great one!I was looking for another child view mirror to replace the one I was using (an Eddie Bauer one from Target).The previous mirror allowed for forward/backward and side-to-side adjustments based on a hinge and swivel set-up, but the forward/backward hinge wore out after a few months; whenever I would accelerate or brake while driving in normal conditions (i.e.no jack-rabbit starts or short stops), the mirror would swing forward and backward and my son would no longer be in view -- annoying, needless to say.This mirror works great for us.It was super easy to install and once I have the mirror set to where I want it, is rock-solid.While its reflection isn't crystal clear, it is more than clear enough and is on par with all the other safety mirrors I have seen and used.Just bought another one for my second car.This cup doesn't leak, my daughter can get her hands around it and she loves the spout.Has a really good flow, doesn't drown her and she doesn't have to suck super hard either.My 17 month old son loves the soft spout.However once he figured out that he can poke his finger through the breathing hole on the top and flip it over and squeeze all the liquid out, that was the end of this cup, now I am stuck with cleaning up a mess every time.I gave it three stars because overall this is a good cup, it is user issues more than anything we are having, still I want a cup that is leak proof so when I leave my son in the crib with it he won't make a mess!Can't do that with this cup!UPDATE: he stopped pokin his fingers through, so now these work great!However, over the last month my son (who recently turned 16 months old) has chewed a piece of the straw off completely twice, and put holes in the top of the straw on two other occasions (luckily I was able to snatch the cup away before he totally chewed through the straw).Now that my son has chewed through 4 tops I can't imagine even replacing it, because I feel it's not worth the risk my precious little one would choke on a plastic piece.So, I am disappointed because I didn't get a lot of safe use out of these cups before the problems began.Still debating whether to contact the manufacturer and see what they have to say.Again, here is my original review:I bought a few sippy cups with straws from BRU and ended up hating them -at first they seemed ok, but they were hard to clean and soon broke, my son kept tossing them on the floor and I figured out it was because he could hardly get any liquid to come out of the cup (believe Tommy Tippee was the brand, not sure if I have the spelling right).I actually threw away the straw pieces for those cups, and just put a regular disposable straw in at meal time, the only reason I continued to use them at all was because it helped keep my son from sticking his hands in the cup at meal time.For this reason, I didn't even open these cups at first which I had ordered from Amazon, I thought they'd probably be just as bad.They work great, really easy to drink from, and they don't make a mess unless the little plastic top gets moved out of place (it has notches that need to be aligned in 3 places).I don't mind letting my 13 month old toddle around the house with these cups, and he drinks much more water because they work so well, it is helping us totally eliminate his bottle.I have 1 yr old twins, they learned how to use these cups at 11 months!The only down side...If you leave the cup out (of the fridge for awile) after you pour cold liquid in it, the liquid comes out the straw.... something to do with pressure I guess.Anything my breastfeed baby likes gets a thumbs up from me since she's quite picky.She does prefer the soothies, but these are easier to have on the go since I can clip them to her clothing w/o fear of them dropping somewhere.I only thought to try these since Nuks are the only bottle she will take.It's a cover, it works.Like any brest friend cover it's impossible to get on, but that's the price you pay for such a perfectly shaped pillow.I was dissapointed, however, at how thin the material was.You'd think for the price it would be a bit nicer.I also like that the size of these are a little bigger than the basic ones, so we will be able to use these a little longer.I think he found it so soothing because there are so many textures to be found on the teether.Though it looks like it's made of hard plastic, it's actually a very soft silicone.Unfortunately, this was recently dropped and lost while we were out on a walk.I was looking for the Sophie giraffe teether at Goore's but they were currently out of stock, but I wanted something that might have a similar feel to it for my son--the several wooden teethers he has don't seem to soothe him very well.If I put it next to a bunch of other very colorful and fun-looking teethers he will always reach for this one.If your baby doesn't seem to like the harder teethers this may be one to try.I recommend this teether to any mother with a teething baby.I absolutely love Ju Ju Be products!They have thought of everything!Plus it also makes a great little lunch pale for mom as well.I have the BFF bag, and it fits nicely inside, but might be a little snug in some of the smaller Ju Ju Be bags.But it has a clip, so it could be attached to any other diaper bag/sack or to stroller directly.See Ju Ju Be's website for videos and descriptions of the inside of the wallet!The only con with this Fuel cell tote, is that I wish they had insulated it exactly like the bags with the 3M insulate so you wouldn't always need an ice pack.The Ju Ju Be Fuel Cell Insulated Bag is a saver.This bag is a good size for a few sippies and some cheese sticks or small container of yogurt.However, it is not the best in terms of insulation for cold beverages - either be sure to use an ice pack with it or understand that the insulation lasts only 2-3 hours tops (much less in hot weather).I appreciate the top zip compartment, which I use to store handwipes and napkins.Other than the mediocre insulation, it is a nice multi bottle bag.When the weather is warmer, I reach for my Skip Hop Triple Bottle bag instead since it seems to provide better insulation and can be worn as a backpack or shoulder bag (this bag must be carried by hand or placed in another bag).It is pretty, but better insulation and a shoulder strap would be nice.As  a new mom, I was nuts about SIDS.It doesnt help that my cousin did actually die of SIDS at around 6 months, so my husband and I are big monitor freaks.We own the Angelcare system and it works a treat.But when we go to travel or when our little one is lounging and sleeping ouside of her crib the Snuza is the answer!!* Dont worry about other electical voltages if you go overseas(dont need to plug anything into the wall)* totally portable, can be used anywhere* lets you know with yellow light if the virbating function came on while baby was wearing*alarm is loud...you WILL hear it if it goes off.His knees will be hitting the underside of the table.So check if this fits your child and table before purchasing 2)Like another reviewer mentioned, the seatback is not tied to the back of the chair, so the seat back keeps falling forward.You may do some sewing and add some kind of easy mechanism attach the seatback to the chairback.But that takes time.This is probably an excellent product for smaller/shorter child before age 2.I got this for my older son knowing he is a fidget/wiggle type of kid.Very useful product!Our son is much more comfortable in it than the wooden high chairs most restaurants provide and it is also much more sanitary."My daughter-in-law received the Diaper Genie as a shower gift, but opted to return it for the Diaper Champ because it does not require special, expensive bags.It's been great--no odor or mess.Easy to clean.They've saved a lot by choosing the Diaper Champ."It's no longer odor-free!Yes, having the diapers go through the channel with the lid on top helps, but when they created the new design they lost that 'lock' the old version had that prevented odors from coming back up through the channel.This one also does not hold as many diapers as the old version did.This one is supposed to hold up to 30 diapers, and 30 is a stretch.Although with the odor issue, it's best to change out the bags 2-3 times a week, so the limit on diapers isn't such a bad thing.Bottom line - if you can find an original version, GET IT!!It worked flawlessly for me for two years, no odor, no mess, very easy to use.If all you can find is the 'Deluxe'.... try out a different brand.I registered for this pail over the diaper genie because not only was it less expensive than the genie, but the biggest issue was that I could put ANY bag in it.I use leftover thicker grocery and store bags most of the time so actually I don't really pay anything.It works just fine for disposing of diapers (especially the early morning full ones) without smell.It does need to be changed after a week, but in all honesty, it's really heavy when I do change it so I couldn't imagine it being much bigger.It'd be more hassle to clean up a busted bag of dirty diapers in my house than to just remember to take it out with the trash on garbage day.If he didn't have it, his room would stink.Also, I like the fact that it keeps diapers out of reach of other kids or pets.This is a great product for holding in the smell.BUT...it fills up quickly and then it get stuck when you try to put in another diaper.It fills up within a couple of days, wish it was taller to last at least a week.Maybe even have a foot pedal.But at least it holds in the smells.i do have the older one.i got it as a gift for my first son who i used plastic disposable diapers with.it worked fine i suppose.pretty much any pail that says you won't smell the stink is lying, but still my problem with it was that if you didn't have the wipes IN the diaper they got stuck in the lid and you'd have to go in there with you hands to get it out (not fun).with my second son i cloth diapered and found that the diaper champ was certainly not good for it.not only were the prefolds too big for the hole, but everything (the prefolds, the cloth wipes, the covers) all seemed to get stuck while the lid was trying to "push" it through, meaning i'd have to open the top which is majorly top heavy and always closes on you before you're finished unloading it, and try to pull it through myself.needless to say, pretty gross.so i stopped using it altogether and it's been sitting in a closet while i've waited to give it to someone to use with their plastic disposables (though i wish everyone would look into the newer cloth diapers instead of adding literally thousands of poop filled plastic bundles to the landfill which will all be there for over 500 years).my husband even tried to re-use it for composting (which i thought was kind of a gross idea) and the top heavy lid makes it impossible.all i need is an air tight, or at least less stinky lidded bin and my cloth wetbag (a reusable and washable bag that doesn't leak to hold the dirty diapers before laundry day).and if you're grossed out by the idea of dunking poopie diapers in the toilet the bumgenius diaper sprayer is a must have!bumGenius Diaper Sprayer tada!with no landfill needed.(p.s.the myth about water use making up for the money you save buying less diapers is just that... a myth.Hey, I didn't pay for it, so I would try it.It works OK. My son spends about 1/2 of his time in his room and the other half downstairs, so it gets only about 1/2 the diapers every day.I change it every week B4 the trash is collected, and a couple times a week I have to kick it a little to resettle the diapers to make more room.I leave the handle turned down to keep more smell in and every time I put a new diaper in I get a slight waft of stinky diaper from it.It definitely has some design flaws that in my opinion could be easily fixed.I wish now that I would have returned it and taken the money to purchase the original version from Ebay.Skip this!!You can smell it a mile away!You have to empty it to much!If you buy it make sure to get scented bags and change it often.I left it go for 3 days and there were bugs flying around it!!I used it for 2 weeks and it is in my garage!PROBLEM #1:It doesn't completely hold in diaper odors.Every time you open the lid, you get a whiff of all the diapers that have been stewing in the container.PROBLEM #2:The bags are cumbersome to insert & replace.PROBLEM #3:The flip handle will jam once half of the container is filled so you have to constantly open the container to unjam the handle or replace w/a new bag.***update***It's now 6 months later and we still use this.We still have the same problems as listed above -- we now use regular garbage bags instead of the refill bags.It still only holds about 20 diapers before it reaches the limit and it only keeps odors contained as long as you don't open it.Sorry for yelling, but it is the most annoying toy ever made.You cannot turn off the sounds, and it is really loud, and it plays following every tiny movement - it starts paying even if you so much as walk in the vicinity of the toy.There is no cause and effect learning, because the thing never stops.If you make a mistake of giving it to your child in the car or in stroller, be ready to listen to annoying two tunes and two sounds non-stop your entire trip.Love this toy!Soothing, soft music when it plays.Many interesting fwatures for my babues to discover.My 7 month old absolutely LOVES this toy.He plays with it all the time.The suction cup works great and he bats at it like a wild thing, and gets very excited every time the music goes off.That being said, there are a few minor flaws.So much so that just walking past it causes enough vibrations to set it off.The second issue is that because the music goes off all the time, the battery died after one month.I couldn't figure out how to change it, so I called Sassy 616-243-0767 and the told me the battery was not replaceable, but they'll send me a postage prepaid envelope, I'll send the toy to them, and they'll send it back to me with a new battery.Seems like a lot of expense on their part, but not much downside for me except being without the toy for a few days.Update:  after having the replacement for a month, the battery again died.I thought about just getting rid of it but my son loves it so much, I called Sassy again and they are sending me another free replacement.I don't know how they can possibly make money on these things, but you certainly can't complain about their customer service.I just bought a second one and am wondering what pics I'll put in it.Maybe numbers, animals, words?No idea yet but I'm looking forward to figuring it out!He also likes to chew on the handle (the black part of it is sort of rubbery).Thumbs up for this, I actually got this product because it was eligible for free shipping with other items if your order was over $25, but it turns out that it's a beautiful educational toy.It's a lovely product, and i would very much recommend it.I also think most of the Sassy brand products are creative and are worth the money.I loved sending it to my day care provider when I went back to work.Not too many toyss out there like this and very good quality too!This is very cute and attaches well to the car seat handle.I wanted a mirror to take in the stores to keep my daughter occupied but she doesn't seem to have any interest in this.Maybe she will when she is a little older.I have a 2005 Trailblazer and there isn't a middle headrest on the back seat for a mirror.I keep it on the handle of his Graco SnugRide32 carseat and have not had any issues with fit.It also sits up on floor easily for your little one to use for tummy time.This is a GREAT mirror.We use ours as a stand alone on our baby's play matt.Our baby is very young and can't yet sit up.This mirror props up in such a way that it doesn't lean back too far like some of the other mirrors.It's GREAT for that reason.Some mirrors lean back so far that the baby has to be able to sit up to see themselves.The problenm is with the fabric that connects the two sides of the mirror together.The product that is shipped has fabric that fills in the space between the two sides.This causes this product to topple over easily because you cannot open the mirror up to a large enough angle.It is constantly falling over.As for the mirror itself, it is simply a funhouse style mirror that stretches and contorts your baby's face in all directions.I am left wondering what sort of developmental effect this actually has on a child.Our baby loves looking at himself in a real mirror when we hold him up to it.Unfortunately, he is not as enthusiastic about seeing himself in this mirror.True, picture is misleading in that it looks like there's a gap between the two boards.Somebody wrote that their toy detaches but mine doesn't... my baby is constantly trying to pull the bumblebee off!My babies loved this from the time I gave it to them.Keeps them engaged and as they develop they tend to find it more and more interesting.I give it 4 stars because I feel the music is too loud and does not sound soothing in my opinion.It is heavy and is not flimsy.Overall good buy especially since they come as a package and the sounds.Only con is that the corners and edges are somewhat pointy and sticks the baby gums when she places it in her mouth.The block is all cloth, which is what I expected the book to be.Not a great idea that the books are made of plastic!This is a HORRIBLE set of books!The quality is fine but the phonics are wrong!The letter "m" does NOT say "ma," it says "mmmmmm."Each letter represented (m, b, and d)are followed with an "a" on the pronunciation page, meaning your child is learning how to say each letter incorrectly.I realize that some people won't care but as an elementary school teacher who deals with kids struggling to pronounce sounds correctly, I find this set of books to be the epitome of worthless.Cute set, but smells super toxic.I washed them a few times, but the books still smell horrible.Enter this adorable set of chew-friendly books to save the day.Despite the set's title, the books do not make sound; I thought they may moo or make music when pressed, but this is not the case.The cube that comes with the book set jingles a bit but that is it.The cube is a fabric-covered foam block that encases a jingle bell; since it is slightly muffled by the foam it's not annoying to adult ears.Each book covers a different sound: ma-ma, da-da, and ba-ba.We started using them when she was 8 mos and she would mimic the sounds.The books are short enough, to read over and over for repetition in a single sitting.I keep these attached to my son's car seat to occupy him while I'm driving.This was a last-minute add-on purchase.Frankly, I bought it because it was cheap.My 7-month-old grandson adores it!I wanted a fill and spill toy that didn't require shape sorting because of his age.The barrel contains plush stuffed monkeys, little plastic barrels, and plastic bunches of bananas.For some reason, Alex likes the bananas best.The concepts of "in" and "out" are easily taught with fill and spill toys, and makes for great interactive play with an adult.An unexpected plus in the lid, which features a fold, down handle.Alex loves playing with it, too!I spoil this little guy rotten, and it's amazing to see how much he enjoys this simple, basic toy.Let me start by saying that my son really likes playing with this.I am a little frustrated with it though.I bought this because I wanted a suction toy that would stick in place so I wouldn't have to constantly be picking up toys and putting them back on his high chair tray....but this doesn't stick very well.There are times that I've stuck the toy to the high chair and it loses suction and falls over on its own without even being touched *grumble* so you can imagine how easy it is for my baby to just grab it and pull it right off the tray....only to drop/throw it on the floor soon after, defeating the purpose of this toy...So yes-it is very cute and fun for the baby to play with.However, if I had known it was going to just end up being another noise making toy with moving parts, I wouldn't have bothered buying it.The music is annoying and loud and constantly goes off with little provocation.I imagine it won't last long.Baby did seem to like it.Lots of pieces to grab and play with.My big beef is that I got it because it would stick to the highchair and so I would not need to stop eating to pick it up for him.(We sit baby in chair with toy while we eat.)But the base does not hold toy firmly enough and he yanked it off with very little effort.Especially since he tries to get it in his mouth, it came off too easily.Update: He mouthed it a lot.So after a while the music stopped playly.At first, I thought, thank God.And the water from mouth had gotten into battery compartment and actually corroded battery.That freaked me out.I have since seen this toy in store and it now has two balls instead of a ball and music piece.So, I suppose, that is why.I got this for my son when he started using a high chair but he pulled it off of the base the first day.I finally gave up trying to keep it in the holder (which would also lose suction and wouldn't stay put) and now just use a link to clip it (without the base) onto his stroller and or shopping cart cover.They really should put an ON/OFF switch on these things.Duh.Anyway, the internal battery finally ran out so now it doesn't play the sounds anymore BUT, since my son still enjoys playing with it, I find that the lack of (annoying) sound is a good thing :)As an adult, this toy is ok, but my 4 month old son likes it so....You have to be sure you have a dab of water on the suction cup for it to stick and not be pulled from the table surface.When it 'feels' movement the white dots light up an eventually go off when movement stops.It is pretty sensitive, which is good, on the other hand in the diaper bag the light comes on with every movement, though probably not enough to run the battery down.Granted my daughter is only 6 months old now and cannot play with this toy yet - but my husband and I can!On the rug (depends on the type/thickness), hardwood, or tile you will get this car to go!Thought my LO would love this toy.He loves cars and trucks but this toy does not seem to interest him.As another reviewer said, it is much smaller than I thought it would be.It is a push back car which is nice, but the poppers do not pop as expected.If the price is between $3-4 go for it.For $6 it is overpriced.My 3yr old winds it back and lets it go, and my 9 month old crawls after it.It even rolls on low-pile carpet pretty well.Fun little car!Nice little basic toy.You pull back on it and it goes forward making the balls pop.It doesn't have any paint on it, so you don't have to worry when your baby starts chewing on it.I got this for my daughter who isn't able to walk and push yet.Overall a good buy, especially since they come as a package.Only con is that the corners and edges are somewhat pointy and sticks the baby gums when she places it in her mouth.liquids... no problem!I have one, which lasts a long time, I just wash it off after meals, but when he throws up in it I wash it in the washing machine and hang it to dry.The one we have is handed down and is still in great condition, but I'm buying another so we can just forget about all the cloth bibs we've been using since my son was born because he's now eating like a big boy.A friend gave us the first one and we just love it!Not sure why they don't put the same coating on the back portion too!Overall a great bib and would recommend.I wish all the toys I've bought the baby would get as much use as this one.She's used this regularly since she was very young (one of her first grasping toys) and it's still a hit at 7 months as she is more into the mouthing and rattling features.Keep up the good work, Green Sprouts!He also holds the ring and shakes it to rattle the keys together.Great toy and love that it's non toxic!I purchased the other 2 toys that go along with this toy too.I feel good knowing that he is not putting harsh chemicals in his mouth with this toy.I liked them so much I purchased more to give to a friend who is expecting.I gave this as a gift and the 3 month old hasn't used it much yet, but I was unhappy to see it was made in China, another teether i bought from them was made in Germany so I assumed :(This was the first teething toy my baby likes!My 4-month old will hold these all day!Each key is a little different in terms of the chewy teether placement.I was afraid of nipple confusion for the baby as I sometimes supplement, but there have been no issues.My baby is 2 months old and easily eats from both the breast and the bottle when mom is not around.Definitely recommend!They are big enough to catch most daiper blow outs or mid-change piddles.They mean I have to change the plush cover much less often.I more recently started using them in my eldests car seat as she went through potty training.They work well to cover most of the seat and are long enough to pull up around the crotch strap and wide enough to keep big accidents contained...they've saved the seat LOADS of times!We got the Boppy cover, and the liner was too small.So we ordered the Muchkin's pads.The key with these is not to throw them out when using them unless they become soiled.You can definitely get your money's worth provided you do not throw them away every time you use them.Only throw them away when they get soiled!They are like Viva paper towels with a thin plastic backing.The smaller ones helped me avoid messes on my diaper bag's pad which I appreciated when I was out.The larger ones have saved me from washing my table cover as often.They were all that I could find at Target so I bought this brand, and have gone back for more often.Now, I see a cheaper kind so I am going to try them.I reuse these so the price was not a big deal.I do not throw them away with one use if it is not visibly dirty.But, anyway they usually run 60 cents apiece so I am trying other cheaper brand.You can buy all the toys you want for you baby (as I do) but they will never get tired of stacking and unstacking these cups.I like that they are bpa free.They are made of safe plastic, so I feel good knowing that when these end up in his mouth, he is not ingesting harmful chemicals or residues.Great toy!They are smaller compared to the ones you usually see in stores.However, he manipulates them very well.He loves to bang them together, stack them inside each other, and just plain chew on them.Since they are free of so many nasty chemicals, I am so glad he can enjoy them without me worrying about them!I recommend them!My 9-month old adores these cups, she plays with them all the time.They nest and stack.I do not have problems stacking them (except when she's right there to knock them over).She loves putting these in her mouth and is constantly chewing the rims of these.Highly recommend Green Sprouts.Great durability and great toy.They will be great for the beach this summer as the bottom has holes in it.Great for outdoor pools, bathtubs, water tables, sand box, sand tables or to just roll around on the floor and stack.Also the bottoms have shapes on them to use with playdough later on which is nice too!UPDATE- My child is 25 months old and still uses these in the bathtub, beach, sand and water table.I am so impressed by these I plan on buying more for friends in family as baby shower gifts.How many toys can you say your child has used at least once a week since they were 8 months old to now 25 months old, not many!I have lost a few but I would buy these again and again!when they are out at our house, other babies much older, and younger than she, are drawn to these and love to play with them also.we have not put them in the bath yet, but will.so far, they've served as a great toy even without using in the tub.good buy, and i love knowing they are green and safe when she's teething on them.I bought these because they are nontoxic plastic, but wasn't sure if my 5 month old would be interested in them.They're the favorite toy right now by far.When I take these to our play group all of the babies reach for them!When she was ready for toys, we went straight to duckies.She liked to suck on the duckies heads, but she never really played in the bathtub until we got these cups.These have different little holes in the bottom of them, so they sink, float, water drips out slowly, quickly, and she loves to run her fingers under the stream.At 9 months, now she's clapping them together and drinking out of them like a cup (oops!We have a few more toys that do similar things, but nothing beats the simplicity and versatility of these stacking cups.She can only take them apart and scatter them and then pick them up an stick them in her mouth, but this keeps her joyfully engaged.Her fifteen month old friend LOVES them.He likes putting them one inside another (total two- not the whole stack) and also arranging them (15-month old version).I can stack them, and I'm not concerned that small hands might not be able to make a complete tower!colors are nice, drainage holes are a must for bath, and they make good sounds when banged against each other.however they are difficult for children to stack.i can stack them with patience, but forget expecting a child to do.children will find many things to do with them regardless.My 5 month old loves them - mostly just throwing them around and putting them in his mouth for now!But they keep him busy and he gets bored very easily.A major plus that they are eco friendly and made in the US.wish i bought him stacking cups when he was younger, so now its helping him to sort of "catch up" on those.My son plays with them at every bath time.... they have little holes in different patterns in the bottom, so the water drains quite easily.I like that they are made with a "better" plastic.Love the concept of the product and even I have fun twisting and turning it.I took off one star because it's too hard for my baby to use as a teether.She'll chew on it, then cry because of the pain; not fun for either of us.She does have fun shaking and banging it around until that point.I've stopped giving it to her because of the crying (happened every time several times so it wasn't a fluke/accident).Maybe I'll try again later when the top teeth are out and she isn't just chomping down on the hard plastic with her bear gums.Overall, the colors are pleasing and the product seams well made.FYI, it's bigger than I thought it would be.I should have checked the size but didn't imagine it would be that big since it's a "teether."The thing is longer than the width of my baby's body.Makes it a little unwieldy.I purchased this rattle for my 3 month old daughter because it is BPA free and I am very impressed with its quality and versatility.The rattle sound is nice and soft like those waterfall toys; not a harsh, overly loud sound that so many rattles have.We like it just the same and plan to buy more products from Green Sprouts.It twists and turns and is just the neatest thing!I purchased the other 2 toys that go along with this toy too.I feel good knowing that he is not putting harsh chemicals in his mouth with this toy.I liked them so much I purchased more to give to a friend who is expecting.My three month old didn't care for this toy because it twists and untwists while he was learning to grasp and bring things to his mouth.The teething sections are still very hard plastic, with minimal texture compared to other teethers, and I find that my son will suck on this, but does bite it to teethe.It's a great rattle and hand-eye coordination toy though.My 5 month old took to this teether right away.He seems to enjoy that it has so many joints that it is twisting around as he chews on it.Glad I bought it.She can grip the handle well.She has a lot of fun shaking and banging it.Not so great as a teether since her hand covers most of the handle, the rings are too hard for sensitive gums and the ball ends are too big to bite (also too hard anyway).The ball ends also turn which makes the toy more interesting and fun for baby to play with.So thankful there are companies like green sprout out there.If the product were to ever spring a leak (highly unlikely), then I can have the peace of mind of knowing that the filling is not harmful.the safety factor).My baby likes this teether, and I like it because it doesn't have BPA.It's not as soft or as flexible as the Lamaze ring teether, which is very similar.However, the Green Sprouts Teether is still a good product.This is a good quality teething ring, the material feels as though it can really take a lot of biting.All in all, still glad to have it.I put it in the fridge and will give it to her when she starts to get fussy.It works well even when it isn't cold.Never leave home without it!In the beginning it was not a good toy because he had a lot of trouble grasping it.Now that he's 9-10 months, it's very easy for him to grab and move around.He plays with it for awhile but it's not a favorite.Also, because it's clear, it's not as visually interesting.Also note that because it is distilled water you can't put it in the freezer - just the fridge.&lt;follow-up> I accidentally put it in the freezer once!This teething ring is a little bigger, thicker & heavier than my regular teething pretzel ring.My 6 month old can hold on but not for more than a few minutes with one hand.Also, since it is quite thick, my baby's hands get very cold after holding this and sometimes that makes her not want to hold it.This was not an effective teething product.Both of our sons just looked at it blankly when it arrived.I showed them how they are supposed to put it in their mouths.To be fair, my kids prefer to stick dog food, electrical cords, and small plastic pieces from their age inappropriate toys in their mouths over any teething product my wife and I have ever bought.Except one; they do like the widely availableFirst Years Massaging Action Teether; I think it is the active feedback they get from that product.All of these other teething products are pretty boring, far more so than, say, my shoulder or that kid at daycare (sorry!).Edit: My wife has informed me that the kids have continued to occasionally stick this in their mouths.I guess that, as a teether, it is effective, contrary to my previous review.(I still have yet to see my oldest do anything other than point at it, lying forlornly on the ground, and ask "what's that?")I love Green Sprouts and am always excited to give one of their toys a try, but this one was not for us.I was surprised by how small and thin this product was.I see that there are a lot of positive reviews, and I like the company, so perhaps I am overly cautious, but for us, it was not a safe enough toy to leave with the baby and so we never got to try it out.I'll stick to the bigger non-toxic teething toys in the future.Perfect size holes for her little fingers and I love that I don't have to worry about the plastic.It can easily get lost so I recommend getting a teether leash (similar to a pacifier leash)My 16 month old really wants to self feed.Received this about a week ago and have used it for oatmeal and cereal and applesauce.It sticks to her tray like a rock and although she plays a bit with the spill catcher, still can't get the bowl off.Having the bowl fixed in place makes it much easier for her to scoop up the food with her spoon.Read the reviews that it doesn't do well in the dishwasher but as I'm using it pretty much every meal, I just handwash it.That's what we do with almost all plastic items anyway, including her bottles and pump parts back when we used those; I just don't trust plastic to hold up in a dishwasher's heat.We have a few other Boon items, including a cute bath toy.This bowl stays put no matter how my grandson tries to get it off, great suction cup holder!Quality as all Boon products!After trying theMunchkin Three Stay Put Suction Bowl 3-Packwhich DID NOT STICK AT ALL and the waaaay more expensive (although not technically a baby product)Large Sticky Bowlwhich DID NOT STAY STUCK AT ALL (although it did work as intended for keeping a bowl steady), I was about to give up hope.Then I tried the Boon Catch Bowl.And the bowl stayed stuck.Through lunch.With my 16mo toddler almost-constantly pulling at it (he knew he could get the other bowls off)./cue angels singingThat said, I don't yet see much use in the "spill catcher" part of it--maybe once my son starts eating with one hand more than the other...but for now, it's just more of a handle for him to play with.But I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND this bowl and am happy to give it five stars.P.S.Turns out the photo is WRONG--but the description says orange/blue--and you do get an orange/blue bowl.He likes to chew on it which does not make me nervous because it is pba free.Now if they made a slim one w/more contrast then that one might be perfect.It seems almost all bath toys - 'rubber' ducks especially - are made of PVC.So, while most of our bath toys are unconventional, we do have the obligatory vinyl ducks made by the untrustworthy company Schylling.When my daughter developed a strong attachment to our scary vinyl ducks and wanted to carry them all over the house, I figured it was time to pull Jane out and give her a try.She was an immediate hit: My daughter passed off all the old yellow ducks in favor of this brightly-colored, excitingly decorated alternative, and she's been carrying Jane around the house for days now.She's also been for a few swims in the bath without the leakage problem others have spoken of, so I guess we got lucky on that count.Which is pretty cool; you'll never find her doing that dead-duck-on-her-side thing.She has a rigid non-pliable head and beak, and her body is somewhat squishy, though less so than a traditional PVC duck.I noticed, on first opening the packaging Jane came in, an odd smell.Sort of like an uncapped Sharpie, and I immediately flipped her over to look for the recycling code.No details on what plastic she's made of on the packaging either.Luckily the smell faded, and I - who am extremely sensitive to smells - can no longer detect it.Consider that I'm paranoid, so that's actually a point in this toy's favor.I did, however, want to know what kind of plastic they made this toy out of since it is phthalate-free and PVC-free, so I asked.Boon ducks are made of Styrene Ethylene Butadiene Styrene (SEBS), a subtype of synthetic rubber that was created by the Shell Oil Company in the 1960's and is marketed under the trade name Kraton-G (there's actually a Wikipedia article on this).It's used in everything from tires to medical devices and gloves, and - of course - increasingly in toys as a PVC alternative.Its main benefit, of course, being that it is pliable but does not require the use of the dangerous plasticizers that are used in the manufacture of soft PVC.It is known to have a strong odor, as I can attest, but Greenpeace in a 1996 article stated it was a viable and safer alternative to PVC.It does seem to be a safer alternative - so far as we know at this time - though I'm surprised how little real data exists on it, whereas you can find a wealth of information on many more commonly-used plastics.The Material Data Safety sheet documents this plastic as a low hazard in all areas.While I don't think it's wise to trust a company (particularly one with China manufacturing - Odd Ducks *are* made in China, like most things) just because they say that a product is minus known toxins (not all alternative plastics are created equal), in this case the alternative seems to be an improvement over the current standard.The duck herself is sweet, and I'm glad to have a potentially less toxic option available, as bath duckies seem like one of those 'must-have' toys for little kids.I can certainly see collecting the others in the future, and would - based on all current information available - recommend these ducks to anyone wanting a safer bath toy for their children.**UPDATE**:We now own all the ducks (my youngest has taken a particular liking to them), and so I thought it would be worthwhile to comment on a few things.1.The best floaters are Jane (pink) and Slim (blue).The first Bob we ordered had completely separated from the weighted disk on his base during shipping.So anyone who hesitates on the premise they might get a faulty duck?Fear not.This is one company who will stand by their products -- and that is worth the extra money.Schylling) who I emailed about a defective product two months ago and *never* received a response from.I was looking for a nontoxic bath toy that didn't get moldy inside, like other rubber duckies.Sometimes when I shake it, I think I hear a little water in it, but it doesn't appear to leak out so I'm not too concerned - it's got to be better than the other squirties and rubber ducky toys.I would recommend this bath toy to others.Great rubber duckie if you're looking for one free of nasty chemicals, bpa, etc.I wish it were a bit softer or made a squeak, but I suppose then it would fill with water and collect mold.One of my daughter's first identifiable sounds was a "quack" sound she'd make at the sight of a duck.She fell in love with a bunch of rubber duckies her nana bought, but when she put them in her mouth the paint came off instantly.This officially freaked me out and sent me on a hunt for a safer rubber ducky.I'm also sensitive to smells and neither of the ducks had an odor when we took them out of the package.While this looks like my son would love it he never got the chance because it is being returned for a refund due to the poor quality of this toy.The stitching is so lose it looks like with a tug his head would promptly fall off and there are holes where you can see the stuffing and I just opened the package!So disappointed!As a busy mom the last thing I have time to do is return an item so that tells you just how poorly its made that I am taking the time to do so.The way they photograph this thing makes it look  more like a tiger than it does when you get it.When you get it it is longer and looks more like a bear with stripes.Other than that it should be fine...just kinda silly looking.So the teether ring isn't being used as the teether so much as the legs of the tiger.Just placed an order for th green bear... not sure whether my little guy will like it, but currently enjoys the tiger version.It's cute-- more of a safe stuffed animal for your baby to nibble on.It helped to have these on hand.They are soothing for the first minute or so and that is about it and if I wear them over night they fill up and then I have to replace them much sooner.I get more time out of them if I wear them in hour spurts here and there.They are probably the best gel pads out there and also probably the most expensive.i had cracked and bleeding nipples and this was the only thing that felt good!!i couldn't wait to put them on after nursing!they have the lansinoh cream in them so they help you heal!!I liked it because my nipples were really sore.I liked it more than the Medela ones because they are better shaped.The only thing is that they are extremely expensive, but if you are really sore they are worth itMy nipples were beyond sore they were bleeding and scabbed.This product was the ONLY thing that soothed the scabs and made them better.Super expensive and hard to find in stores but well worth it.I believe I reviewed this product on Amazon, maybe for another shell set/color.We loved the idea of an AI2, because really, it seems more green than an AI1 when you aren't constantly going through outer shells.At first, these worked great.We were thrilled.We only used Rockin Green laundry detergent or Charlie Soap and are always careful about tucking in the Velcro before washing and drying the covers by hand.Well, at 8 months, it all changed.My daughter's bladder could hold more and after a good pee, the diaper would leak.I cannot keep her in this diaper for much more than an hour for fear that she will leak everywhere.I unfortunately recommended this product to a few friends and they are all experiencing the same issue with their babies (all around 1 year of age).My daughter is now 10 months old and we have to put her in a disposable when we go out for a period of time (2 hours!)and I am extremely disappointed.It is too bad I only purchased this system.I do not want to spend money on a different system as she is in daycare most of the day and they don't let us use cloth there anyway.I will probably use it on future babies for the first few months and figure out what to do when they get older.I would love to say I can go 100% cloth from birth to 35 lbs, but unfortunately, it is not the case with these GroBaby diapers.I got this set because of the snaps, which could last longer than applix, and because the rise is higher, which would allow for bigger babies.They have been working well despite the soaker sticking out about half an inch in the front (when the cover is set to its smallest size).Why don't they just sew them together all the way around instead of just at the ends?But I do like how easy it is to remove/snap on the soaker into the shell - you just have to make sure it stays on straight and inside the shell when putting it on the baby.They are cute, and seem pretty comfy.As other reviewers have said, the soakers bunch (especially when wet) and the cover can get dirty pretty easily.Since our little one is still exclusively breast fed, there is no way to have a full poop in there that doesn't dirty the cover.I bought a 2-pack trial and as much as I love the covers, I don't think I can justify spending that much money on just covers.The soakers do take longer than anything else I have to dry as well.Edited to add Dec 2011:  Well, I love the covers a lot less now.They are a great, trim diapering option but the hook and loop closure really looses functionality after minimal wear.We have a large stash, so these were by no means regularly abused and washed (and we have had them for less than 2 years), but we can't put them on our now walking around 2 year old because they ends up opening up and falling down around her knees if her pants aren't holding it up and the diaper would not last at all if the pants weren't supporting it.I haven't tried the snaps, so perhaps that is a better option.We have been careful to take care of the covers and not use the dryer, etc.but they hook and loop just does not last.Too bad, because it is soft and cute.Why I bought it:I wanted to change to cloth diapering to save money, trips to the store, and reduce my family's amount of waste.Pros:With two kids in diapers, these definately cut down our diaper costs, they are very cute, one diaper could fit my new born or my toddler with the simple snap design.These are made with very durable construction.The snaps work well and the velcro holds tight.The inserts snap in holding them in place.They work very well with my infant daughter who sleeps on her back as the majority of the absorbant insert's padding is in the rear end.The shell prevents leaks very effectively.Cons:My toddler son is very active and the soaker pad tends to bunch up in an uncomfortable way in the front.The amonia smell from these soakers tends to be a lot stronger than other brands that I have tried.What I've done to make this product work better for my family:I mainly use these diapers for my infant since she is not as active.The soaker pads have a booster liner sewn on to them which adds to the bulk and doesn't really add much absorbtion, it also tends to bunch up, so I ripped it out.Pretty!Non-irritating velcro.They fold right over on themselves!4.If you have a skinny baby, the tabs will fasten on top of each other for a snug fit.5.Elastic in the liner.There is elastic around the legs to help hug the liner to your baby.6.Snap-in liners.No more bunching up!These liners snap right in to the shell.7.Slim in the middle.Cloth diapers are bulkier than disposables.Period.When our baby wears these, I can tell by the way she is walking.They are slimmer than the other AIO (all in one)'s we have tried and I really like that!What I would change:1.We have LOTS of "leakage" from the liner to the shell.We don't often make it through a day without going through at least 4 shells.Our baby is short and chunky.She may outgrow these before any of our other cloth diapers.Wing droop.With the velcro closures, there is nothing to hold the wings up - the part that is tucker under and around your baby's belly.With the snaps, this is addressed, but the velcro leaves some hanging wings on skinny babies.Our chunky baby doesn't have much of an issue with it, but it could be troublesome if your baby isn't full-figured.However, they take a lot longer to dry.They are soft when you dry them in the machine but stiff if hung to dry.To save energy costs, I usually hang them until they are almost all dry and finish them up in the dryer to soften them up.You need to inspect them before drying them to prevent stains from setting in.Since they are cotton, you can actually feel when they are wet (as opposed to fleece).On the other hand, having the moisture right next to the skin may lead to (or make worse) a diaper rash, so I would suggest getting some fleece liners as a moisture barrier, especially at night.I would hesitate before using it with newborns.The soakers stick out about an inch when the shell is snapped down to its smallest setting, which is not good for newborns who still have their umbilical cord stumps.I emailed the company, and they told me to fold the soaker down.Considering that the soaker would be almost an inch thick when folded, I decided to just let it stick up to avoid making baby uncomfortable.Also, I don't understand why there are two separated layers to this thing, a curvy pad and a straighter booster pad.Why don't they just sew it together all the whole way around instead of just at the ends?It just seems awkward and makes it harder to spray poop off it.I usually make sure to straighten it out as I put it on baby so she doesn't get too uncomfortable.UPDATE - Nearing 12 months, the soakers started having problems with mold/mildew.A couple of times I waited three days before washing and noticed orange spots appearing, and I've had to soak them for hours in oxyclean to get the mold/mildew out because the sun doesn't get them out very well.Afterwards, I had to do many extra cycles to wash it all out, which ended up making some holes in the cotton.These loads tend to be small as she only uses about 4 each day, so it feels quite inefficient.Not sure if it's very eco-friendly at this point.What sets these soakers apart from most of the other shell / soaker systems we have tried is that these not only snap in place, but have ELASTIC around the legs to help hug the liner to your babe.Even if the shell is a bit gappy (which we have not encountered), the liner will also fit snugly against baby's bottom to help contain blow-outs, keeping your shell cleaner through more uses.These soakers are sooo soft and they really do absorb a ridiculous amount of liquid.I love these things!these are much softer than the original soaker.He had been using his fisher price rainforest light up crib toy thing but since we are getting ready to switch him to a toddler bed I decided it was time for a regular night light.The light itself is perfect - Just the right brightness.The charge on it lasts a really long time since it switches itself off.We've had this light for almost a month and I've only had to charge it twice...and that is with a lot of use since he likes to play with it as well.It seems to be pretty durable in my opinion.I keep the charger up out of his reach.I would definitely reccomend this night light over anything else I have seen on the market.Aside from the price, my favorite thing about this sling is how easy it is to use.I want to note that the box used to say you could use it with newborns, but the company put stickers over top of that to hide it and added other stickers saying that its recommended for use with 4 months old and up.I can see why they did this, but it can be used with smaller babies, you just have to be careful and observant.The problem is that the baby can be in a dangerous position to cause positional asphyxiation.I keep an eye on her and it would not be possible for her to have any breathing difficulty or become in any way uncomfortable without me noticing.You do want to be very cautious and attentive if you are using this with a younger baby.I have the sling adjusted as small/high up as it goes and it holds my baby about as well as the sheet sling that I made myself, (I saw a video on Youtube that explained how to do that), but it is much easier to use.The reason I use this (and the reason I made the sheet sling) is because it puts her to sleep instantly, which is extremely helpful when she's fussy.Other slings that I have tried have been much more difficult to use.I really wanted something that I could just throw on and put the baby in, which this is perfect for once you get it adjusted the first time.I can also tell you that this is no more dangerous to her than any other carrier I've used.I can actually see her face better in this sling than I can in the others, so I feel that it is easier to ensure that she is breathing easily.I like that there is a seatbelt.Its similar to one you would find on a baby bouncer, only much softer and with strong Velcro instead of buckles.I also really appreciate the facts that this sling is adjustable and that it will be useful when she's older too.I read a review about the material being scratchy but I don't think it is at all.I don't like that the tail of the strap hangs so far and doesn't have anything to tuck into or pin it down, but you can wrap it around the part that is on your shoulder if its in the way or get a pin or something..The important thing is that baby calms down and/or falls asleep instantly when I put her in it.:) I am able to do just about everything I could do if I wasn't carrying her, including eating, shopping, dishes, and laundry.. and it doesn't get in the way the way my Ergo Baby Carrier does (It is definitely not convenient to eat with Ergo on).The only thing about this that makes me not regret purchasing the Ergo Baby Carrier (which is great too but is 7 times more expensive) is the fact that this sling does hurt my back if I wear it too long.So, if I were going to go for a long walk, I'd be better off with the more back-friendly Ergo... meaning that the more expensive purchase is still useful.lol.*I noticed that there weren't any pictures showing babies in the sling or mothers wearing it (aside from the box image), so I added some to help people get a better idea of how it looks and works.Once you figure out how to assemble the first piece putting the rest together was cake.Another plus the planes and clouds are plastic so they can easily be cleaned/dusted.Shipped to me fast with no issues even during the holidays.I bought this toy because of how cute and cheap it was.I love the toy, however the handle where the baby holds it at is kind of small and the rings make it a little harder for the baby to hold it.It's not the worse investment I've made, but it's not what I thought it was going to be.My baby is now 8 months old, and has used this for several months although now he really plays with it.Seems durable.It has been in and out of the freezer and fridge many times.My baby doesn't have much interest in this toy.Maybe he will later, he is almost 5 months now.My daughter is 7mos, she is starting to teeth and she loves this toy.The first teether my son used was the sophie the giraffe which is cute, but more like a chew toy for puppies.This one can be also be refrigerated to make the jelly cold.Its easy for him to hold and has different textures to soothe teething, sore gums.We keep them in the car only for her meltdown moments and they work like a charm every time.A couple months ago, it was a little too heavy and big for her to handle, but now she has no problem at all playing with them, and she's 5 months old now.This is a pretty simple toy but my 5 month old daughter loves it.She was always trying to reach for my phone, and my phone cover is almost the same color as this toy.She likes to chew on the ring, open and close the phone, and press the buttons.I like that the noises are not too loud (aka not too annoying for me).It is one of the few toys she likes enough to roll over for when she was learning.For the price you can't beat it!this toy phone is simple in nature but does the trick.the ring is great as a teething toy and the lights and sounds grab my 7 month old daughters interest.It also keeps her from trying to eat mommies phone.Great toy for the price.Bought this as an afterthought when I was buying toys for my 5 month old because of the reviews.This is his favorite one...figures.I just hand him these & he gets all excited.We attach them to other toys to spice it up sometimes & he's not sick of them yet.Safe to chew on, no paint and BPA Free.like the mother's comment who suggested using them to clip cupboards together, very smart.Havent used them that way yet, but prob will eventually.Very good purchase.Bought these before she was born and she's stil finding ways to use these at 17 months, she likes to use them individually now, to see which smaller toys theyll fit over... which is helping teach her size and comparison.They are our standby toy, they always captivate her.When hung from our activity mat, they were what got her to roll over!You can configure them however you like, and attach them pretty much anywhere.When stepping out of the house, they almost always get tossed in my diaper bag.For the low price tag, cannot be beat.This is the weirdest thing, but for some reason this turned out to be the BEST toy!We flew to Australia and back... and this toy kept him well-entertained.I really didn't need to waste diaper bag space with any other toys for the trip!This was an add on to a baby gift.I use them to attach toys to the carseat, stroller and playgym and my six month old has loved to hold these since about 3 months.And they are so cheap!Cheaper and more links for your money.He got bored of them very quickly... and we never really gave him electronic toys (that would make static toys uninteresting)... his favorite toys werethe infantino butterfly, his baby einstein activity center, etc....Good thing is, they are not a huge investment, so it doesnt hurt to try.Furthermore, I am not confident that this toy meets the standards of safety I would like... My son puts everything into his mouth, so I would like to buy toys made outside of China... looking to  get some Haba toys next.UPDATE: My son is a little older now, and he likes holding these... they are a fine toy.In the end I am glad I purchased... its a small investment and good to have around as a small distraction for him.He loves it when I hang the rings from hisBaby Einstein Around The World Play Gym.They make a great grabbing toy then and he often prefers it to some of the other Baby Einstein toys that come with the gym.I purchased 2 of these and use them for everything.Use them to attach infant toys to stroller bars, baby gyms, infant bar handles, shopping cart covers etc....Best $3 I ever spent!We were going to get her the purple/pink ones but but for some odd reason they were much harder than the blue ones.These are awesome to throw into the diaper bag, or leave in the car seat so they have something to chew on at all time during those tough teething times!!!Luckily, I haven't lost any yet.I like that there are so many links in this set and they are priced well; however, they probably aren't that practical for teaching letters.Seems like a good idea, but in execution, these do not act as links very well, and the varied ways that the letters are depicted is confusing.Also, the narrow areas in some of the links, like K, make other links not hang well.Some of the letters are plainly depicted, like B, D, O, Q, S, but others are outlines, making the representation inconsistent and confusing.i wouldn't use them to teach letters since they're inconsistant, so if that's what you're looking for you're better off with something else.If you are using them to attach toys to your baby's car seat or floor gym they do have openings that make the items easily pulled off.I use them to secure his pacifier to the stroller and toys as well.Water does accumulate in the clear ball when you wash it, so I just wipe it off with a wet wipe now with no problems.This is a little heavy for my preemie baby to hold (now @ 12 lbs) but he loves to kick it when I hang it from his play gym.It holds his attention and he likes to watch it when I shake it for him.He will hold it but drops it easily due to weight.BUT when you go to clean it only use wipes water gets inside and then stays there if you wet it, we keep ours in the car for the babies to play with and it keeps them happy.It is a heavier rattle and takes more motor skills to hang onto it.Especially with the soccer balls being so heavy they can really bang it.Best thing on the market better than those swaddles I never liked them at least I know my son is comfortable has room to move his feet around in.Very cute design, thick & soft knit fabric, smooth zipper action, plenty of room for our little guy to kick.I think this is mainly because the beads were a little too large for him to hold onto with his baby hands until that point.He does enjoy playing with them, though not as much as I had hoped he would.Cute.First - I need to state that I purchased both the Duck set and the Whale set of these towels, and had very different results.The first - the Whale set - has continued to be soft, washed up well, did not stain, and is as adorable as the first time it was used over 7 months ago.On the other hand though, there is the Duck set - it has remained relatively soft, is cute, and does the job.However, after 4-5 months the stitching in the hooded area came apart and unraveled.I have several other towels for my baby, and no others have had such a problem.Perhaps it was just this one, but regardless, it is the reason why I am giving this towel 4 stars instead of 5.These are 100% cotton and very soft and plush.I would not recommend the green one - the frog leaf sticks out of the hood and my son does not like it on his head.Love the yellow hooded towel.These hooded towels are nice and thick and pretty soft.They are better than my other ones which were very thin and smaller.I just use one to wash my newborn daughter's face, hands and neck during the day and hang it to dry until laundry time.They have a really soft side and a slightly rougher side for baths.Very bright and pretty.I needed small washcloths to clean my LO's bottom for cleaning up during diaper changes.I thought the 100% cotton ones couldn't be beat (from the spa silk towel and washcloth set), then I purchased a set of these to try out.The are small and thin enough to get in the nooks and crannies, but absorbent enough to retain enough moisture to be effective.They have a soft side and a "rougher" side.I'll probably eventually start using in the bath, but they are terrific for diaper changes right now.I love these wash clothes.Not only are they super cute but they hold up great.They are not so big that I have to fold them a few times just to use them.I ordered these for my newborn.I love these because they are thin and gets in the nooks and crannies.Not quite as soft as I had hoped or the name imply's (SpaSilk) but it is a good value for the amount of cloths you get.Good for the price.They washed ok.The yellow blanket is a bit plain (the design) but it serves it's purpose.They aren't really big enough to wrap a baby in them but they can cover your baby well when you're holding them.All in all, I would recommend this product.I bought this cover and a Bebe Au Lait one...I think they are made by the same company.I do like that this one has a nice bag for it, though.I think this cover and covers like it are the best I have found for nursing in public.However, other than maybe the first 2 times I used it, I have never been able to arrange it properly so that the "collar" works, so that I can see my baby.I have to have my husband hold it for me so that I can see to get her latched on almost every time.Not sure why I am so mechanically challenged, but it's a problem for me.Another negative to covers like these (for me, at least) is that it kind of screams, "Hey!I'm nursing!", especially because of the bright prints.I also had the problem that I read in another review where my child gets distracted when light shines through the fabric, and she stops nursing every few seconds.I think this is a good idea in theory, but I just can't get it to work for me- I wish I could since I paid so much money for it!I've used this a lot and like feeling fully covered.It is small enough that I just keep it in my purse all the time.I normally buy the Imse Vimse brand diaper liners, but saw that these are a little cheaper, so I thought I would try them out.I thought I would try washing the pee diaper ones like I do with the Imse Vimse ones and see how they hold up.They do well in the wash- other than the fact that they shrink a little bit.Overall, a good product though.They are soft feeling, and I would probably buy them again.First, I bought three different brands of diaper liners, and I see no substantial difference among them.It does not stand up well to washing in my washing machine, but that's probably good if it claims to be flushable.It does stand up to hand-rinsing, so if you want to get extended use out of a wet one, I recommend rinsing it and hanging it up to dry.Here's where it gets a bit graphic, so if you can't handle the poop talk... oh, nevermind.You're reading about diaper products!Clearly you can handle the poop talk!My mom loves these, so I make sure to put one in my daughter's diaper before my mom comes to babysit.Mom claims that it makes things very neat and tidy, and makes it easy to dispose of the poop.In my experience, it is true that the liner makes it easy to lift out a formed poop, but I find it easy enough to get formed poops off my diapers even without a liner.I basically just roll them off into the toilet using the diaper itself (formed poop sticks to itself better than to the diaper).It's not the formed poops I'm worried about: it's the soft or liquid poops.For soft or liquid poops, the liners don't offer much advantage.Sure you can lift SOME of the poop off the diaper, but I generally get messy hands doing so, and a lot of poop is left in the diaper despite the liner.It just oozes around the edges and up the front or up the back beyond the confines of the liner.I end up having to spray or wipe the diaper anyway, and at that point, it doesn't feel as though the liner saved me anything.So there you have it.One brand seems much like the others to me, so you might as well buy the cheaper ones.My mom loves them and swears by them, and anything that keeps her happy about my choice to use cloth diapers is a good thing in my book, so I'll continue to buy them, but when it's just me dealing with the diapers, I don't use the liners at all because I don't think they make a huge difference.These are not flushable!We used these a week and had to call a plummer to snake the main line after a wad of these jammed up in our pipe!This umbrella is super cute.I could not find a useful way to clip it to his stroller.The shade itself is actually quite small and does not provide very much sun coverage.And the clamp did not firmly attach to the bar on my Chico Liteway stroller so the shade would constantly swing out to the side or slide down the bar.After a few attempts to make this umbrella work for us, I just gave up on it and now it is a toy for my son.I really wish I had not spent the money on this product.And it swings at the slightest breeze.I stopped using it because i'm afraid it's going to fall into my daughters face.It hooks onto the stoller just fine, that's not the issue... but once you get it in the right position and tighten it, it stays for a few minutes and then flops.I wanted an umbrella that was cute and functional, but I now I have to look for something strictly functional.My son is currently 4 months old, and he is a frequent eater (breastfeeds every 1-2 hours) who takes very few daytime naps.He also wants to be held constantly and cries if laid down or left alone too long.The Sleepy Wrap is the only way I can get him to nap longer than 30 minutes during the day!He will often sleep for 2-3 hours in the wrap, waking for a snack and then back off to sleep.I'm a full-time student taking classes online, and I can study and surf the internet with baby wrapped against me!It's the only way I can get things done during the day.If you are a fan of Attachment Parenting, this product is perfect.I also use the Wrap when going out and about.I simply put the wrap on at home, then transfer him into the wrap from the car seat and carry him with me in stores, at the mall, etc.A much better alternative than carrying a carseat, lugging along a stroller, or finding a shopping cart to place the carseat into.The Wrap is extremely comfortable when standing or walking, and I have no problems with back or neck pain while carrying my son, who is currently 15 lbs.My son was developing a flat spot on his head, and one of the ways I helped treat this was by keeping him in the Wrap.The website says no repositioning is required, but I find that I do have to reposition my son, from side to side and sometimes further down my chest, in order to feed him.It is not a completely discreet way to feed, so I use my Jelly Bean nursing cover over it.If you have a fussy or needy baby, I highly recommend getting this wrap.Please beware, these are supposed to be non-toxic but they are made in China.When you serve a toddler in an open cup, you leave a lot of room on the top to help them control their spills.If I leave a little extra room on the top for spill control, then I only put like three ounces, which is not enough for my 2 and a half year old.However, I may invest in a small child size pitcher which may help with this problem.Love these things!And, I don't have to worry about them breaking like other glass containers.Kinderville Little Bites Cups are multi-purpose cups - little ones may learn to drink from them, play with, or they may also use them for teething, as my grandson does.The balls from the Haba Wooden Turtles work very well for this activity.As an added bonus for those with teething infants, these cups have a large enough opening so that the child can gnaw on the lip of the cup.Our grandson liked these much better than his teething rings.These cups are useful; the four star rating is because of the squashability and the resulting "mess."I wish they were more stackable.I bought them after realizing the cheap plastic bowls I bought for cereal and baby food may have harmful chemicals in them, found these, and am glad I bought them!They are so much better than plastic because they heat well in the microwave, are easy to clean and don't stain, even with baby food carrots.I plan on purchasing more silicone products in the future in an effort to get away from plastic!My daughter learned how to drink from a "REAL" cup at 5 months.Easy to wash- the only thing that stinks is you can't see through them to see how much liquid your child is getting..Oh well.The Petite Consumer reviews the Little Bites Bowls:Little Bites Bowls by Kinder-ville are stack-able silicone bowls designed for little ones.CoosDishwasher, refrigerator, freezer, and microwave safe (they REALLY are that safe and functional).Testing showed they can go straight from microwave to freezer (Amber loves this for making and cooling instant oatmeal for the kids).Can be washed on lower or top rack of dishwasher (one less thing to remember).Low profile and wide base for no tipping (oh yes, we tested this too...it is true).BpA, Phthalate, and Lead Free.Bacteria resistant and hypoallergenic.No worries about accidentally microwaving these (unlike some plastics and melamine).Non-toxic food grade silicone.Durable (have been washed again and again, kicked, and chewed...don't ask).Hold an ample amount of food (2-3 kid size servings).Virtually indestructible (no worries about dropping it or cracking in extreme conditions).Come in a set of 4 different colors (choices are never a bad thing).BoosDesigns are simple but do not really appeal to younger population (something cute would be nice).Colors are simple.May stain with heavy sauces (like pasta sauces)Some strong odors, like onion and garlic, can permeate silicone (but boiling can help reduce smells).Imported (hey it isn't really that bad).Not easily found in stores (we got ours online).The Petite Consumer Says: We love it because it is a "no brainer."No worries about harmful chemicals, breaking, or it being accidentally microwaved, frozen, or put in the dishwasher.Not to mention that silicone is safe for the munchkins.However, the one major flaw, and it is a MAJOR flaw, is that smells cling to these bowls.Silicone is supposed to help and prevent this, but we can tell you, strong smells you cook with will in fact be absorbed by the material.Once this happens, it is very difficult to get the smell out - particularly onion.Some solutions - don't keep these in the kitchen (perhaps impractical);or, store them in an airtight location/container.This is unfortunate.She is small, so before I discovered this product we had to use a rolled up blanket to support her in the seat.When I started using this, WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MADE!All I have to say is WOW.Not only did it make her more secure in the seat, but it gave her head support, which was important since she would sometimes thrust herself backwards.I am confident when I have to walk away from her for a few minutes, knowing it is fully supporting her.And I can tell she likes when I put her in it, too.I think she likes the snug feeling it gives her.Without this product, she would fall forward in the exersaucer seat.That's no longer an issue.It also lifts her up a bit, so she's able to reach the toys on the saucer.Without it, she wouldn't be able to (she's a short baby).It will extend the life of your baby products so that your baby can start using them earlier.It's worth every penny!Update 7/16/10--The other day I used the HuggaBebe in the baby swing at the park.Yet another great use for it, and without it, my daughter would be too small for the swing.This is such a great invention!Not only is it perfect comfortable snuggly support for baby in the activity center, it works great at the park in those baby bucket swings, and helps baby sit up in those wooden restaurant high chairs.I looked everywhere for some kind of bassinet that inclined slightly to reduce reflux, and after reading the reviews on here we decided to give it a try.The sides are VERY well-vented (similar to the Breathable Bumper), which I believe probably helps to reduce the risk of SIDS, and the padding is quite comfortable.Yes, there is a firm plastic part in the bottom, but babies are supposed to sleep on a firm surface and this never caused our little boy any discomfort.He has never developed a a flat head or torticollis and was able to move his head freely... perhaps a less strong baby would not be able to do so, I don't know, but our baby slept in it the day he came home from the hospital and for 4 months afterward and was fine.He is now seven months and so far has been either early or right on track as far as rolling, sitting, crawling, etc, so although a minority of other reviewers claim this product could somehow stunt growth I certainly haven't seen such a thing in our home!You definitely want to use the buckle once they start moving to prevent slouching and trying to roll, which means no sleep sacks, but if you need to swaddle you can do this with the Miracle Blanket (you can keep the legs free with the Miracle Blanket...I also love that product, but that's for another review).You cannot knock this over unless you INTENTIONALLY grab it by the legs and flip it over.Of course this only works on hardwood floors, not so much on thick carpet.The last thing is that it's washable.The instructions say that only the top padding is machine washable.I was afraid the store wouldn't take it back smelling like that, and my only other option was to wash it.So I took the whole thing apart, washed the metal legs by hand and put both the top padding and the bottom plastic/fabric part on the gentle cycle in my top loader with as much water as possible.Worked like a charm.No more smoke smell, and it didn't hurt the sleeper at all.Took a bit of work putting it back together, but that took no more than ten minutes or so.I only let the bottom part air dry though, didn't want to chance putting it in the dryer.Anyway, I HIGHLY recommend this product!Update: Our second baby, who also hated sleeping flat on his back, did start to develop a slight flat spot in this, but thanks to another Amazon reviewer I quickly managed to nip that in the bud by using the Boppy Noggin Nest slipped underneath the padding (also by giving him more frequent tummy time during the day and encoraging him to turn his head more in both directions).The rocking component is very basic and simple, but once he is asleep, no need for rocking.I like the seat belt feature as it will make this purchase last a little longer than a few months.He likes to sit in it as well as it gives him a better view than flat on his backThe reasons I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are these....1.I find it a little cumbersome to collapse (though maybe should be a pro for safety reasons, but I am thinking of my use)2.She sleeps soundly, and if she wakes up and moves, the sleeper will rock and she'll end up putting herself back to sleep.Her doctor even commented on how great her muscle control is coming.It is well used, and has not suffered at all.I have to say that this is one of the best purchases we made.Enjoy.I wish we had this the day we brought our daughter home from the hospital!She suffered from reflux and would not sleep lying flat on her back (40 min.max at a time).After a few weeks of her sleeping in our arms or swaddled and sleeping in the car seat, we found this cradle.She slept for hours!I can reach over to comfort her or put her pacifier back in her mouth without ever getting out of bed or even having to sit up - great at 2am!At 4 1/2 months, she still sleeps swaddled in this cradle.It folds easily and is light weight.It fits well in the trunk of my car.This sleeper is cute, sturdy (people complaining of that must have put it together wrong), portable.Much more off the ground than a bouncer/swing and it's easy to reach down from my bed and get him for nursing .My preemie baby has frequent bouts of reflux any time she lays flat.She's been sleeping in her bouncer seat, which she was cool with but I didn't like due to the newborn cushion supports on the sides and her tendency to sleep with her face right on them.I've never seen it in stores and I don't know why, because it's absolutely the best thing we've purchased so far.Another huge plus is how high up it sits.Unlike the bouncer which is barely off the floor, the rocker is high enough to be almost level with my bed and she enjoys being up higher.My baby has finally been getting a good night's sleep and I can as well!I would recommend this to anyone with a reflux-prone baby.I love this because just when I fear my baby will spit up during her nap because she ate too much, I put her in this.It allows her to be reclined just a little bit so that I won't worry about her choking on her spit up if she were lying completely flat on her back.When my baby starts to fuss a little bit, it rocks like a rocking chair and baby goes back to sleep.It can be placed in any room so that baby is always with you.At night I put her in her crib.My son has been sleeping in this since he came home from the hospital.I purchased it based on positive reviews and I'm glad I did!At night I put him in the rocker next to my bed and I rock him to sleep.When it's time for a feeding I don't have to get up I can just lift him out and bring him into bed with me to nurse.I would definitely recommend this to others and I will be saving this item myself for use with future children.My son slept in this for the first 10 weeks, including naptime.He did tummy time, floor time, and was held a lot also.He is 6 months old now and has been in a helmet for the past 5 weeks to treat a severe flat spot caused by positioning.I did not know until it was too late that flat spots are not just caused from sleeping on their backs, but the car seat, swing, and this sleeper are far worse than the crib!Being a first time Mom, I had no idea the harm I was causing.I did love the convenience of this--easy to move from room to room, and it folds small so you can take it with you wherever you go.My son still takes naps in it and occasionally sleeps the night in it (he is in a helmet now, so I figure it can't cause any more harm).If I have another child though, this will not be used.My baby will be in a helmet now for at least 6 months to get his head near the normal range.Beware and be careful!The convenience of this is not worth the inconvenience and strain on the baby that it causes.Added to original review 4/25/2011:My son is now a year old and still has a flat spot, even after 8 months of wearing the helmet.He will always have a flat spot, hopefully less noticable as he gets older.The neuro-surgean said that his flat spot was the worst she had ever seen.The improvement from the helmet is there, but since he started so severe, we just can't get it back into the "normal" range for head shape!Imagine causing something to your child that you could have prevented.Don't make the same mistake I did.I paid attention to the other reviews and now use the Boppy Noggin Nest with this to avoid flat head syndrome.This sleeper is great for LO's naps - inclined enough to help colic or gas.This product was very easy to assemble and is light so can transport it from room to room....something I can't do with our swing.I like the fact that this has been approved for sleep, unlike Pack n Plays, swings, and other baby gear we rely on for sleep.So far, LO is ok with sleeping/napping in this product so at this point, I highly recommend this as a good portable option for naps, especially for those who can't get their LO to nap in their crib!This was a lifesaver!I received it at my baby shower and I'm so glad I did!My daughter is an extremely high needs baby and for months she wouldn't sleep if she wasn't on me or my husband.She also had very bad reflux and the doctor recommended we sit her up for at least 30 min after feeds, which is hard to do with late night feeds.Eventually, after about 2 1/2 months, she would sleep in here for naps if swaddled tightly.Eventually she would sleep in here through the night.She is almost 5 months and will still nap in this when we visit family.My mother and mother-in-law both purchased one for their homes so we didn't have to worry about bringing ours since we're there so often.I would HIGHLY recommend this product for any baby!It's convenient, folds pretty flat which was great because I have a very small apartment, and gently rocks itself with baby's movement.My daughter figured out how to push herself up to rock herself back to sleep.I was afraid this would make the transition to the crib harder, but instead, when she was ready for the crib it just happened.And her first night in the crib she slept through the night!And there is an handy pocket on the side for storing baby needs.My daughter would always squirm and wake herself up when placed flat in her crib or bassinet - she wouldn't sleep longer than 30-45 minutes that way much to my dismay.I resorted to having her sleep in her infant swing for a few weeks before discovering this!She would instantly sleep for hours in her RnP Sleeper and I felt it was a safer, more permanent option than her swing.It's at the perfect height for me to reach down and tend to him if he starts fussing a little.When my baby was about 5 months she had a cold so instead of letting her sleep in her car seat at night for the drainage she was able to sleep in this.She is 7 months and still sets in it.I'd not known of this item previously, or I would have purchased it to use from birth.Our baby has had some reflux issues and often couldn't sleep unless he was in his swing (we have the Fisher Price Zen Swing, which we also love).The Zen swing has a weight limit of 25 lbs.He prefers it to napping in his crib and I can get my work done and have him right next to me.We usually keep the sleeper in the family room, which has thick carpeting.Because of this, I am able to easily slide the sleeper around the room - often with baby in it.It is very stable, especially with the weight of the baby.If I take it to another room, I put the baby in his crib temporarily while moving the sleeper as I don't think it was intended for carrying the baby that way.Our baby really likes when I sit in a chair, with him in the sleeper facing me, and I rock the sleeper gently with my foot.He watches me and slowly drifts off to sleep.Another advantage is if I'm watching television, I can face him away so he does not get overstimulated (and I can watch an occasional show or the news).We have not used it for night sleeping since our baby is fairly used to sleeping in his crib now, but for daytime napping this is now my go-to item.In fact, my son is sleeping in it right now as I'm writing this and rocking the sleeper with my foot.Update (March 2010):We just took this with us on a trip and it was great in the hotel room as well.We used this during the day if we were in the room for a bit.We also brought our pack 'n play for him to sleep in at night, but he napped in this.We are so impressed !It was difficult to reach upwards (like the bassinet in the hospital), but easier to lift the baby out of this.Our baby slept in it until week 9 or 10 when he was long enough to push himself into the header with his legs straightened.It folds quickly and compactly.I am a WAHM and I often have to choose between trying to transfer a sleeping baby from my arms to his crib or holding him through a short nap and working with one hand.I keep the napper next to my chair and when he dozes off he lets me slip him into it without waking up.He's also still happy to hang out in it with a handheld toy while I scarf down a meal.He's big enough that I wouldn't leave him unattended in it, but this is the single best piece of baby equipment we've purchased so far.In total, I have 5 places for baby to sleep, not to mention all the gadgets and gizmos.the cheapest by far is the ONLY place my newborn daughter will sleep.Then, I had to help my 3 year old with getting dressed and I just set her in the rocker .when I came back she was ASLEEP!Needless to say, she LOVES it, and mom can finally have her hands free for a while.She has not been able to sleep in it at night yet, but we are working on it.This product is just pure genius, and I am buying one for every baby I know that is on the way!I bought this because my baby won't sleep flat & I wasn't comfortable keeping him in something not meant for sleeping (car seat, bouncy, swing).Also tried a supreme snuggle nest, he didn't like it.This is the only thing he sleeps in.My son wouldn't nap unless he was lying on my chest until I ordered this sleeper.Now he takes long naps during the day.I don't know what it is about the chair, but it is seriously a life saver.I tell all of my friends who are expecting that this one is a MUST HAVE.The negative reviews state that their babies have gotten flat heads as a result of lying in this sleeper.So I put a blanket between the hard surface and the top cover.I've had the sleeper for about a month now and it's great.The cover is removable, easy to clean and soft.After reading so many great reviews this was THE one thing I really wanted off my registry.However, I don't see what everyone is so enthralled about.He ended up sleeping in my arms for the first month because he wouldn't really sleep in it, which I truthfully didn't mind.I wanted him in the same room as us.Then one night he literally was gasping for air the way he was positioned (properly I mind you).That was when I decided to start the crib and he has NO breathing issues.Now I know why the doctors recommend sleeping FLAT on their backs.My baby boy sleeps in here during the day mostly.I saw some reviews that complained about it being hard in the back causing a flat head for their baby.I placed a padded sheet under the covering for extra comfort when my baby was about four weeks.I really like this item and my baby sleeps in it very comfortably, and has no problem sleeping outside of it either.This pillow is cute and soft, but definitely not worth $32!This product is not good for standard to-go coffee cups.I've added a custom picture to illustrate this.The Think King Soft Buggy Cup is taller than a coffee cup and just a little wider, which means that getting the coffee cup in and out requires stopping the stroller and using both hands.I was very sad when I discovered this, since carrying coffee cups is the whole reason I bought the Think King Soft Buggy Cup.Additionally, the packaging actually says to not use the Think King Soft Buggy Cup with hot liquids.This information was nowhere in the Amazon product description, nor on the Think King website.This inexpensive product was the perfect solution.It doesn't stand upright (it flops over) but it still holds a water bottle securely.For the price I think it'd be tough to beat.These hooks do their job.I had them for 3 months or so and they started to slide down.I need to tighten them occasionally.Kinda wish the hooks were swivel type too.I was going through Mommy Hooks like crazy!Living in the city without a car - my stroller IS my shopping cart.I was hooking my reusable grocery bags between my Mommy Hooks - 1 on each side.Every 2 months I was breaking a mommy hook.Then I found these.BTW - your bags don't hang as low as they would on a Mommy Hook so your bags(most) don't hit the wheels.It is so easy to maneuver, even with one hand.The one hand release is so great as well.Its not a reason to not get it though.If you plan on doing walking other than indoors or perfectly paved surfaces, seriously consider better tires.Also, the seat is only made of fabric and never goes fully upright so baby sits slouchy...some of this was improved by cutting a piece of thick cardboard the shape of the seatback and inserting in between the fabric (there is an opening so just slide in like an envelope).Now seatback has a bit more support---although still not fully upright.Lastly, when our child was much lighter, the stroller would tip over with any amount of weight on the handle bar.Now that she's heavier, less of an issue but if bag is hanging off the handles and you remove your child, it always falls over---annoying especially when in public.Overall, this stroller is great but it is best suited for those who will use it only indoors or on very smooth surfaces.When I got the stroller, the seat fabric had a run in it.BJ sent me a brand new one within days.I tried it out several times and was impressed.The City Mini is really ridiculously easy to fold and unfold.To fold, you literally just pull up with one hand.umbrella stroller, I find it easier to get up and down - it's like carrying a heavy shopping bag in one hand.Likewise on public transport, the City Mini is so easy to just fold and get on the bus, subway, whatever.2.Protection from sun, wind, and light rain is great.3.Even going slightly uphill, I can literally push it with one finger.It reclines nearly flat.The one-piece handlebar makes it hard to hang a bag from it; you have to use a bag with really long straps, or buy a separate stroller bag hook.I also find the rubber on the handlebar a little more hot/uncomfortable in the summer than the cool foam handles of my other stroller.And the stroller does not stand when folded, so you have to prop it up against something or just hold onto it.This is the one feature my umbrella stroller has that I really miss.I loved my umbrella stroller (so much, in fact, and for so long, that I almost feel like I'm cheating on it).Very bumpy and shaky even on even pavement.2) Basket is extremely difficult to get to with the metal bars3) Lack of back support is NOT good for baby.You have to buy the PE Board separately for it.(Actually, will be selling ours.Baby not able to sit up straight and 90 degree is problematic.Good support is necessary and so is the ability to view her surroundings!)4) Baby CAN NOT sit up straight in this stroller.There is always going to be some kind of recline5) Harness is NOT a easy to put on.I can tell the manufacturers have really thought thoroughly about this stroller.Everything works well together and there isn't one thing that is not there for a reason.That being said, I will have to gripe about one thing.That is the lack of support for the back.My baby was completely hunched or curled in her seat.It's necessary to add a cardboard backing to the seat or purchase the PE Board.The box says stroller is under 17 pounds, and again, well thought out.If they were to add a board or anything solid to the seat back then it would go over 17 pounds hence not able to be the most desired product with addition to the easy fold technology.I haven't taken it out yet but will do so soon.When we learned that we were having a baby, we did our research and then some.And I am glad we did.This is the ONLY full sized stoller that will fit in out "other" car, a VW New Beattle.And this stroller manuvers like a dream and turns on a dime.We have taken it on airplanes, big and small, and no problem.Our daughter is very comfortable in it, and will nap without a problem.I guess that is their way of keeping the price down, and it is an amazing buy, as I would compare it to some of the $500+ strollers for quality.We live in the city and have to swing around crowds on the sidewalk and get into narrow drugstores etc.I can push with one hand with no problem.The fold is ridiculously easy.Great for getting into cabs or cars while by yourself.The sun visor is great also - it fully covers baby.The only downside is that the basket under the stroller is a little small - but most strollers seem to have this problem, even the $800 Bugaboo!Also there is no cup holder but you can just buy one for like $8 and attach it, no problem.it folds in half, it's super light too!We also purchased the console, the child tray and cooler bag.I think we'll probably purchase the car seat attachment for our next baby too.This time around I was determined to buy one stroller to use for all of our needs.It's the easiest stroller to unfold and fold.You won't be disappointed with this stroller!Literally, you just pull the strap with one hand, it flops closed and you carry it away!Other strollers have sun shades, but this one keeps me worry free and covers my baby even when he's laying down flat.In cold weather, this shade keeps the wind out as well.When it's really cold you can lower it down.There are also many flaps that can be opened to reveal a clear plastic window so you can see the baby when it is upright or lowered.The reinforced back for the 2011 model is much more firm than the previous models.My son is 9 months old and the shoulder straps are on the lowest hook.He will have PLENTY of room to grow into this stroller so for the price, you can't go wrong knowing you won't have to buy another one.There are car seat adapters that you can use for most car seats so when I have my next child I will definitely use this to take the newborn around.Hands down best bang for your buck!This stroller is great-- the biggest items on my list were: *durable *compact enough (can maneuver easily in stores) *lightweight *can turn one-handed.This fits all of them.I have exhasted myself researching strollers, usually you have to choose between comfort and features with weight and portability.Look at other stroller that are cheaper-- you'll find quality complaints (things breaking, heavy).And stroller that aren't nearly as good that are much more expensive.The only major complaint I've seen is that the seatback is too soft, causing the child to slouch.This might not bother you or your kid.But I 'stole' an easy fix from another reviewer: buy a 3-ring binder (the kind with that is cardboard).Cut one portion of the cardboard off the binder and it slides right in behind the seatback (you'll see where you can release the velcro in the back to do this).** update:we have had this stroller for about 14 months now.We got the belly bar for him to pull up and look out.The only problem so far with this stroller is our boy has to pull himself forward to look to the side of the stroller, which annoys him sometimes.We also have found this stroller to be fabulous for taking naps.We just recline it all the way, put down the shade to 'turn out the lights', and rock the stoller a bit and he is off to sleep!Separate plastic covers are annoying-- but with the City Mini canopy the coverage is instant.Only my son's feet stick out some.Perfect for quick runs to the car from the grocery store in the rain-- or we live downtown so it is perfect for rainy 10 minute walks to the store.The harness also makes it- Hard to sit up inThe reason I am taking one star off is that our nineteen month old daughter (who has exemplary posture in the Graco) just can't sit up straight in this.We have taken her on long walks in the Graco and she is fine.On long walks in this she fusses after about a mile and a half.After receiving comments about a stiffening board to go in the back we tracked it down and got one.It is a slight improvement but the seat is still basically a mini hammock and she still (ten months after I wrote my original review) has bad posture in this stroller.I like that it's lighter weight.I like the smaller footprint that it takes up.I don't like that you have to purchase any and all accessories separately, but that also makes this stroller customizable.I do recommend getting the belly bar, if nothing else.This is my go-to stroller, and is in fact my only stroller currently and I just purchased the double version to try out.Would definitely recommend it to any one.We used (or perhaps abused) this stroller 7 days straight, all day, including a trip to Tokyo Disney, and it was just great.We don't use strollers often at home - have a Combi that we mostly used for flights where stroller was not used much at end destination - but wanted something with a better and more comfortable fit for our child who would likely be napping a lot in the stroller, and something that would be a lot easier to manuver in an urban environment and also for Mom who would be traveling home alone and would need to steer stroller one-handed at all times.We got the stroller, the rain cover, and the carry bag, but none of the other accessories.Our take:  This stroller is super easy to manuver and the one-step fold was so convenient when we were nearly constantly going from train to escalator, stairs etc.As one reviewer noted, I love that your child sits recessed so your child is not flush with everyone's shopping bags, cigarettes, etc.I cringed as I watched it tumble out of the luggage funnel onto the bagagge carousel along with everyone else's hard-sided lugagge.Result?(It was in the Baby Jogger bag, which I can also recommend, but that's mainly to avoid dirt and to facilitate carrying - it's definitely a decent bag but certainly *not* intended as protection from international checked-through luggage.I think Dad thought it was a bit extravagant to buy a stroller just for a vacation, but even he was completely sold once we embarked on our trip!I just (on a slow night browsing online) read all the reviews and agree with most of the comments.We chose not to have several strollers to save some money and also to save storage space.I almost purchased the belly bar after reading the reviews, but our daughter loves climbing in and out of the stroller, so the bar would make that impossible.She gets so excited when we take the stroller out from behind the basement door and immediately climbs in when we open it.I also agree that the basket is hard to get to, but we still can jam 2 light jackets and an umbrella from the sides.I also keep one or two reuseable bags down there for impromptu shopping trips.I can definitely open up again sometimes and can be hard to prop up when folded.I love the canopy too, but still think you need the rain cover in colder wet weather to block the wind/rain from your baby's legs.There's so much to say, it's hard to stop!The snack drink accessory is not that great b/c it slouches a bit now, but that's because we hang our diaper bag over the handle.It does make the stroller unstable, but we've gotten the hang of it and usually hang shopping bags from a mommy clip all the time.Our daughter does slouch in it, so we might try the binder cardboard trick.Thanks for the tip!The only other thing is that it does tend to be longer than some more compact strollers.(we don't use the Graco car seat stroller anymore.)This carrier is pricey but it was well worth it.In fact I got the ERGO items cheaper here at Amazon.com than in the local stores.I had another carrier and my neck and shoulders would get sore within 15 minutes.I've been using this ERGO carrier for about a months now.He loves the carrier also...When he is in the carrier, he eventually falls asleep.I haven't used the pouch yet but I figure it would come in handy when we go on trips so I don't have to carry around my purse.I would definitely recommend this productI myself, have TWO other Ergos, the one is black for my toddler daughter and the one is organic brown for my newborn son.I still use both with both kids.Note:  The Organic Ergo Carriers ARE SOFTER than the non-organic (I have one of each kind).I also recommend getting the sucking pads so that you don't have to wash the carrier too often, as my toddler's has faded over many washes (it's a black one).It also gets kind of moldy if your infant sucks on the straps and it doesn't air out properly; another reason to get the sucking pads.I really like my brown organic Ergo Carrier because it has brown sucking pads and they are more "incognito".The Ergo Carriers are fabulous!I'm 5'2" and I'm able to carry by infant without any problems (he's 19 pounds) and my daughter is 32 pounds and my husband can still carry her (she's two years old).Such a versatile product for all ages and stages of early childhood.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product!This worked pretty well for us.The only problem is that the baby and the person carrying her would be covered in sweat pretty quickly.We live in Germany and it was very cold and snowing during Christmas, and we still had to take breaks and let the baby cool off - and usually change her into dry clothes.This insert is definitely needed for newborns, as the regular Ergo (without insert) does not support baby's head adequately if he/she hasn't developed good head control.It's also extremely comfortable for the baby, almost like a little reclining chair with a seat cushion.Snug as a bug.My six-week-old son falls fast asleep in the Ergo and sleeps soundly for hours, and I enjoy the close contact with him.There is the option of putting baby back in the insert by resting the insert on the changing table, but this isn't very sanitary.The same dilemma occurs when trying to feed the baby, as this involves taking baby out and repositioning him.Same problem when baby simply gets fussy and needs to get out of the carrier for a while.In each case, you're stuck holding the insert with one hand or finding some place to put it down.I would prefer it if Ergo would find a way to Velcro the insert into the carrier, once it's properly positioned, so that you could just take out the baby without having to take out the insert and find some place to put it.I read a bunch of reviews on this product and had trouble deciding if it was worth a try since so many people had problems with the infant insert.So here is my two cents.We started using it at about 4 weeks, and she has always been quite content in the ergo carrier with the insert (she is now 3.5 months) and often falls asleep.It helps with head support, and if angled properly, she can lean back and sleep with her head resting back.Sometimes it helps to fold it down to put the thick part lower for support.The main drawback is that it is hot!so for a june baby we have mostly used it indoors (at Costco and people's houses), but this fall it will be great.I also think the little strap that holds it closed could be designed better.You can cinch it up tighter, which was nice when she was littler to keep her head from falling forward (she is a small baby 10.5 lbs at 8 weeks), but it slips right out and becomes loose again the minute the baby moves.And the snap comes undone easily.It would be better if the strap were a length of soft velcro that could attach to the sticky velcro on the insert, and maybe have two straps for better adjustability (in case the manufacturers ever look at these things).All in all, 25$ was worth the extra months of use we got out of the ergo carrier with this.I bought the new infant insert like everyone else on here hoping it would support my baby in the ergobaby.Not to mention it doesn't support his head at all.When he's leaning backwards he looks like he is straining his neck as it doesn't offer much support.I don't know if I'm just doing it wrong but he's looking straight up towards the sky, that can't be comfortable!To be honest my son and I both hate this stupid thing.I wish they would come out with better instructions on how to use it.I might try what others have said they did and just use the cushion, but at 4 weeks I don't think he'll have enough head control for that.Maybe down the line it'll work.I'm excited to use the carrier without the insert.My son is fairly fussy - but if I put him in the infant insert and walk around he stops crying.He often falls asleep in it.I also use it at home during the day so that I have my hands free - since he can't hold up his neck on his own yet.I haven't tried breast feeding with it - so can't comment on that.Great product for anyone that wants their hands free and has a fussy baby who wants to be held all the time.Also, ergobaby has a great website with videos on how to use the insert - this will make sure you position the baby correctly.The Ergo was highly recommended and I bought the original infant insert since it was the only type of infant insert in the store.I already had an Ergo carrier that I bought when my older son was about 4 months old, but I bought the insert to use with my newborn son.Falls asleep instantly.They are trying to make it so you can use your newborn in it.Well, floppy newborns need more support than this.And still, I was afraid of his head flopping around when I did put him in there.Now he is older and doesn't flop, but he doesn't need this.So it was a waste of money for me.I was hesitant to order this on the recommendation of some other reviewers of the insert (see reviews for other patterns).I got the ergo 2 days before the insert and I tried the ergo sans insert with my 12lb 6 week old son.The ergo worked ok, but I didn't know how perfect it would be till I got the insert.So much so that he fell asleep in minutes (without the insert, he fussed a lot because he couldn't quite get comfortable though he did fall asleep eventually).I agree with the other reviewers, it does get a wee bit hot in there.At first I was unsure that I liked this insert.It took a few times to get the hang of it and find the perfect way for my baby to sit in it.After we got the hang of it, it was wonderful.I'm so glad I bought one so I could use my ergo from the start.My baby fit in this until he was about five months old.I have read a lot of reviews saying that this is absolutely necessary for newborns who can't hold their heads up but I disagree.I bought it and found it completely useless.Now, it may be that with a really tiny baby or with a different body type than mine, it could be useful, but I don't think so and I'm only guessing at that because I am trying to imagine why so many people would think this is necessary.My daughter was 7 pounds at birth and I used the insert once before I realized I didn't need it.You just adjust the carrier so that she is held snug against you and she is sitting perfectly comfortable with her head exactly where you put it, with no danger of her falling out or becoming uncomfortable.If, for some reason, the baby's head wouldn't stay where you put it (I didn't have that problem at all) then a receiving blanket could be tucked into the right position to correct the issue (without the potential of blocking an airway of course), but you definitely don't need to spend $25 to fix the problem.You could even stick a receiving blanket under baby's butt to keep her higher up on your chest if you wanted to (it would pretty much do the very same thing this does).. but I never needed to do anything like that.I just put her where I wanted her and adjusted the carrier to hold her there and it felt very secure.I had no worries at all.Again, I don't know if this would be somehow different if she had been under 7 pounds or if I had a different body type.I am kind of average in terms of height and weight.Even if it had been necessary, I probably would have just waited to use the backpack again until it wasn't.I definitely recommend trying to use the backpack without the insert before you spend the $25 and if you need to give your infant extra support, see if you can do it using other means before you decide to buy this product.If all else fails, I would even suggest just waiting until your baby is 7 pounds.If the baby isn't 7 pounds already, it won't take more than a month before he or she reaches that milestone in most cases.. and why spend so much money for so little use.We have a newborn and the Ergo Baby Carrier.It helps to push him up from his bottom to fit correctly in the carrier.When I take him out of the carrier he will stay asleep as I place him in his bassinet.Ergo Baby products are wonderful!!!My little baby will fit so snug in this infant wrap :-).I use this for my 4 mo old son and he loved it!I love my ergo carrier but this is a must if under 6 mo for the head support!It seems to support well my baby.It's really pretty and it's great when baby's older.But for the first 2-1/2 months, I had to put a folded towel beneath the front feet of it to tilt it back.It sat up way too high for a newborn.My one year old is not a fan of these cups-the spout is sort of small and really hard plastic.We had better luck with a rubber spot on his sippies.Maybe these will work better for older kids.These are really cute cups and I like the insulation in them.They stay in better than any others.We used Gerber once but if the cup gets thrown (which ours do) the stoppers come out of the lid and you have a mess on your floor.Then, you are slashing them open with a knife and the point of the "spill free" situation is now moot.I hate buying different kinds of sippies and finding they don't work.In the heat of summer they certainly keep my son's juice or milk cooler a lot longer than the regular sippy cups.I also like Playtex's sippy cups in general because they don't seem to leak as bad as some of the others.I have yet to find any cup that doesn't leak even just a little when it is thrown halfway across the room.Cute designs too.I received this entertainer for my daughter as a gift and at the time I thought it was a bit big and was not sure if at the time I would use it.... little did I know that I would use this as much as I use her carseat or crib!She loves the entertainer even now at 9 months.This unit also raises for height adjustments which makes this a very versatile center.I would recommend this to anyone; best entertainer.My 5 1/2 month old daughter absolutely loves this toy.She is extremely active and this is just about the only thing that keeps her attention for longer than 15 minutes!The moment I put her in it for the first time, she started banging on the piano and singing!She figured it out really fast aswell, she'll play with the 2 toys in front of her for 5 minutes or so, then turn around to something else when she starts to get bored.I'll sit her on my lap with a djembe or darbuka and she'll bang away- and she can keep time!I sit right next to it and interact with her, applauding her music and putting my hand in the puppet and such.If I do go even a few steps away from her, I put pillows all around the base just in case, but I would never leave her unattended in this or any toy.Some babies might not have a problem with this, but she is a big girl and doesn't hold still- she is constantly bouncing and dancing, and she's 28in tall and 18lbs.I am so tired of princess this and that for little girls and I do not buy our daughter any of that stuff but it is so hard finding something cute without all that stuff on it until I found these.I will be purchasing more of these in the near furure.I love Playtex the best out of all the brands of sippy cups because the innner plastic attachment is strong and durable unlike some of the others.A few of her other ones if she shakes the cup the stopper comes out and there goes the drink all over the floor!Ugggggg.But the playtex stoppers have stayed put through use after use.A great product for hte money by far.Although I was hoping for a more gender directed clip- the purple isn't bad for baby boy- there are little fish on it.I tried several other teethers that you freeze or refridgerate and some that were just squishy but my 5 month old hated them all.This is the only teether he will use.He doesnt chew on it for hours but it has definatly been the best so far.Its very durable, the vibrations are very soothing to his poor achy gums, and the handle makes it easy for him to hold.My only complaint is that you have to press down pretty hard to get the vibrations to activate.Before my son got the hang of it I used to have to hold it and press on it myself while he gummed it from the other end.Thank G-d for this vest!Frees up my hands at work so I can get stuff done while pumping.Could not make it through the day without it.Actually wearing it and pumping while I type this review right now :)Pumping isn't the funnest thing to do, but this bra definitely made it a little easier.Minus one star b/c it's not comfortable enough or supportive enough to wear all day (although I'm not really sure you're supposed to do that).I had to pump for the first 7 weeks of my daughters life because she was in the NICU.This product made my multitaking heart smile.A snugger fit it better than a loose one.This bustier has changed my experience with pumping.I have been exclusively pumping for my daughter for 2.5 months now so am using the pump at least six times a day.My hands are totally free so I can read, write, type, etc.In fact, I am pumping as I type this review!I am wearing a 36B or C nursing bra and I bought the bustier in medium and it fits well.With decals all coming on one sheet, it is a little difficult to peel them off and place on the wall while balancing on a ladder.***I think this product should be significantly less expensive, and that they are taking advantage of pregnant women that want to do the best they can for their baby.The product works well enough, that is not where my problems are.It only has 1 speaker.I expected it to have 2, like normal headphones would.Sound quality from that speaker is fine, I just feel like there should be two.The splitter that they included is complete garbage.It warps the sound, causes major distortion, and only puts sound out to one of earpiece on the headphones.It comes with warnings to only use it during the third trimester, and to limit the use to 60 minutes no more than twice or three times a day.This is disappointing because I was hoping to use it on long walks and also starting now, in my second trimester.The velcro that they use is sharp and hard!No matter what I try I can feel it against my skin, and it's quite uncomfortable.Really, they sold me a plushy belt with crappy velcro, a cheap single speaker, and a broken splitter.I'm not very satisfied, though as I said, the sound from that one speaker is fine.I will continue to use the product because there is nothing more affordable that does the same thing.I'm tempted to start making my own, though, and selling them at a reasonable price.They even sent me a new splitter!I guess the broken splitter I got was a fluke, because this new one works wonderfully.- As far as there being only one speaker, they say: "Lullabelly is specifically designed with a single speaker to help protect the baby's delicate ears while still in the womb.The single unit speaker is a safer alternative to headphones, which are made for adult's ears.It is not necessary to use surround sound speakers, as too much sound/stimulation can be harmful to the baby."This makes me wonder about the super expensive music-playing-belly-bands from other companies, like the one that has 4 speakers.I still think 2 speakers would be better than one, but I'm no expert.- I was sad that I could only use it in the third trimester, and I still am.They give a decent reason, though: "Lullabelly is recommended for use starting in the 3rd trimester as this is the time period medical research indicates the baby's inner ears are fully developed and 'active listening' begins.However, they have sound reasoning: "We suggest limiting the use to no more than one hour at a time and limited to two or three times per day - we are firm believers that prenatal music stimulation should be practiced in moderation.The zipper and garment tag should be on the right side when worn.In addition, Lullabelly may also be worn over a t-shirt for additional comfort."To this I can say that the t-shirt may be an option that would work, except it's winter and I'm spending a lot of time bundled in thick hoodies, leggings that come up over my belly, yoga pants that also go over my belly, and sweaters.I have not been wearing it in the wrong direction.They use a very hard velcro that goes all the way to the edges of the belt.If they were looking to improve their product, I would think they could use a thinner piece of the same velcro and totally eliminate that problem.If there was just some fabric buffer on the top and bottom, I wouldn't be able to feel it at all.- Overall, I can say that I am thrilled with Lullabelly as a company.I love that they were concerned enough with my satisfaction that they wrote me a letter to personally address all of my issues.The green color that I got is great, too.Very cute.Thanks, Lullabelly!I'll be recommending your product to everyone I know that is pregnant!We went for this because it saved a lot of width in the car.It's significantly narrower than all the other competing models and we have 2 seats back that adults could sit in.Also, our little guy likes the seat, he will climb in by himself now.That being said, there are a lot of downsides:* It's heavy.Don't believe those pictures with those happy people putting this thing on your back.* The installation instructions are HORRIBLE.I heard some stories about people taking a long time to set it up, and I thought "rubbish!they're incompetent!".To start with, the installation is NOT fool-proof.There are many ways to seemingly hook it up.To add to the misery, the manual also sucks.In words.Very few descriptive pictures.trying to figure it out.* All those extra bolstering cushions.It's not obvious how to "mount" them and the instructions are virtually non-existent, so we ended up just storing them away.Summary?* The installation again.The seat is tough to get straight in some locations.For some unfathomable reason, it is tied to a strap (for storage?)That strap is also a wee bit short, so when I yank the straps tight (as you're supposed to do), it also pulls down one side of the seat!* Shoulder straps.These are finicky.On top of that issue, the straps often don't tighten evenly for some reason.Only if you really need the seat space offered by this narrow chair.That was getting small, and yeah, it looked kind of "cheapy", but the installation was virtually fool proof and everything more or less works easily despite some minor useability gripes.I got this car seat about 2 months ago and have been very happy with it.My 9 month old is very comfortable, and the side pieces support his head when he falls asleep.My 6 year old fits in it too and I might purchase a second one for him as it is significantly smaller than the britax regent that i have for him.(and now that he is reachign 50 pounds, the radian is able to keep him in 5 pt harness using just the latch...unlike the britax) I jsut completed a trip, traveling with this car seat for the first time.It was such a breeze to keep on taking it in and out of cars, the latch is super easy to use compared to other seats I have had.And it folds up too!So my 6 foot husband didnt have a lot of leg room when the seat was behind him.Fact: this car seat is heavy.But that's it's only drawback.And the trade-off is that you get a superior car seat -- one that is durable, safe, and can be used for years.The car seat is narrow, so we can fit it plus two adults in the backseat of a car not too uncomfortably (which was not true of our old car seat).He loves to be in it, whether the car is moving or not, and sometimes even cries when you take him out.When we have it in the house, he likes to sit in it in the living room and just relax.And on a 9-hour international flight, he sat in it almost the entire time and was content and comfortable.these aren't flimsy, or made poorly.another thing i loved was the slim design!they fit SO well in any vehicle.I have since purchased 2 more for our other car.these seats fit great in our Nissan Quest van and they fit great in my Dodge Challenger 2 door.this seat will work from infancy to 5 or 6 yrs old!I've been able to wash the covers once since installing the seats, it takes a bit of work to get the strapes back in place but it's not as bad as others ive had.I started out by buying one to use and see how I liked it.We have two kids and another on the way.I only paid 239!I just sold our Britax Frontier (a pain in the neck to install using a lap belt) and are putting our Britax Boulevard as a spare in another car.I'm so glad we've made the switch from Britax to Sunshine Kids.You definitely will be happy to have these additions in your car...and your kids will be thrilled;)Downside...a little heavy and this doesn't turn into a booster like the Frontier...but really, at 80 pounds harnessed we'll look at our options when they meet that weight limit!My son is 5 months old and we had a chicco infant car seat, but he is just way too heavy for me to carry him in it and since he can sit up and all that good stuff, we thought we would upgrade to a "Big boy" seat.like other reviewers say, it's very heavy!a lot of reviewers say it's very difficult to install, i don't think so!!installed!haha it literally took maybe 2 minutes.hmm what else, it's very tall!but VERY narrow!we have an old toyota camry and my husband is 6'6" and we have no problems with my husband and having his seat back as far as he needs it.i truly would recommend this to anyone!a lot of people say britax, but this is better!we've only had it for about a week, so i'll update in a few months.Baby's due in a couple months, so we haven't had our trial run with the car seat yet, but we've installed it.Seat belt in; click; lock; done, and it's completely stable once properly installed.I do recommend you read your car's owner's manual regarding car seat installation, particularly if you can't get the seat to sit still.I didn't know how to "lock" my seat belt for a car seat until I read it in my car's manual.In theory it's the only seat you should need as it's good from 6 to 65 lbs and installs both rear- and forward-facing.Unfortunately, due to its height, our Mazda Protege doesn't have enough room in the back seat to install it rear-facing unless we move the front passenger seat all the way up into the airbag.So we did have to buy an infant seat for the rear-facing requirement, but look forward to putting the Radian back in as soon as the baby's big enough to face forward.It's a nice, clean looking car seat, not bulky or frilly, and we feel it's more attractive in person than in the picture.The fabric is soft but very sturdy, and the whole thing folds up easily for carrying (to use in another car or airplane).It is quite heavy, though, due to the metal frame.But as I'd rather have metal than plastic, I'll tolerate the weight.We also appreciate the fact that it's not going to be stinking up the car.Initially we looked at this model because we read it contains fewer off-gassing chemicals than other car seats, and it shows.There's no odor coming from it at all.I wanted a car seat for my smaller 2000 Toyota Corolla, especially since I need two convertible car seats (for a 2 year old and a 9 month old).I love the slim design of this seat and that my son can climb into and out of it by himself (a big deal for an independent toddler).My husband was so jealous of this seat that I had to order another one for his car.People with midsize cars say that they can fit three side by side (even though I don't think I could quite pull that off in my smaller Subaru Impreza)2) Collapsible for travel - they fold flat and makes it easier for pushing them around, say in an airport3) Easy to keep clean - the mesh is fast drying and does not hold stains-'s1)  Have to go behind the seat to get the straps tight enough (think that has been fixed in teh newer one)2) Bigger and taller - It is designed to hold a larger kid, so it is a bigger seat, fundamentally...  still for a3)  no cupholders :)4)  height adjustment requires rethreading the straps!!!Yuck.Our Britax Frontier 85 and Graco Nautilus do not require this.All in all, probably stil the best seat on the market for a smaller car, but behind the latest Graco Nautilus and Britax Frontier 85 in terms of full features.Well built, and very heavy car seat.When my son and I travel, we use the car seat on the airplane for landing and take off.However it he wants to walk around, this folds down far enough that we can stick it in the overhead compartment.A regular car seat cannot be stowed so easily.We had looked at every car seat and were debating between the Britax, Sunshine Kids and Saftey First.We went to a baby store that had a car bench and all of the seats so we could strap them in and check them out.The Sunshine Kids seat is remarkably thinner than all other car seats, in fact now that we have it in our car passengers in the back seat have much more room than they did with the Graco infant car seat.It has a sleek look, very comfy cushion for the baby and was easy to install.I can wait until the baby can sit forward facing.By the time you get the wipe out and wipe your baby's bottom, it's really no warmer than taking it out of a normal wipes case.I thought about cloth diapers FOREVER before jumping in and trying them.With my first child, I was a disaster.I didn't change him often enough, and it seemed like he was always wet.And none of his pants fit well because his butt was huge in the diaper.So second child I decided to skip it.With my 3rd, my older 2 were asking questions about recycling and landfill, so I felt ridiculous contributing to the 100 years it takes for a disposable to decompose in the landfill.So I gave it another try.I washed them using their instructions and suggestions on soap, and you would just not believe how awesome they are.No rashes, not as bulky as the other brand, they have absolutely no smell, are incredibly soft, and are super easy to take care of.Now I am a SAHM so it is probably easier for me, but if you are looking for an alternative to disposable, consider FBs.They are the trimmest on the market, and really look cute on.She always gets compliments on them (they still show a bit out of the top of her stretch pants).I love these diapers!UPDATE: I am still using these 6 months later, and my only recommendation is to make sure you are using the 4-ply inserts.If you buy from an alternate vendor and you get the 3 ply (made in China and IMHO not absorbant at all) just email FB and they will send you 4 ply liners by Fed Ex, no charge.Their customer service is top on my list.Zero rashes, no blowouts, easy to care for, better for the environment.I went with sized fuzzi bunz because I like the trim fit better than the one size and I had heard bad things about bum genius velcro wearing out.Not me-- I want one thing that works and this is it.I use one disposable at night because I don't want to bother coming up with a perfect night time solution and I'll use 7th gen when we travel too.When the baby grows out of these I'll resell them for half price.Almost free diapers!They really retain their value.We live in an apartment building and don't have access to fancy rinse cycles so I wash once with a bit of Charlie's Soap (hot) and then wash once with some white vinegar (hot) to make sure the soap rinses out.The vinegar helps any odors go away which can be a problem with synthetic diapers (but not mine).I had agonized over what kind of diaper to use and eventually chose these.I was skeptical.I don't consider it a burden.It's not gross yet, either, as I am still exclusively nursing.Here's my breakdown of the fuzzi bunz perfect fit for the first 4 months of diapering:Pros:Convenience -- I never run out of diapers.I find laundry much easier than buying disposables all the time.I'm saving about $1000 using fuzzi bunz instead of disposables on this baby (including all laundering cost).Just wait until I reuse them for a second baby!Traditional prefolds would be cheaper yet, but I think this is pretty good for a product that feels expensive up front.Design -- Snaps are awesome.I find these to be quite dummy-proof.Blowouts -- I've only had two major blowouts the entire four months I've been using these diapers.With disposables, I'd had many more, and I only used them for a couple of weeks!Style -- The colors are so cute.They look like those little diaper covers that come with baby dressesHealth -- My baby rarely gets diaper rash in these.Our trash exploded from 1 bag a week to 3.We're back down to one bag a week with cloth.I have 18 diapers which gives me about 48 hours.That's not bad, but you can't just ignore it!Bulk -- I don't find it difficult to use cloth diapers when out and about, but I do find them bulky.My diaper bag is huge if I go out for the day.Also, baby clothes always stop fitting in the butt/crotch first because they're not build for such big diapers.Leaking -- These don't leak much, but they do leak sometimes.I haven't fixed it yet because my sewing machine is down, but I will someday.Drying -- The microfiber inserts soak up a ton of liquid, which is GREAT, but they also take forever to dry and stick to anything cotton like glue with crazy static cling!If you're doing diapers-only in the drier, then it doesn't matter, but I wash my flannel wipes with my diapers.Tips and tricks:I wash withCharlie's Soap Powder - 2.64 lb Bag (80 Loads).I run a cold rinse without anything, then a hot wash with high agitation and a heaping scoop of Charlie's, then a cold rinse.I tumble dry on low heat, or dry in the sun.It has to be a VERY hot and sunny day to dry the microterry inserts in any timely fashion, so plan accordingly.You're not supposed to use any ointments or salves on the baby's bottom with cloth diapers lest you clog up or coat the diaper with water repellent, oily buildup.Most of the time this is not an issue as your baby isn't as likely to get rash in cloth, but every once in a while it's bound to happen.When my daughter did get a bad diaper rash (after I ate something that didn't agree with her), I cleaned her and slathered her bum withAquaphor Baby Healing Ointment, 14 Ounces (396 g) (Pack of 2), and I used a flannel wipe (you could also use a rag of any sort) to keep the ointment off the diaper.It seems to have worked well both for her bum and for the diaper.When these diapers leak, they do it in one of two ways which allows you to troubleshoot a bit.Every time I put the diaper on, I'd slide a finger along the thigh and make sure the elastic was snug, no gaps.This helped a lot.Other times, the microfiber insert slips up the back and seeps urine onto her clothes.This will help you avoid leaks.That's it!Sorry this is so long, but I hope it helps some of you other parents decide what type of diaper to buy and how to best manage it if you choose this kind!*UPDATE*  I'm still using fuzzy buns on my 1-year-old, and I'm still happy with my choice, however I have changed my washing routine.The Charlie's Soap eventually built up in my diapers, and they started to smell very strongly of urine, even after washing.Rather than adjust my local water chemistry with an inline softener or borax in every load, I switched to Country Save (a similar washing powder), and I also use an oxyclean soak once a week before washing as a preventative measure.We wash it out in the morning and hang to air dry.Snaps stay fastened.Only minor leaking once or twice after heavy wetting in 6 weeks of use.We use regular birdseye prefolds with hemp or Zorb  inserts.I have heard some negative or neutral reviews of this diaper, but so far it's worked well for me and my 7 week old son.Great bag.I use it for dirty fuzzy buns when I go out and my daughter needs to be change.Keeps the dirty diaper smell in and looks great.made well.I absolutely never thought it could happen - a cloth diaper bag that is not only waterproof, but "smell-proof" too!I store about 13 Fuzzi Bunz in there at a time, even poopy ones, and there is absolutely no smell in my kitchen where I store the diapers on a doorknob.On wash day, I take them downstairs, unzip the bottom, and put the bag unzipped in the cold water with the diapers to soak.It is dry within a few hours and I am good to go.Update 3/3/11A while back we figured out a good way to keep it from smelling.This prevents odors from escaping.Also, the bag is no longer very waterproof, but if you're careful to drain the diapers well after rinsing, it doesn't pose too much of a problem.Overall, I'd buy this product again, but I wish it were higher quality.Still, it's probably the best environmentally-friendly option out there, at least that I've seen, and it sure beats using a diaper pail w/plastic bag!Past review from 8/20/10:Not sure how exactly this bag wasn't smelling for the other reviewer.Designing a wet bag without a drawstring was not the best idea.For now I'm going to try closing it with a ponytail holder or rubber band, but I'd advise other customers to wait and see if they give it a drawstring closure in the near future.This bag is a lifesaver.We have it hanging on the side of our changing table where it is easy to place the dirty diapers.The zipper on the bottom makes laundry time easy.This bag isn't sealed, but for some reason it is WAY less stinky than the bag we were previously using.A full load of dirty cloth diapers can get heavy, but this bag is well constructed and is perfect for the job.I like the size, shape, and material of this bag.My only compliant is that by laundry day the odor of the diapers is not contained by this bag.I thought this had a draw string closure, but it's always open at the top.It's nice to be able to hang this and save some floor space, but even putting essential oil on the fabric tab (which is located at the very bottom on the bag, so once a few diapers are in there I don't want to dig for the tab to reapply oil!)didn't really change the odor.I wonder if other moms are desensitized to dirty diaper smells after doing cloth for so long?I may just use this to line a pail with a lid instead.This would make a nice large size wet bag for a whole family's bathing suits in the summer time.I am so glad I ordered this item, even though it is pink and my son's room is all done up in green.It's great!The big selling point of this bag is that it makes it easy to load the washer.I like that because I can hang it on the dresser drawer knob and it doesn't drag on the floor.However, some people might want a larger-sized bag.I like that it has a scrunchy knob hook, rather than hooking with a drawstring.I have another bag that hooks onto the door with a drawstring.As a result, the heavier it gets, the more the bag closes, the more you have to work to get the diapers in.This one stays open (or closed, if you put the other loop onto the knob).it is same material used on their diapers.the concept is awesome, but the problem lays in when u change them out in the mall or at someones house and baby pees or poos by accident on the fleece side,and you cant wash it...and then it cant be reused later.i keep these at home, one downstairs and one upstairs.I use them with my other FB diapers.And it really does hold up as far as function goes too.I only need to put it on a drying rack outside for a couple of hours, which saves a lot on electricity.And stains disappear with just a few hours in the sun.I like the sturdiness of the snaps and the stretchy waterproof cover, which contains messes well.The diaper feels soft on the outside and inside.The material is also very durable (no fuzzy pills) and looks nice wash after wash.  And the diaper also washes really easily - just toss the whole thing in the wash - one rinse cycle on cold, a hot wash cycle, and then a cold rinse.Note that that the diaper is meant for "10-45 pounds" and will be huge on most newborns as well as bad for the healing of the umbilical cord (since the diaper covers it and could keep it from drying out).On the smaller settings (for babies less than 18 lb), it is a little more difficult to get the insert into the cover.Also the fleece makes it hard to tell if the diaper is wet unless you stick your finger in the diaper or smell it.On the other hand, the fleece does help keep the baby's skin dry, preventing diaper rash.Fuzzibunz says the warranty is void if you use diaper rash cream, but if you need it, California Baby diaper rash cream is the best (and smells wonderful).One other thing I wanted to mention is that this diaper is VERY sensitive to the amount of detergent, and mine started stinking and leaked badly when I used too much detergent.I had to rinse them like crazy until all the suds disappeared.Now I make sure I only use 1/4 of the detergent and not 1/2 like the instructions say (I have a small washer-dryer unit which has the dryer stacked on top).Yes, it is very counter-intuitive to use less soap when it is more stinky, but the soap gunks up the fabric.So if you get any leaks, the first thing to try is (after you've washed them clean) to do an extra cycle on hot and look for bubbles, which indicate you have too much soap.You'll need to keep rinsing them until the bubbles are gone.The fuzzibunz website has a number to call if you have problems, and there is a warranty on the diapers (so keep your receipts).A final suggestion for new cloth diapering parents - when we first came home from the hospital after using disposables, the thought of using cloth was daunting.I suggest having some disposables to use for the first few weeks while the umbilical cord dries out.The adjustment to caring for a newborn and the exhaustion can be overwhelming, so be flexible and make it easier on yourself during this initial adjustment period.When you are ready, take some time to figure out what size to adjust the elastics to (the sizing chart was very helpful).What I did was adjust a few diapers to different sizes and try them on to find the best fit (as it turned out, the sizing suggestion on the package was right on for me).Line them up or stack them in a drawer so that they are ready to go.That way, you are not overwhelmed while the baby is crying and needs changing.UPDATE - There have been many instances of leaking.A couple of times, I had to resort to "stripping" them by scrubbing the inserts with a toothbrush and Dawn dishsoap (and wasting a lot of water/energy/time getting the soap out).I would also suggest that you "strip" your washer of buildup, avoid using fabric softener, and start using less soap for your other clothes.I usually avoid washing diapers with my other laundry.I also started using water softener every few washes and whenever I have repelling issues.After 9 months, I had to start using doublers at night.After 12 months, even the two fuzzibunz inserts together didn't give my baby enough absorbancy, and I started using Seventh Generation disposable diapers at night.Then I found out that babies can be potty trained (EC - elimination communication) and stopped putting diapers on her during the day.This was an obvious choice when transitioning to cloth diapers.I bought one to try and subsequently ordered more.I like that I can make it looser around my little one's thighs (he is rather chunky) and a bit tighter around his waist.Velcro does not have this benefit.I have washed them every day and line dried with no visible wear.I have had a couple of issues with leaking since the outer material is not water resistant, but if you change them often or add inserts, it should not be a problem.If you are looking for something with better leak protection, either add a cover (although this could make it a bit too bulky) or check outThirsties Pocket All-in-One Cloth Diaper - Raspberry, X-Small 6-12 lbs.They're a little tedious to adjust in the legs and waist, but once you have the elastics set, then they fit great.However we've found, especially when he was smaller, that his onesies get soaking wet around the leg-holes, if we do not tuck the "wings" on the front of these diapers inside.A little hard to explain, and according to the owner of my nearby natural parenting store, no other customers had this complaint, but we have found that above the leg elastic and below the snaps, there's a little piece of fleece-lined fabric that looks like a little wing.The fleece is great at soaking up and wicking away urine... but this wing is a design flaw, in that it wicks the pee right out and onto the leg of the child's clothes.So, a long time ago we started tucking that little wing inside the nappy when we put a fresh one on him, and that has done wonders to decrease the wet clothing.Also, we do not use the cloth at night, because he gets really red if his skin stays damp and we feel disposables do a better job of keeping him feeling dry for those 12-hr stretches.During the days, though, the FuzziBunz are great.About 3 months ago, we discovered the Kushies flushable biodegradable diaper liners, and we now use those with the FuzziBunz.We're not to 12 months yet with the snaps, but so far so good, and we haven't heard any other moms say the snaps quit working as well with time, so we're optimistic.These are an investment, but even with our sometimes using disposables and always using liners, we've already saved money going with the FuzziBunz over exclusively using disposables.We think they are worth it, though really would like to see the company modify their design to eliminate that problem with the wings.My husband's reservations about cloth diapering was that the hook n eye tapes were large, stiff and "could cause scratching" (we've never had that issue so I don't know where that came from) He got this diaper and fell in love with the snaps, I see us getting several more of these in the future!Planning to go primarily OS pockets with baby #4 due in the spring (along with the old stand-by prefolds, because you just can't get away from prefolds!However I find the Fuzzibuns JUST fits my 29 pound girl, and are tight to the point of mean on my 35 pound girl.I have not had any leaks that couldn't be blamed on the insert being full.I have had blow-outs, but I suspect that is due to how snug these are.I suspect if you compare these to the BGs, FB will have the edge earlier on, and BG will have the edge later.Granted, I mainly do prefolds and these are the only pockets I own so I can't really compare these to other brands out there.I found that these leak periodically and I haven't used anything on them that would cause repelling.I don't have this problem when I do prefolds.It is annoying that after every wash, the elastics that adjust the size for the thighs come out of their slots and have to be put back in.They hang out in four places and when you want to just put them away, it's a little time consuming.Update after 9 months of use:Maybe it's just me, but I'm not impressed.And at this point, I consider myself seasoned in cloth diapering because I have them all.Every kind and every brand.The only good thing about this diaper is that it is the least bulky.But the inserts aren't as absorbent as I thought they were.Now that my daughter is older and she is peeing a lot more, it is necessary to use a doubler to prevent leaks.A couple months ago I noticed I was having leaks ALL THE TIME.Very frustrating when you're out and about and see a big wet spot in your stroller seat.I realized it was because the PUL in some of my Fuzzibunz were delaminating.The lamination was literally ripped apart.I rigidly follow the instructions for care and maintenance with all my diapers, never drying the covers because of the heat wearing out the PUL.Now the fact that I was having a problem with this makes me question how long these diapers could really last if these were used on a regular basis.When I addressed this with Fuzzibunz, they were quick to send me replacements at the cost of paying for shipping to send the damaged diapers back to them.When I received my replacements I immediately noticed a difference in the quality between the ones I had purchased and the ones I received.It seemed like a much cheaper counterpart to the ones they sell in retail.This is frustrating when you intentionally pick out different colors to meet the preferences of the gender.You have to be very careful not to use any cremes or lotions, including diaper creams, that will build up in these kind of diapers and cause repelling.Overall, I won't be buying Fuzzibunz ever again.I bought a lot of our FB used and they had inserts of questionable origin.I doubt they were original FB and if they are, they've gotton much better.I decided to upgrade all of my inserts with the four ply (not three ply, which they also sell) inserts.What a great idea!When I finish with the diapers I'll sell them again and even with replacing the inserts, practically make money on diaper use!I read the great reviews on this product and having a bigger baby decided to give it a try.It is made very well and my daughter took right to it!When I received it I thought it might be hard to assemble.You will need a Phillips screw driver, they include six screws inside.It was easy to assemble, still healing from a c section, there was not much bending involved.My daughter does not like being strapped down in her swing but for some reason she does not mind being strapped in this rocker.I will add some padding, a snuggle head support.Other than that this is another Fischer Price product my daughter loves and I see us getting a lot of use out of it.Very happy!Update March 23, 2012: My daughter now uses this as a toddler chair to watch TV.She is now 17 months.I really am getting my money worth's out of this chair.I purchased this rocker for my 7 month old baby.Previously, my baby would recline in a bouncer, which he loved.He would bounce like crazy but now he has gotten a little big for the bouncer so I thought he would enjoy the rocker but the rocker barely rocks at all and the rocking motion is jerky because of the built in stops on the bottom of the rocker.We use it only as a chair not a rocker.I wouldn't buy this again.When my daughter was first born, we purchased the fisher price bouncer chair, had I known this was available, I would of just saved money and buy this one from the very beginning.This chair is great, it has three different settings.It's very portable, you can easily move it from one room to another.My daughter loves this chair.If you're a first time parent, save yourself money, skip on the bouncer chair and buy this.This is a great product!My daughter's been using this rocker for almost two months now (she turned 4 months this week) and she just loves it!It's the perfect place to put her while I'm cooking dinner because it keeps her close, but not too close, and entertained (i.e., she can see me easily from the side of the kitchen when she needs a mommy fix, but has plenty to do on her own when she doesn't).She has fun rocking herself when she kicks her legs and loves to pull (and taste) the hanging toys, which I've added to and swap out regularly.One important thing though, this fisher price rocker - the PORTABLE model - is fantastic ... it's very sturdy, low to the ground, reclines into a fully horizontal position (for those few occasions my little angel has fallen asleep in it) and has built-in stops that prevent it from rocking too far, and I also like the fact that its toy arm swings away (critical for those times that my baby gets a bit overstimulated but I need a few more minutes to finish whatever I'm doing in the kitchen before I pick her up) ... but I would NEVER buy the standard fisher price rocker because it has a significant tipping problem.The only thing I wish it would do is play music.My son's other infant seat from fisher price vibrated and played music, this one just vibrates which I find kind of boring especially if it's meant for newborns/infants as well.When we first brought our new baby home, I used it for her to sleep in right next to the bed, because I wasn't comfortable putting her across the room, yet.I feel like it was a great investment because it is going to be useful for so long - from the very moment I brought her home until she is ready to sit up and rock herself.I love that the toy bar is not only removable but also turns out of the way when you want to pick the baby up without removing it and without bumping her head.I also like the fact that it folds up, can be propped against the wall, and is light weight to carry.I plan to take it to my mom's house for baby to sleep in when I need her to babysit.Very very good buy for the baby rockerMy daughter is 5 weeks old, and we are so disappointed by this swing.When we were looking for baby gear, we thought this was great - options for swinging, sturdy, plug-in, and looked fun.It was brand new on the market, unrated, but we went for it.The swing speed is so slow, even on the fastest setting, that it irritates our baby unless she is asleep.She is less that 8 lbs at 5 weeks, so I am sure it must be slower with a heavier baby.2.Swing vs. Glide: This seemed like a great advantage over other swings.However, she only likes one way (as I think most babies would) so once you know what they like, all the options are useless.4.The mobile should at least move out of the way to put the baby in and out.I like that it plugs in, since we go through enough batteries on other baby devices.I would not buy this swing again unless it had a better swing speed.Update:  We stuck with this sucker until my daughter neared the weight limit of 20 pounds at a year old.we hardly used it near the end, but for a while we had it worked out pretty well.We still wouldn't buy it again, and made sure to warn our new-parent friends.I read the negative reviews on several websites, but thought my experience would be different.I purchased this swing because at the time it was less expensive than other models for sale.Plus, we only wanted a swing that could be plugged in, which it does.Note: we only used the cradle swing feature.Pros:  Attactive.Appreciate foot controls when holding a sleeping baby.Cons:  After using this swing for 10 weeks it no longer swings properly.We turn it on high and it barely moves.Last night it stopped working completely and woke my very fussy, teething baby.The music turns off after about 20 minutes, which wakes the baby.I would not recommend this swing for anybody.We are returning it and found a Fisher Price Little Lamb swing for $122 plus free shipping.If you purchase this swing, please save your box, instructions, etc.This is my 5th swing, and we have been using it for 1 month.I have 2 kids, both of which used (and one is still using) a swing to sleep in for the first 6-7 months of life.The swing is the only place either of them will sleep; our crib for the little one is currently being used as a storage hamper.That means my swing is turned on for naps 3-4 times a day for 1-3 hours at a time, and then on all night for 10 hours - you get the idea.Then we had a Papasan cradle swing, which we also loved.When the Papasan died my husband went out and got this swing as the replacement.Now, my opinion:Pros:- Looks nice - clean and modern design- Music/nature sounds are good and sounds very real - not tinny or electronic- Big flat base less likely to trip over in our tiny living room- No more batteries!We were blowing through 4 D batteries every 4 days!Cons:- Barely swings in comparison to the other Fisher Price cradle swings- Seat is more narrow than the Papasan - my baby is small and she's tight in there!- Glide is too jerky and therefore useless- The big base makes it harder to travel with - even the non-travel cradle swings we had before could be easily packed into the car for a weekend awayI would go with a different Fisher Price cradle swing over this one in a heartbeat.It's not terrible, but it's not great either.If you want a swing that actually swings well and is pretty reliable ven with moving it around and heavy use, try a different one.I've used this swing for my daughter since she was about a month old.It worked great for us in the beginning, sometimes it was the only thing that would put her to sleep if she had gas.However, I don't see how this is supposed to work for a bigger baby- my daughter is now 6 months and about 18lbs, and it barely moves even with fresh batteries on the highest setting.It also creaks, and the seat pad dips so low she almost touches the ground.Also she is getting close to being able to sit on her own, and when she pulls her head & shoulders up, it comes to a complete stop.I would still recommend this swing as it doesn't cost nearly as much as a full-sized one, just don't expect it to be useful all the way up to the maximum weight limit.When my daughter was smaller, it was a lifesaver.It fits easily in the trunk of the car, so if friends invited us over for dinner, I could sit her in this next to the table and actually be able to have a hands-free meal.One more review for the five start list!I have been putting my little boy in this since he was able to hold up his head properly (yes, a couple weeks below the recommended age) and we put a phone book under his feet.He would spend long enough in it to let me do the dishes!Now, it is summer and I use it outside while I hang up laundry.There is a down side, but I give it 5 stars because I would definitely but it again or recommend it to a friend.The songs are not the best, though I have heard worse.When I do get tired of the noise I am glad there are two sets of songs/sound effects and switch.Additionally it is awkward to move- impossible single handed- so I have to leave my little guy in the house for a moment while I take it outside.I don't think there is anyway to fix that, so I deal with it.I fought with my husband over buying this jumper instead of the ten dollar cheap ones that hang off of the door frame.We both agree that this was definetly worth the money!all my daughter has to do is see her beloved jumper and she gets wicked excited!!it even comes with a little teether!i would buy again in a heart beat.He especially loves the mirror and chew rings around it.After about two weeks of use, he finally got the hang of it and now he enjoys it so much!My only critique would be for Fisher-Price to make the hanging turtle and parrot lower or maybe hang them from elastic bands.My son is still too short to reach them and sometimes gets frustrated trying to reach them.Other than that, two thumbs up!She will happily jump and play for a while!The worksmanship is nice, and there are a lot of different things to do, so she doesn't get bored.My one criticism is that it takes up a lot of floorspace.I guess it says a lot about the product that we like it enough to keep it around anyway!I was very impressed with how safe this product is...made very well and with thoughtful care for baby safety.I trust the Fisher Price name too.The entire product is easy to wipe down with disinfecting cloths...no nooks and crannies for dirt or germs to hide.The design of the frame keeps the jumperoo on the floor even when baby jumps very high.I would highly recommend this product to anyone, especially those who have space for only a few baby items.With this jumperoo, there are spring latches you push in to take the frame apart, then you can lie flat for storage...perhaps under the crib.I haven't had a need to put it away yet, and neither will you as your baby will use it every day.pros: lightweight, easy to move, baby likes it, lets me work out for 30 minutes.cons: it could have more toys for the price, the swivel seat doesn't swivel easy enough for my baby to do it on her own.She can stay in her Exersaucer longer than the jumperoo.There is also more to do on the exersaucer than on the jumperoo.I love it and she is crazy about it.Best buy EVER!My 5 month old does not have chunky baby legs and the leg holes for this product pinch her little legs.She HATES being in it and I plan on returning it.She loves to jump and I keep buying the inexpensive solutions.I am breaking down and buying a full jumperoo because these space saving products just don't cut it.It doesn't bounce easily and because it pinches her she didn't really have an interest in the toys and other features of the product.Upon receiving this, I followed the assembly directions explicitly and made sure everything was in place correctly before placing my baby in it for the first time.Sure enough, the stand was clicked into the base as it should be, but it wasn't as secure a fit as I feel it should be.The stand should be secured to the base with something more substantial, like screws, but it's a "click in-click out" type of assembly.I suppose that is to make it easier to disassemble, but it's more important to me that the bouncer be safe than convenient.I am returning this to Amazon.Very cute and great for limited storage space.Baby LOVES to roll the eyes and chew on the purple toy, but the baby chick is useless and the ladybug is difficult to move for a little one.Also disappointed that the overhead bar toys are too far away for a small baby to touch or chew on and aren't removable.We also had to buy rubber mats to build up the base so the baby's feet could touch.The green ring is as hard as a rock and doesn't make a sound.Fisher Price made another one where all rings make a noise and are soft.They are green, orange, and zebra striped.Buy that one.When he was 3-4 months he played w/the polka dot ring the most basically eating it.He plays with the green ring that rattles a lot now at 10 months.The purple one just squeaks but only by the fish and I have to squeeze it for him.When Gavin tries to put the rings over the giraffe head, it inevitably tips over.At first, I had to hold the giraffe in place so he could play with it.Anyway, I took a screwdriver to the base, removed it and filled it with beans to give it a little more heft.So far Gavin hasn't bashed himself senseless with it and the giraffe stands up better now, so I guess it worked :)I love this toy, and although I love the ones I had when I was a baby, this one is just as cute and very durable.I kind of wish that I would have gotten one with more music/sounds, but aside from that, I really like it.I didn't think I'd be able to use it for at least a few weeks, but she has been perfectly fine in it from the beginning and really likes to look at the butterfly and flowers -- its one of the first things that really grabbed her attention.The one thing that I really dislike about the bouncer is the little tune that plays when you pull on the butterfly.It is really tinny and annoying but it does distract the baby occasionally.At first, I just used the bouncer to put the baby down in an upright position when tired of carrying him around and when he needed to burp.Instead he loves to wiggle and throw his legs up and down.When tired of bouncing, he just sits and grabs the toys, when pulling the frog it plays some music.!, he sits independently otherwise and it has not been a problem, in this bouncer he just leans back and lets the fun begin.UPDATE: there's an added surprising interest for the baby -- the button to turn on vibration.My son had been staring at it for the longest time until I put him to sit in front of the bouncer.So now he sits in front of the bouncer and giggles while the bouncer vibrates!Go figure what babies enjoy!You or baby will have to add the energy to make it bounce.What's a bit odd is the distance between the toys and the chair - it's just too far for a baby to reach unless they can lean forward and sit up.But if a baby can lean forward and sit up, they're no longer supposed to use the bouncer!So our daughter has reached wistfully for the frog for months now; at almost 4 months old she's close to succeeding, but she's also doing stomach crunches in her chair, so it won't be long before we have to retire this product for something else.All in all, it's kept her secure and occupied and that's all we could ask for.The chair is overall a good product, but when I've received it the chair was a little bit dirty and have scratches on the back of the chair, also the fixation to hold the baby were not easy to assemble, I had to unsew the strap and resew it...This is a good highchair.I like how I can attach it to our dining room chairs or set it on the floor.The only bad thing I would have to say about this product other than high pricing is it could use a little more padding!For that reason my daughter doesn't like to sit in it for too long.This high chair is great!The tray can be removed and is dishwasher safe and the cover is washable too.I would highly recommend this product.I've been using it for about three months (baby is now 8 months).The print is very nice.When I had it in a reclining position it didn't quite fit in my chair.When my baby was smaller there was a lot of slack left on the straps which was always in the way and he was always chewing on them.It's a bit hard to get him in and out of them.I often have difficulty sliding the tray in.I do wish it had a bit more cushiony padding.The tray sits nice and close to her body, so the mess is mostly contained to the tray.I love that you can raise and lower the seat so she is at the same height as the rest of the family.She LOVES the seat, she lounges in it like the Queen of Sheba.I also like the fact that it will easily convert to a booster seat so I won't have to buy another seat.Update: Still like the chair, but the tray is so large that it barely fits in the dishwasher, and our dishwasher is fairly large and adjustable.The scatterbug color is not too bright and not too dull, just fine, and it is unisex.My baby likes sitting in it and even fell asleep in it once, which is very unusual for our baby.You can remove the tray with one hand but the tray doesn't come very close to the baby, especially if your baby is not too big (mine is 14.5 pounds).This product is great.We ordered 2 of these covers for our standard size diaper pad and love them.They are very soft and machine washable.I would highly recommend these covers.Our newborn liked these Mam pacifiers over all other types, probably because of the shape of these things.She had the least tendency to spit these pacifiers out.One downside to these pacifiers is that if they are submerged in soapy water when you are cleaning them, then sometimes some soap ends up inside the silicone part that ends up in the baby's mouth and it is difficult to rinse out the inside of it.Very nice product, I like the fact that you can undo and start over if you don't like what you get!No matter what I did (warmed it, kneaded it etc.)it was wrinkly.It was also impossible to get the clay to spread out evenly and neatly into the spaces with the little wooden dowel they included.I have also been buying plain wooden frames and putting sculpey in them, and while it's not any easier, it's a lot cheaper and the results look a lot better.In the picture part of this frame, there is plastic instead of glass, and mine was scratched.For my daughter's lunches, they're a great size for small portions without taking up too much space in her lunch box.The lids are also tight enough to hold in liquids, so I can use them with moist foods with no problem.I love these snack cups and am buying more.These snack cups are easy to use and easy to clean.And, I love the fact that they are BPA- and Phthalate-free.I chose the Trend Lab Dr. Seuss ABC valances for my nursery because of the colors and also b/c it isn't too thematic, so that you back yourself into a corner.It also can probably last for a child's room up to 4 or 5 years old b/c it doesn't look really "babyish".I washed before putting it on the mattress and the colors didn't fade at all.Love this mattress sheet!This crib sheet matches the full set we purchased off our registry.My only worry is how the sheet holds up after washing - I will update if it fades.It is in no way a rattle, it's way too heavy for my baby, and will be way too heavy until he's over one year old, most likely.There is actually no rattle to this thing at all (as others have mentioned) and although there are speaker holes in the back of the gorilla head, almost no sound will come out unless you shake it very hard, and in a specific way.My husband thinks it's bright and pretty and he told me I shouldn't return it, but I learned my lesson, to read reviews of even the "simplest" things before I buy them.It is suggested below that "teether" and "teething toys" are tags I might want to use.There is nothing on here that a baby would want to use as a teether, and "rattles" also suggested, is part of the name of the toy that so badly mislead me in the first place.No giggles, no rattles, not much of a toy.The only thing this rattle does as advertised is click when the bananas are turned.As others have noted, it neither giggles, makes silly sounds, nor is easy to grasp.It has a very short shelf life too: Within a minute of opening the package, in the garbage it went.Save your $$$.The gorilla has a happy expression and my baby likes to look at it.That is the upside.The downside is that the toy is fairly heavy for a young baby (mine is 5 months), and it doesn't make a rattling sound, despite being called a rattle.I only wish it would have a little more ventilation.Its the only potty I have, but I did shop a lot for this type of product, and I am very satisfied with the construction and durability of the product.It is a good beginning potty, and I think its a good price, too.It is featured on potty videos also - so it really helps her out seeing other little ones using the same potty as well.Deciding between the Baby Bjorn Smart Potty and the Baby Bjorn Potty Chair for my 10 month old boy whose weight is at 75th percentile, I went to a store to compare the two products.Major findings:1.The seat on the Smart Potty is lower.Pros - harder to topple.Cons - if the child is taller the sitting position may be more like squatting.At the store my boy sat on the Potty Chair and decided to reach for something and toppled the Potty Chair.My kid is in the first week of potty training and hasn't had a "mission accomplished" yet, but with a toy in his hands he seems fine sitting on the potty for 5 minutes.My daughter really hasn't used it too much yet, but she seems to enjoy it and it is pretty easy to clean.There is no need to buy an expensive one that does the same job.Wish I had it the day I came home from the hospital!!It's easy to assemble and easy to clean.The toy bar is detachable and the chair bounces easily when the kids kick their feet.This is the only baby feature my husband will let me keep in our living room because it is so cute, but not overly obnoxious looking, like most fisher-price stuff is.Also, the vibrating part requires D batteres, which are not carried in most of the stores I go to.But he seems to really enjoy it.I like it too, because I can sit him in there for about 20 minutes without him being bored.Plus I am obsessed with the music it plays, the songs are stuck in my head ALL day!:) Definitely recommend itI dont know why exactly but this is and always been my babys favorite toy.He still likes it at 7 months old.I like that he learned how to pass things from one hand to the other using this toy, which is an important milestone.I could not have purchased this item for this price at the store!Returned item bacause I ended up buying a big pack of toys for what was a bargain.Once my baby was able to hang on to a toy for any length of time, this became his favorite.He never plays w/ the phone part - I think it's too hard - so look for just the ring - they are sold separately.She was only 2 mo old and once she started hanging on to toys she really loved these!The handles are but perfect for even the tiniest of hands!Once I got the hang of the mechanism I felt safe leaving my stroller while we were off doing other things.The lock did not have to be removed to collapse my stroller.Well he did and he either: hit all the buttons so many times that he broke the mechanism OR changed the code without knowing that he changed the code.Either way I couldn't get the thing unlocked.Luckily for us, Disney came and clipped the wire for us.NOTE TO MOMS: Either don't let your husband unlock it or fully train him on how to unlock it.It does what is claims to do.It is easy to clean, put on/off, and looks good.Additionally, it provides support so that we didn't need to purchase the Stokke baby set.I was expecting a lightweight cheap plastic, but this tray is very well made and cleans easy.It's large and fits real easy on the high chair.No screws or attachments.Just slides on.This review will be much shorter than my typical reviews, since I am very happy with this product and don't really have much to say about it other than it works and it's very handy to have.My wife and I have a 3 month old who bottle feeds infrequently.The Steri-bottle.It's really quite an amazing, yet simple product.I'm surprised that this wasn't invented longer ago.There are 10 sterilized bottles in the box.You just take one out, fill it, put the cap on and you're good to go.When the baby finishes, you can either re-fill it for immediate use, or you can toss it into the recycle container.I don't recommend using this bottle as a long-term solution to bottle-feeding, since long term reusing of a product like this may increase the risk of bacteria build-up.The instructions also recommend using the bottle once and disposing of it.I'm happy with the product.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is that they're pretty expensive if you have to buy this product multiple times.Maybe they'll offer a bulk-pack discount in the future.You simply take a bottle, fill it, and snap on the nipple/cap attachment.Amazingly, these bottles do not leak, and babies can't take off the top and make a mess.I don't have a baby, but my favorite cousin just had one.If you don't mind the price and the toll these will take on the environment, this is a useful product.They are a one-time use product; once the cap is snapped on, it can't be removed.What's the problem with this?At least where I live, you are supposed to rinse products before you put them in the recycle bin.As for the price, you know what you are paying for when you order the product.These bottles fill a niche in the baby product market and are a great thing to have on hand away from home.You pay more for this convenience product, but they are not a frequent use item and I like to have them as an option.While each bottle is indeed a one-time use, they make life easier by saving time and adding bulk to your diaper bag and besides they do not leak and the plastic is thick enough to be strong.Best yet, they are manufactured here in the USA, actually at a local plant near where I live.I really dislike washing bottles.But I was wrong.These disposable bottles did not work for me for several reasons.1.My daughter, who loves her bottles, would not drink out of one.It wasn't that she was full either because after trying to feed her from one of these, I tried out of her normal bottle and she took the milk without a problem.3.They are expensive at $1 each, you really do not want to throw it away after one use.But even if you wanted to, there is no way to reuse one because the lid does not come off.I can see a few instances where it might be nice to have a disposable bottle but not enough to justify the cost and waste of these bottles.I held on to this product for quite a while, almost eight months!My son is now old enough (five months) to be able to use the Steribottle.Any earlier and you'll waste formula or breast milk and annoy baby.Preparing the bottle was easy: rip open the plastic covering on both the base and the nipple, pour the formula or milk into the base and firmly press the nipple top housing onto the base which is capable of holding 10 ounces.The click sound ensures a seal, but for me, when I shook the bottle for further mixing, the formula spilled out of some unknown opening and all over my hand.After making sure the lid was on tightly after that, it functioned normally afterward.There is a small hole near the base of the nipple housing that lets in air as baby sucks; this is important to reduce air intake--babies really don't like having air trapped somewhere.As far as I could tell, the hole worked well and my son had no more issues with burping with the Steribottle as with any other.In fact, for traveling I really like the Steribottle.It's convenient and easy to use although I have to figure out why it leaked when I shook the formula.Apart from that little hiccup, four stars.I thought it would be great to be able to have a few bottles that didn't need to be washed that we could use and toss.We went over to my grandparents house with several of these bottles, some formula mix and one Dr. Brown's bottle that had just a little milk left in it.Thank goodness we took the Dr. Brown's bottle because our 5 month old refused to drink from this bottle.The nipple is much harder plastic than the soft silicone.Not quite sippy cup material but harder for her to drink out of than her "Tommy Tippie" transitional sippy cup.I did not have the issue with not being able to remove and reseal the bottle.Fine for 6 months + but I would not even attempt with an infant.I will keep and try again in a few months.These disposable bottles are so handy for travels with baby - even if only to Grandmas house!If you want, you can pump and leave a fresh bottle with your Mom and take off.Great for pumping at work, also, because they store right in your desk, are already sterile and ready to go.Its hard to think of a better, more handy baby bottle to have in the diaper bag.Can I ask what the point is???Why buy a bottle that can't be reused?Has society really come to this point?Use and toss is such a waste.At about $1, you may as well buy Evenflow bottles and through them out everytime you use them.Or go to the dollar store and stock up just so you can trash them after each use.SAD.These "disposable" bottles are handy in a pinch.I carry one around in my diaper bag with ready-to-use formula.When you open the box you find individually wrapped and sterilized bottles ready to use with your formula or other baby beverage of choice.The construction is not so durable that you can re-use them for a long time, but they certainly will stand up to a few uses.As someone who relies on public transit a lot, and thus lacks the convenience of stowing things in a car much of the time, I can't believe it took this long for a product like this to make it to the USA!The name of the product pretty much says it all..."Steribottle" -- sterile bottles, sealed in a plastic bag.Unfortunately, all of the bottles were sealed in plastic together (the nipples sealed individually), so they are not truly sterile after you open it to use the first one."Ready to Use" -- yes, they really are.There are no drop-ins to worry about; they're new, so no cleaning necessary."Disposable" -- yes, again, you can dispose of them.If recycling is available, that seems to be a better solution.If they are exactly what they advertise, why not 5 stars?But if they went on sale/clearance or you could buy them in bulk, you may find the price bearable.Also, the only nipple flow level I have found is the "3 drop" fast-flow level for ages 3+ month; it would be nice to have a slow-flow one as well.The product is not for everyone, but I can definitely see the appeal.As for the wasteful nature of the product, it seems like the same argument for cloth vs. disposable diapers.These are really nice and very handy.They come well packaged and already completely sterilized, so it really saves on time when you're in a rush.I like the big size too, so they work for little babies, or babies who will drink a full bottle.They would even work for toddlers with juice or older kids by just using the bottle part without the nipple.Even though they are disposable, I feel like they can be used more than once, but that's just me.I bought these burp cloths when I was pregnant just because they were cute and I wanted to buy some baby stuff.These turned out to be my favorite of the different types of burp cloths I have.I have washed them several times, and the pattern has not faded.I think the terry cloth keeps the spit up from running all over the place.I'm buying more of these.Our baby has reflux issues and is a spit-up queen, so we desperately needed more burp clothes.We'd been using some prefold diapers, but wanted something that looked a bit nicer.Some friends had given us Babylicious burp clothes in a gift set, and those were too small and the flannel backing was cheap, plus they constantly came out of the wash wrinkled (and who wants to iron a burp cloth?).The Trend Lab burp cloths are nicer than the Babylicious cloths.On the other hand, they aren't huge; that can be an advantage if you want something to put in a diaper bag, but is a disadvantage if you have a child who spits up a lot, as they get soaked pretty quickly.All in all, the cheapest and most absorbent option for a burp cloth is still a prefold diaper -- plus they are great soft cloths for household use once they baby's outgrown them.I'm not sure you'd want to use one of the nicer Trend Lab cloths as a rag.They're more expensive, but they're big and can also be used as a bib.I was thinking of getting this before my baby was born but decided not to because I thought..."he's not going to be using the infant seat very long so I'll buy a convertible seat instead and use that in my second car".The infant carrier is so much easier to use because we can just take him in and out of the car without hassle and put him in the shopping cart or stroller...especially when he is sleeping.We rarely even use the convertible.We'll probably use it when he gets older.I make a game out of brushing her teeth (no toothpaste, yet) with it and it makes her laugh every time.She is almost 9 months old now and still loves it.The only bad thing about this product is that due to the material that it is made of, it attracts dust, dirt, and hair like you wouldn't believe.And with the little handles, you can attach a paci clip to it so it won't hit the floor when out and about!These are inexpensive and technically they work as liners.But they're SO THIN and flimsy, they irritate me.The fleece is only on one side.They are literally just cut up pieces of fleece.As a liner, they work when I use creams that will mess up my cloth diapers, but I'd rather pay a little extra and get a nice, thicker liner.They sell fleece liners that are substantially more durable and two-sided.Maybe they'll surprise me and end up being really durable, but I'd rather just cut up old T-shirts and use those if I want something this flimsy.I registered for this Ergo carrier after a friend of mine recommended it to me and I received it for my baby shower.I saw so many of my friends use it too and their babies seemed to really like being in it.I also ordered the infant insert to go with it.My baby boy liked being in the Ergo with the infant insert the first couple of weeks I put him in it.When my baby was in it with the infant insert, it was like he was sitting in the insert and his legs would be in front of my stomach.I couldn't use the infant insert anymore, but he hated spreading his legs so that they would stick out of the sides of the carrier.I'd be able to get one leg out, but then the other leg would be hitting my stomach.He's not big enough yet to spread his legs out all the way out the sides.The Bjorn has holes for the legs to go straight down.I'm hoping that once he's bigger, he'll like it.I'm going to keep trying to use it, but unfortunately, he's at the ackward stage and isn't really comfortable in it.UPDATE:  My baby is 4 months old and 17.5 lbs and STILL does not like the Ergo because he doesn't like to spread his legs that far apart (and I'm very thin!)I got the K'Tan carrier instead and my baby enjoys it and it doesn't hurt my back like the Bjorn.This is the BEST baby carrier, bar none!!The Ring Slings (hurts your shoulder, difficult to adjust at times), Moby Wrap (okay for a little baby, but hot, and a bit complicated for on-the-go), Baby Bjorn Style (hurts your shoulders, and BAD FOR BABY'S SPINE- yikes!!).I had almost given up until a cousin turned me on to the Ergo.As babies, they are always falling asleep in it, whether around the house, on shopping errands, or long strolls and hikes.I have worn it for 2 hours at a time (maybe more!)It really does distribute the weight on your waist/hips.She actually wants to get in it!I can put our baby in it front style while I push our toddler in the jogging stroller.)- or we'd be stuck inside and we'd all go stir crazy ;) I always take it with me as our baby is 3 months old and it is so easy to put him in the Ergo while I grocery shop or anything.I hate to just leave him strapped in his car seat when he could be cuddled close to me or daddy in a snap.I am very surprised that anyone would think that the ergo baby was difficult to put on, or as another reviewer said that you must have two people to use it.Maybe they gave up after trying it once or twice.I don't know.I have never had any problems using this, either with a 18 pound 3 month old or my 36 lb 2 1/2 year old.It takes awhile to "get used to" (maybe a couple times, if that) but after that, it's a breeze!I haven't ever tried the "side hip carry" because on the front or when they got older the back worked fine.I believe I began putting our daughter on the back when she was 7 or 8 months old (and 25 lbs) and after doing it a couple times with my husband (just in case) I felt totally confident doing it on my own.A lot of times I did it right by my bed just in case.Sometimes it takes a bit of umph to snap the clasp that holds the straps together (it will be between your shoulder blades for a front carry) but it is not by any means impossible.It will makes carrying your baby or toddler a piece of cake, wherever you are.You won't be disappointed!I really like this carrier!I can see why some people say it is difficult to get on, although I haven't found it to be so.For front carry, you snap the chest/shoulder strap behind you (between your shoulder blades).If you don't have a lot of flexibility in your arms, that can be difficult.You can then tighten the shoulder straps and it will go down your back.It may be difficult to get undone, but you can loosen things and it will help.2.In the instructions, they explain how you can do it up and then put it over your head.I haven't tried this (because my way works for me) but it is an option.My husband is so happy to have something that is much simpler to put on than a Moby or wrap style carrier.I love that the baby does not hang by their crotch, and it's comfortable to wear!We also have a home-made wrap style carrier, which I like for if I am encouraging sleep, because you can just tuck the baby's head in and they are cocooned.Because the baby's head is more loose, the Ergo is much better for looking around and being out and about.I know daycare tries hard to keep track of which belongs to who, but it's not always easy with 5 toddlers running around.I wanted to put it in the middle of the cup where it's narrower.They stay on great, and we've never had any trouble with them coming off.They fit well on our Playtex Twist n Click straw sippy cups.I wrote my boys' names on the bands with pen and boiled them to make them permanent, as indicated by the instructions.Other than that, I think they're good.After reading many reviews i finally decided on this one.I'm glad i bought this one for the following reasons:- I like how i can put both carseats and switch to the attachable seats when they are older- I love how there is plenty of room to put their huge diaper bag and room for more- I like that i can turn the seats facing me or each other or facing forward- I like that its easy to push and steer- I like that it was easy to put together all by myself (7 months pregnant at the time)The only thing negative i would say is when i put both boys facing each other their legs would touch, so i'm guessing it wont be long when they start kicking each other, or there wont be any room to face each other.I read lots of reviews before buying it and went with the older red model rather than the newer one because the new model was sold out but I'm glad I did.One of the main reasons I choose this stroller was the size of the basket.The basket is plenty big for day long outings or afternoons of shopping.It's very easy to place a diaper bag in and get to it easily.My concerns about buying it were a) it would be so huge that it would be very heavy and/or difficult to push, b) the seats would be too small to be used for long, and c) it would be difficult to fit in a vehicle.Both concerns have turned out to be non-issues.It takes up less room lengthwise than the duo glider did but sits up higher, especially with the second seat sitting on top of it.I read several reviews that said it wouldn't fit behind the third row of a minivan but I've had no problem at all, it fits with room left over.I have three complaints.The first is that one of the pins that holds the front wheel section on the main frame broke while I was assembling it.Third, I called kolcraft before I ordered it to ask how tall the handle is and was told 40".It's actually 43", it's 40" before the wheels are put on.I'm on the shorter side and a 43" handle is not nearly as comfortable for me to push as a lower one, there is not height adjustment for the handle.I probably still would have bought it but I wish I had been told the correct handle height.***UPDATE IS AT THE VERY BOTTOM***My husband and I do Love this stroller but we've realized there are some major things missing that other strollers have.It doesn't state that there is a feeding tray so I can't be mad about it, I'm just trying to let people who probably don't think about things like that know.Another thing we never thought of.There are many places you will go where there is no convenient or clean place to change a baby.My best friends stroller folds completely flat so you can change a baby, we ended up using her stroller to change our girls at the Zoo.We always put the bigger of our girls in the back and she's constantly kicking the canopy since it falls on her legs.Not a huge deal but certainly annoying for the back rider.*They always have to be strapped in which makes them really hot.This wasn't as big of a deal when my girls were smaller and couldn't hold themselves up as well but now that they can they don't like to be strapped down, they end up getting really fussy because they get really hot.Again, my best friends seat has a bar between the legs so she doesn't have to be strapped in.I started just strapping the waist & crotch strap on them instead of the arm straps too.I tried not strapping them in but the way the seats are they just fall right out the bottom.PROS*Turning the seats any direction is really handy, especially if it's really sunny out, you can turn them away from the sun.(it would be even more handy if you didn't have to take the seat off to do this, if you could just swivel the seat w/them in it)*Reclining Seats.They don't recline so you can change a diaper but they do recline so they can take a nap.You just pull on the handle at the top of the seat and easily recline them.My girls have taken many naps in this, definately a plus.BOTH of these seats recline the same and have several different levels of recline, a lot of double strollers only have 1 reclining seat or 1 just barely reclines so one kid gets a comfy reclined nap and the other wouldn't.*All Terrain Wheels.We've had this on every kind of terrain and its usually pretty darn easy to push, gravel, grass, hills, woods, nothing has been a problem yet.This thing is solid & very durable, both the frame & the material.Definately something that will last a very long time.In our case, not having the feeding trays and having to strap them in all the time are the biggest cons & the main reason I took off 2 stars.My message to Kolcraft: This would be the perfect stroller with just a few changes/additions.I've noticed with the new Contours Options II that the seats are supposed to be roomier, thats a plus.Also that the umbrellas adjust, another plus.Now if you would just make a feeding tray and have a strap/bar between the legs so older babies/toddlers didn't have to be strapped in, you would have the Perfect stroller...at least in my opinion :)Let me know if you have any questions about this and I'll try to help you out : )***UPDATE***As I am writing this(Jan 2012) update my girls are 3 years old and we no longer have the stroller because we sold it at a garage sale last summer.I just really did NOT enjoy taking it places because it was SO long and my girls normally complained when they were in it(from lack of being able to see mainly)After having 'been there, done that' I can tell you 100% if I had to do it all over again, I would have bought a side by side stroller.The main reason I started looking at tendems is because I wanted to make sure it was narrow enough to fit it aisles and doorways(yes, first time Mom, ALL of it was new to me, rookie mistake, lol)But since they make side by side strollers that CAN fit thru doorways and aisles, plus they have lots of other great features of a single stroller, how can you go wrong?Not all side by sides are made the same but I have found several that are narrow to fit in doorways/aisles, have a food tray/cup holder, BOTH seats can fully recline and you can have them reclined at different levels(like newborn reclined flat, toddler sitting up) roomy seats, don't have to be strapped in all the time, has storage for diaper bag, not as long as a limo ;)And another great, great thing about a side by side, the kids would be side by side!They can share snacks, talk, share toys, etc.With a tandem, at least one of them always has a crappy seat, unless you have them face eachother, then neither of them get to see anything besides eachother, and although they are probably really cute(I'm sure the cutest kids on earth ;)) I think kids would probably rather be able to look out and about rather than at eachother the whole time.The breakaway clasp is essential and I am glad they thought of it.This is a great Mommy tool!It has saved me from a fussy so many times.I wear it anytime I go out.It's very pretty!It would be prefect if my kid didn't hate it so much, but I don't know that anyone has a product that will fix that.I have found that short, quick, successive sucks work better for us most of the time and seem to bother him less.After I have the booger to the edge of his nostril I usually have to use a tissue to finish the job.Bottom line, nose cleaning can be unpleasant, but at least I actually getting his nose clean with this rather than just torturing him with a bulb sucker.It's gross and it works.The benefits outweigh the grossness!My kids can breath so it's all good!When I first read how to use the nosefrida, I literally gagged.But after needing to use it on my baby, it is not an issue at all!It is actually fun to see the junk come out of our LO's nose and see him feel instantly better.Strange, but hey, he feels so much better!Love this product and would buy again.I got this product for my 5 months old when she developed a cold.I cant argue with the fact that it cleans the nose very well-better than any nasal bulb.But, she is terrified of it and becomes very agitated when we put it next to her nose.She used to be fine with me using saline spray to clean her nose prior to me using the nosefrida on her, now she doesnt let me come near her nose at all!I use cheap zip-locs in the bottom and so I can zip and dump on the go.I keep this open in the back of the van or car, and have used it camping in a corner of the tent.Handy.Everything locks into place very well, so that it's sturdy enough for a child to sit on (not sure how much weight it will hold).The only drawback for me is that I have difficulty unlocking the storage areas.But I generally leave the potty set up in the trunk of the van, and leave the storage area with the extra ziploc bags ajar (doesn't affect sturdiness) so that I can quickly get it ready.I have ziploc bags in one storage area, and plastic grocery bags in the other so that I can put used ziplocs in a bag ... don't need to be seen walking around with a bag of pee.I should've listened to other reviews and passed on this purchase.The cup leaks so it isn't worth the money I spent.I received this in green, wish it would have been blue, but at least green is still a boyish color.My baby has no problem eating out of them when we are out and about.I still spoon feed him at home and don't use these there, but these make life much easier if we are out on the weekends so he doesnt make such a mess and need clothing changed.When I put cereal in his bottle before, he had a hard time sucking it out of the nipple because they aren't made for something that thick to go through.So I just put some of his formula in this with cereal, he eats that, then the rest in the bottle before bed.Our 3 month old is 12.5 pounds.We got the "big baby" size because the packaging and the product page say different weight ranges.One says that this size starts at 14 pounds and one at 11.However, 14 is more likely, as it is much too big!Sizing is key for this product, and there seems to be a mid-range in between the two sizes where neither is just right.We've used the swaddleme for both of our children, and swear by it.On the other hand, I tend to not get the swaddleme fastened tight enough.We tend to use the woombie for naps and the swaddleme at night when we want to make sure she stays asleep!I received a Ballet Pink Ruffles Deluxe Woombie for free for my baby girl to try out and for me to review.I found the Woombie to be what I was looking for in a swaddler.The Deluxe Woombie has the advantage of being super cute, but unfortunately doesn't come in the Convertable or Leggie styles.My little girl seemed to like the Woombie and fell asleep in it.Pros:- Keeps baby swaddled and does not unravel.- Keeps baby from scratching face- Fairly easy to use- Machine washable- Fabric tab covers the zipper foot- Multiple sizes availableCons:- Sizes run slightly small- Pricier than a blanket- Possible rolling hazard.(See explanation in review below.)Neutrals:- Only one zipper that goes from legs to neck- Line drying recommended- Wish there was another size bigger than Mega baby.The Woombie saved my sanity and allowed me to sleep without worrying about a scratched-up baby.I found the Woombie when the baby was six months old, had outgrown or overcome other swaddling blankets, and was escaping 10 times a night.After putting the baby in the Woombie, the difference was amazing.Ten to 13 hours of uninterrupted sleep.I wish we found the Woombie a lot sooner.The second biggest advantage, besides the sleep, is that it keeps the baby from scratching her face, which is itchy from eczema.We've tried the Miracle blanket and other swaddling techniques, but the baby could escape those or lift the fabric, causing suffocation hazards.The baby cannot escape from the Woombie at all, as long as we are using the correct size.The biggest concern with any secure swaddling technique is if a baby has difficulty turning his head to the side or returning to his back while on his stomach.He could get stuck with his face down.If it doesn't work, then probably not much else will.---9/4/2010 Update: The makers of the Woombie now sell variations of this swaddle.They now have two-way zippers that allow changing of the diaper without the baby's hands getting loose.)3/30/2011 Update: I understand that the velcro neck clasp has been replaced with button snaps again on the newer versions.8/31/2011 Update: Shortly before the baby outgrew the Woombie, I found the ScratchSleeves product from the UK which has been a second lifesaver in keeping the baby's scratching from doing too much harm.It looks so tight it scares me but there is no way for her to get her arms out of this.If your baby needs to be swaddled this is the one to get don't waste your money on all of the others.One thing the picture shows cotton candy as pink.The one I got looks like it's peach.I love this high chair.It is very cute and made very well with many different features.It does really help both mom and baby in dining time.Sturdy and stable, the high chair is good for you to put your baby on it.Not easy to assembly the item, but you can enjoy doing that.I've seen this in action and it's a great concept.So much more cute and attractive than the plain child harness and definately better than the bracelets from 20 years ago.It is a great thing to have if your child simply can't or won't hold your hand and tends to wander off.Many parents don't want to tether their child because they may view it as "leash like".However, those of us who have children know that there are kids who simply won't behave, won't hold hands and won't listen.We ofter use the backpack alone, as the harness is not often necessary.It is a bit difficult to open the bag when my daughter is wearing it and it doesn't hold much, but other than that, no complaints.It is a very handy thing to have around when it is needed.My daughter's 17 mths old and I am still using these pads, you will find all sorts of ways and reasons to use them.I will prob also use one in car seat when I start potty traning.this are very durable and a most have for changing tables and the diaper bag.However, they are half the price of other covers.You'll want to have several covers on hand and these are good for the budget.You can't beat $14 for 2 changing pad covers (plus free shipping, although this isn't always an option).The outer part (the ivory dot part) is just basic cotton fabric, nothing special, but is on the side anyway so baby doesn't have to lie on it.I definitely recommend this but get a few since you'll need to change them often.The ergo is, by far, our favorite carrier for our 1-year-old daughter.We've tried a bunch and always come back to this one.I'm a first-time mom and didn't really know whether I would need the sucking pads for my Ergobaby.I have a black Ergobaby so the baby's spit left a lot of whitish residue on the straps.I had to wash the Ergobaby often to keep it clean, and this caused the carrier to start fading a bit.Now I just throw these in the wash after each use and feel much better knowing my daughter is sucking on clean, organic sucking pads, and the Ergobaby (worthwhile, but still an investment) will stay looking newer for longer.We searched for a long time for a Glider, both on and off of amazon.com.Putting the glider together was a very simple affair.The instructions are clear, and it took me approximately 20 minutes from unboxing the glider to having it fully assembled.It is a very comfortable glider, and the padding on the seat, backrest and arms rests are plush and soft.The ottoman portion is good, albeit a little clunky to move around with a baby in your arms!The ottoman is not really needed all that much, probably only when you are in the glider for an extended period of time as the chair portion alone is plenty comfortable.I took one star off of the review because of this.Probably a little harsh, and would be better if i could have taken a half of a star away.In conclusion, a great buy from amazon.com for the price, and brand name.My baby is 8 months old and we have been using Dr. Browns.They work great but I am tired of washing all the bits and pieces.I bought the MAM bottles for these reasons:1. they were 11 ounces - plenty big2.they fit in my cooler bagI got them home and I don't really like them because:1.The nipple collapses and my baby can't drink.It's 11 oz so a lot bigger than our baby currently uses, but I like that it will be useable for a longer period of time.Nowhere in the description does it claim that this bottle is an Ultivent, so I'm not sure what they're complaining about.This is my 3rd hamper in this type (3rd baby so new stuff each time).They are also on the bottom of the hamper too.Also this one comes with a mesh/net style liner for easy removal of clothes and i hope to keep the "pretty" part of the hamper from getting soiled and needing to be washed as often.Hence me trying this bag.I actually haven't decided yet if I'm keeping it...and am hoping that by writing this review, I will make a decision.PROS?* I like the flat bottom so that it stays upright (something my current bag doesn't have).* Even with the inner pockets filled, there is still room on the bottom (well, in the center) to put more things like toys or books (if you haven't already put them in the pockets).* It doesn't look like a diaper bag!Granted the one I got does have a big red heart on it so hubby might not be thrilled to carry it (vs. the all black one we have now) but I figure I'm the one using it 95% of the time, so he can live with the heart.CONS?* I dislike the "bow tie" closure.You can't do it one-handed and it doesn't close the bag.While it's nice to be able to look and reach in quick for something without having to unzip, because it's tied closed, it's not real easy to actually get something out.I will likely never use it and am contemplating cutting it off.Just know that there is no way to seal off the entire bag.They're just your basic flimsy polyester gym bag type handles.They have no no-slip gripper or padding of any kind plus they are kind of thin so they get twisted easily.Since they aren't adjustable, I'd much rather have stiffer round straps (I can't think of how to describe them, so look at this bag to see what I mean:Diaper Tote Bag Brown/Beige) that just fall to the side instead of getting tangled up in each other.Yes, I realize it's most likely done that way because of the included changing pad (which is folded to fit in that section) but the changing pad is so thin that it can easily be folded in half again and would fit just as well if the one big pockets was turned into two pockets.I'd rather have specific pockets.OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NEITHER PRO NOR CON FOR ME?This isn't a critical thing for me since I have insulated sippy cups, but if you want insulation, this has none.* I'm not sure how to use the rings.The product features says "Rounded loop for easy key, cell phone, and stroller attachment" but I don't see how any of those "attachments" are possible without an additional product to make the connection.Other bags I've had have actual circular velcro tabs that will attach to a stroller OR an across-the-chest strap that will fit over a stroller handle...not so with this bag.And there's no way I could hook my keys to that ring without a caribiner clip or something.Or have a special case for my cell phone to allow that.Maybe I'm missing something, but I just don't get it.That said, it doesn't really affect my use of the bag at all.So overall it's a nice bag and does a few things I like but has a few flaws as well.Do I like it better than my current bag?It's a toss up, because I do miss the shoulder strap...but I love that it will sit on its own.Is this bag better than others I have used?This bag is really roomy and can hold quite a bit.But is this bag worth $40?For the moment, yes---but I think I'll test it for another few days just in case.Bear is cute but the quality is not good for the price.The threads keep unraveling which is not only unattractive, but a tangle hazard.I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it.Too bad :&lt;We bought this seat after our Primo Ducka potty seat finally wore out after nearly two years of use.There is a handle on the back of the seat for hanging when not in use.While our toilet seat is a standard sized round seat, the WeePod has to be tightly wedged on the toilet seat each time, which is a bit difficult for my toddler to do by himself.The WeePod has an adjustment knob for the rubber "feet" that hold the seat to the toilet, but even on its smallest setting, it still barely fits our toilet.Overall, this is a quality seat and my son likes using it, but I wish the feet were able to be adjusted a bit further.Update (11/29/12): After about 2.5 years of daily use by our boys, the rubber hanging handle finally broke, and some of the seat's rubber is a bit discolored, so we are buying a new Prince Lionheart weePOD (this time, Mommy is choosing poppy pink!).I purchased these for the corners of my large wooden coffee table.They adhere to the table well, don't leave marks, and protect the corners well (they are large and very padded).I don't have to worry about my new little walker hitting her head with these corner guards on the table.Both bouncers are terrific, but in completely different ways.The Infantino bouncer is of very high quality construction with music, vibration mode, and hanging toys that are a bit better than my Fisher Price.The Infantino also has better padding and seems much more high tech and full featured.It looks like a "luxury" bouncer.I like the Fischer Price model a little bit better for its "bouncy" springy metal legs, but if you travel or seek a bouncer with better sounds/music, vibration mode, and padding this Infantino is a better choice.and it still looks brand new.My finicky daughter dislikes her swing, but loves this vibrating chair and cries when it turns off after 20 minutes.I would agree with other reviewers that this is probably not the greatest seat for undeveloped necks.Although this is much like many bouncer chairs on the market, it is different as that it folds up small.It is also padded well.It didnt work for nither the new born nor older kid.Some how it never worked, looked nice after assembling but it was a big miss.If you have hard wood floors, the vibrating metal frame could be a big annoyance.But should not have any issues in carpet.Wish they had put in a little bit more thought and field study before releasing the product.Going back to fisher price bouncers.New to parenting?This is one device that is a must for at least, say, eight months of your baby's first year, probably more.This is a very portable, easy to store, commendably-built bouncer.It is comfy, easy to clean, and great for napping.It is sturdy and attractive and my baby seems pretty comfy in it, which is the most important aspect of this product.The bouncer is also pretty unisex so boy or girl-it doesn't matter!The melodies it plays are soothing and the vibration is nice too, though I'm pretty sure most bouncers come with that anyway.This one...this was "the one" that did the trick!He will pull it out, look it over, adjust it (sliding it around a little ) & then try again.Even at 4 months he already had me doing the mad toy chase trying to find out what the whine was all about...this was the solution.it works well as it also fits on his arm and he can wear it and play with it so he doesnt drop it so easily.i also liked that it was made in USAGood enough teether but nothing special, although nothing has really stood out so it's as good as most.It definitely doesn't chill at all and their claims about wearing it as a bangle are better in description than practice.We found the silicone so sticky that it gets covered with lint quickly.Worth the money though.The teether is extremely pliable, so it does not have that hard impact most teethers have.It can be worn as a bracelet so you can quickly hand it to a cranky baby.With a new baby coming, this is great to save a little money!It is compatible with my summer infant day and night monitor (2500).i am able to switch between channels "A" ( my daughters room) and Chanel "B" for the babys room with out any problems or interference.We have had it for 2 years with out any problemsMy husband and I decided, after dealing with waking my daughter up to check on her  at night, that with our second child we'd get a video monitor.I had received the summer infant day and night flat screen monitor set back in June 2008 for my baby shower.We've had no problems.We live in a neighborhood with close houses and we also have cell phones and wireless internet and nothing sees to interfere.The microphone is very powerful so if you have a sound machine in your childs room you will hear it loudly on the monitor just to let you know.We are very happy with this product.There is a minimal static but the camera works good and the mic also works very well.It required nothing special to get it to work, no programming or anything just turn it on and select A or B (which ever isn't on the other camera).Then your done, cut on your monitor and switch to the letter you selected and you see it.This isn't a big issue however, because there is only a height limit for use on a plane, not for its many other uses.My daughter is in the 97th percentile for height at 30 inches tall, and her head came up a good 2.5 inches past the line.Basically the FlyeBaby served as a little extra support and reassurance that my daughter wasn't going to fall backwards off my lap.It also gave her an even surface to sit on.Last thing you need is a little bit of turbulence and baby hitting their head.Use on a chair:This product proved so extremely helpful on our trip.It rolls up super small so I was able to toss it in the diaper bag and quickly install it on chairs at the hotel, in restaurants etc and give her both a place to eat and a place to play.This product has replaced the need to bring any extra gear along when visiting friends' houses.We used to always bring her Bumbo or her swing, but now we can just bring this and she can sit right at the table with us.Overall:This product is extremely easy to install and remove.I'm talking 1 minute the first time you ever use it, and 10-20 seconds once you're accustomed to it.I am able to install it even with a squirmy baby on one hip.The material is durable and is not showing any signs of wear even with how much my baby moves around on it, pulls the straps etc.The price is a little over kill to me considering how simple a design it is, but there is nothing quite like this on the market so they could really charge a million bucks for it if they wanted to.And if you think about it, this can easily replace the need for a high chair altogether, so you could save money ultimately.I highly recommend this product.It has everything you could possibly want in a stroller.I like the way it is so light weight, but the wheels seem a little cheap.and the cup holders for us are kinda awkward.I recently picked this up at a consignment shop (used) and it is really great!I initially had a Graco travel system stroller that I loved at first, then began to hate it.So, I've been using a Maclaren - little wheels are horrible outside, very bumpy ride, storage area is useless, but it is light and folds up so little.And, if I hang a bag off the handles, it tips over when my son gets out.THIS stroller is lightweight, has LOTS of very well-thought-out features (side net pockets on the canopy!big basket!netting in the surround when reclined for air-flow!AND, it truly folds with just one hand!!).This stroller, new, is less than half of what I paid for either of the other 2 stollers, and I love it so much more!After doing a lot of research and reading lots of reviews we decided on this Jeep Stroller.So far we're happy with our purchase, but there are a few things that I would change.- It is not all that high.We're using this for our 5 1/2 month old who can't really sit up yet, so I get nervous about him falling forward.- The padding on the side does seem kind of rough and when the seat is reclined it would be very easy for my little guy to hit his head on the hard bars that you can feel through the cover.I read another review stating the same thing, but didn't think to much of it because others hadn't commented, but this was actually the first thing that my husband noticed once we put the stroller together.We put blankets on the side of our little guy to protect him from hitting his head.Now the pro's:It is very lightweight and easy to put together.After assembling our Jeep stroller, I happened to be at Sears and noticed the Kolcraft stroller there and have to say I'm glad we went with the Jeep stroller.I recently found a steal at a garage sale for a Chicco umbrella stroller that retails in the $89 price range.The Jeep is SO much better!The only difference I saw that I liked between the Jeep and Chicco is that the handles on the Chicco were a little bit higher up for those that might be taller.All in all, you CANNOT go wrong with this Jeep stroller!I wanted to buy an umbrella stroller for our daughter because though our Other stroller was great it was a bit large and heavy, I did my research and found this stroller on line, I desided to order it.It is soooo light weight and YES!you can do it with one hand.For the price this stroller has all the features of a large expensive stroller but weighs what a small umbrella strollers do.Being in south florida the shade is a must, and being able to do it with one hand is a must too.I am 5'7'' and this stroller is tall enough too, some of the cheap ones short , this one is not, hand down I would recomend this to any parent that wants a light weight, inexpensive, good quality one!I have gone through umbrella and bulky strollers and needed something easier to haul around since I'm a mom of 4.I bought the stroller for my 2 yr old to use at the mall or grocery store trips and recently my 9 yr old pushed it the entire time at Target.I was able to fit two water bottles in them.I was also able to steer it with one hand while holding groceries in another, have never been able to do that with another stroller!I LOVE this stroller and for the price plan on buying another one for my newest baby.OK, so I looked and looked and LOOKED at travel strollers....like, for two months I comparatively shopped at every store on the planet, it seemed.I thought I'd be more mad about my $125 Chicco stroller getting ruined than my $45 Jeep stroller getting ruined.Plus, my brother in law has the Chicco and the seat support has torn through the seat on it and my niece has to sit on a metal pole.It handles really well, the basket underneath is big (I store my bag hanging over the handles so we just used the bottom for extra goodies but it is seriously big enough for whatever you're doing for the day), and it reclines which was important to me because my son was in the stroller for long periods of time as we were at Disneyland and he's one.I read in other reviews that the stroller does not clamp together.It does, in fact, do that very thing.It's just you have to look a little harder to find where it latches.Anywho.It's very lightweight, it drives really nice, it could be a tad taller in the handles but it was fine, and the shade worked great.It is a little lighter in color where the baby sits, and my poor kiddo was sweaty and actually left a sweat ring in the stroller while he was sleeping.Definitely worth the money though.We're keeping it in Dad's car as a backup.There is no top harness to help hold baby in.strollers have this.Already she tries to bite the tray bc she can (again, with the other strollers not a problem.)Because of the no harness, she slips from side to side.I had to pad the sides so her head wasn't on the hard poles and plastic.Shop around first!However, after about 5 uses, I purchased a Fisher Price Healthy Care booster seat (at less than half the cost of the Fast Chair) and am going to sell the Fast Chair and hope I can recoup some of the cost.These are the reasons the Fast Chair did not work for us:  it doesn't work on tables with a skirt, on pedestal tables, or on glass tables.That rules out the vast majority of restaurant tables, many of which have a central pedestal.It rules out our glass table on our back patio, and many other tables we've wanted to use it on.You also can't use it over a tablecloth, so in a restaurant with a cloth you have to fold it back to hook on the chair and it gets awkward, especially when your little angel tries to grab a handful of the cloth and yank the whole thing off the table.I also underestimated the usefulness of a tray in containing a self-feeder's mess.All over the Fast Chair's fabric, and stuck along the edges of the rubber arms.With the Fisher Price booster, the little tray contains her mess and keeps it off the table.Also, the plastic of the Fisher Price chair just wipes clean, much easier than trying to pry dried mashed banana, etc, out of the Fast Chair's fabric folds.I find set-up for the Fisher Price chair is quicker than for the Fast Chair, and it folds up for travel and even has an over-the-shoulder carry strap, and weighs about the same as the Fast Chair (they are both very light).We took the Fisher Price booster on a trip recently and used it on all sorts of chairs and didn't encounter one it wouldn't fit.When she's ready to stop flinging her food everywhere, I can use the Fisher Price chair as without the tray and pull her right up to the table.Finally, my little girl seems to LOVE the Fisher Price booster, I set it down on the floor recently when we came back from a trip and she climbed right in a sat down and wanted her dinner right than and there!It is a bit of a hassle to set up when we arrive at a restaurant, but it is well worth it, as an alternative to those disgusting restaurant provided high chairs.Cheaper version of the same kind of product wouldn't fit my table at all.I purchased this a few weeks ago to replace our Phil and Teds Me Too chair.The metal squared off clamps weren't doing it for us.Pros:Stylish- fits my home decorComfort- very cushy for bouncing baby boy.Harness- well constructed, goes around belly vs. over shoulders (which inevitably fall down)Cleanable- machine washable, but wipes down really nicely.Arm clamps- a nice rounded rubber material that grips our island bar-top very well, without damage.It has reverse "teeth" on the underside of the clamps to ensure a snug clamp.High Back- says it all- no uncomfortable underlying metal bars.Everything is covered with padding.Join In!- My little man loves to sit down with us for dinner and chats as well as watch the momma cook up a storm in the kitchen.(P&Ts; chair is VERY slim and collapses in on itself nicely, fyi)Cons- the process of getting the cover off is a little involved, but def not a deal breaker.Overall- great piece of baby gear.Saving us from having to buy one of those over-priced eye-sores of a highchair.Great price for what you get.Granny likes it so much she's buying one for her house.4/11- updateStill holding up beautifully.It gets machine washed and left to air dry at least every other week.Untwist the arms, pull the stow over the seat, cinch it down and go.We love this chair.It quickly attaches to a range of surfaces.We have attached it to both our (very thick) stone tile countertop and our (very thin) dining room table.As far as I'm concerned, it is infinitely superior to other high chair options.The fact that she is attached to the table makes it more like she's sitting with us, which she seems to enjoy.She can sit across the island from me while I cook (so nice).And it takes up next to no room.I'm totally sold!I just received this highchair in the mail today and installed it by myself in a matter of seconds!After trying to jiggle the chair around I found that it wouldn't budge for anything!Also, all those other bulky highchairs are over a hundred dollars for a heap of cheap plastic!This chair is definitely worth the money!We bought it for our 5 month old who still can't sit up all the way on his own, yet he did great in the chair!This chair is definitely a winner!We are now on our second child, and this chair is still going strong.The cover unclips so easily from the metal structure, and can be thrown right into the wash.My almost one year old smears food everywhere, and the chair wipes clean.My only complaint was how much food would get stuck under the arms of the chair that attaches to the top of the table.It makes cleanup a lot easier.This chair rocks!I, on the other hand, had no intentions of purchasing a clunky full-size high chair because A) I live in a condo B) one less thing to store C) less wasted plastic D) my baby gets to eat with us at the table or island.We tried it for the first time today, as my son is 6 months old and just started sitting up on his own.My baby loved sitting up high where he could see me and play with his toys at the same time.I just pulled it out of the box and hooked it on - no assembly required.I read the manual and it said there is a built-in travel bag which I have not tested yet, but that was just an added bonus.We took it to Buffalo Wild Wings (restaurant) and it was packed so we were seated in the bar with high table, which was fine with this seat.Under the seat we pushed in the chair and we were in and out and did not have to wait for a table and a restaurant high chair.We have only been using these spoons a few days but I love them!We had been using soft tip spoons with a metal handle and while they served us well, I was always nervous when my son wanted to play with them.These spoons erase those worries!Yes, they do stain but that doesn't really bother me.Unfortunately, the spoon was too big and too deep.Save your money, and buy the the NUK/Gerber spoon.Yes, it does stain, as any sort of plastic spoon will stain with beta carotene.But it's such a great spoon to use.It has a really large and long (6.5 inches) handle that is easy for adult hands and toddler hands to use.The spoon size is larger than the starter spoons by munchkin, but it's better to feed with, as you can feed with just the tip of the spoon.You will find that a teething baby forever has a wet shirt and these bibs keep baby totally dry.The birpy bibs are reversible, always come clean, are super soft, and we now own 6 to match all outfits!Aden and Anais is phenomenal!I saw these bibs at a local shop and recognized instantly that they were just what I needed for my very messy little eater.As soon as I started feeding my daughter food (6 mo), her little drool bibs were no longer enough to keep her clean.These bibs are different.They're big, worn like a reverse shawl, so they cover shoulders and arms, too.When my baby blows raspberries with a mouthful of carrots, shaking her head from side to side and spraying bright orange spittle like a sprinkler, these bibs have her covered.Stains bleach out in bright sun.They are a phenomenal product and I highly, highly recommend them to anyone with a baby.I deduct one star only for price.As muslin can be bought for less than $3 a yard, it always surprises me that aden+anais products are so expensive.I guess you pay for design and quality, but I'm going to try to make my own rather than buy a second pair.I love all of Aden & Anais products!They are MUST haves for baby.Have been using this as a burping cloth instead of a bib.As a burping cloth, its the perfect size to stay on my shoulder and the material is super soft and is very absorbent.We own the original ones sold from Aden+Anais and we also own ones from Aden+Anais for little77 (American Eagle Outfitters).4 layers of muslin lets nothing through and they are very versatile.I love the snaps as no velcro messes up clothes in the wash.The aden + anais Burpy Bib is an absorbent, kidney-shaped muslin bib/burp cloth.CoosCan be used from infancy unlike other bibs (we love stuff with dual purpose and extended use).Ample coverage as a bib and a burp cloth (fits well on parent's shoulder as a burp cloth and covers baby's shoulders and most of their arms as a bib).Can be used to wipe up messes after eating (plenty of fabric).Two-sided (mess up one side at lunch and use the other other side at dinner).Four layers of soft absorbent muslin (signature of aden + anais products).Simple snap closure for bib use.Cleans well (no noticeable stains after many splashes of baby food and regular washes).Durable (has been pulled, stretched, and chewed).Cute aden + anais patterns.Can be used later to clean up all kinds of spills (yeah!I received a pair of these as a gift and ordered several more sets after seeing how useful they are.They are soft, absorbent, shaped perfectly for the shoulder and they can double as a bib!They also come in a lot of cute designs and match my blankets and sleepsacks that I also have.I rated the aden+anais bib similarly, so forgive me for repeating myself.I love this product.These washclothes are so soft.They are much better than traditional terry washclothes, and WORLDS better than those awful poly-terry washclothes they sell at Target.They also hold a lot of water which you can squeeze out to rinse shampoo out of your baby's hair or suds off of her skin.I have the orange set (Splish Splash) and I think the dots and goldfish are really cute.I'm not as big a fan of the little people print, because I hate stuff that is branded all over with logos, but who cares.I'm going to try to make some more myself.I thought it was silly to buy a special wash cloth for a baby, but I soon learned that adult sized wash cloths are too big for baby's small parts.I have to fold them in half and quarters in order to get a good wash.I love all aden+anais products and I knew these would be great too when I purchased these washcloths.A+A products never disappoint me and they're always made with great quality.I'm taking a star off because the ones with the heavy designs on it are not as soft.As in, the paint used to make the polka dots make the washcloth rough.The fabric itself is soft.This is kind of an issue when I'm wiping my baby's face.If I could do it over again, I would get the cute patternless green edged ones in white.They dampen the noise to make it tolerable, but obviously do not block it out completely.Our friends who have kids have also tried our pair on their little ones and are planning on purchasing the same!Ordered these earmuffs for her.This is the neatest thing.I just got it in the mail and tried it on both my boys about a half hour ago and it works great!Both my kids have colds.I got bunches of stuff out of my 3 year old's nose and there was a little in my 1 year old's nose.It is easy to use and easy to clean.I used it with a facial tissue.It only took 2 days to ship.I'm extremely pleased.Only cons I can think of would be that it is pretty spendy for a plastic egg shaped contraption.But, I suppose the company might have to charge that much to make a living.I see that they aren't getting as much business as nosefrida.And it is comparatively priced to nosefrida.I haven't tried the nosefrida but what made me choose babycomfynose over it is the fact you can just use facial tissues as the filter and tissue is supposed to work better than the filters that the nosefrida uses.Another thing is tissue would be less expensive than nosefrida filters.It seemed like it would be easier to clean.Babycomfynose works way better than those hospital style nasal aspirators.umm wipes down the nose and get them shiny and clean inside lolit is not comparable to the bulb ones.. oh no...your hands dont get tired and you get it done in 15 seconds..my boy loves it.. which is weird lolp.s.it is made by the small company in US so lets support them and not buy chines crap.While initially hesitant to use the BabyComfyNose (seemed more complicated than using tissues), I was a true convert after trying it.It's done the job each and every time when cotton balls or tissues have failed (I don't even bother with the latter anymore).The blue aspirator they give you at the hospital is worthless compared to this thing!Once you get over the weirdness of how this product works, you'll find it works tons better than other products out there.My only advice would be to use just half a Kleenex and make sure it's placed towards the front of the aspirator (the part you put in the nostril).My son just got his first cold at 13 months, so I've never had to deal with a stuffed up kid till now.I will say that this is probably a lot easier to use when they are small.He is not as big a fan as I am...though I will say that you can do this one handed and hold your kid down with the other hand...it's not easy, but it can be done.Sometimes I was more successful than others, unfortunately sometimes his screaming and fighting would just produce more snot and we'd end up back at square one, but I can't fault the Snoover for that.It definitely gets what you're aiming to get!And I love that you just stuff a tissue in it to act as the filter....so easy!She cried & squirmed so much that it looked traumatizing for her... Also, you have to suck REALLY HARD & LONG in order for it to do any good!Maybe if the hose wasn't so long, you wouldn't have to suck so hard??I also don't see much benefit to the germ reservior...ahhhh where do I begin.I had such high hopes for this one.Instead of this stroller, get the bumbleride twin if you can afford it (it's totally thin enough, don't worry :), or the joovy ergo (if you have a child willing to sit/stand).Here's my review of the aria twin 2010......- SHADE: the canopies look useless in the photo but they're actually nice & come all the way down to the tray.Kids don't like that.my kids duck their heads forward to the outside of the shade (does this make sense?like, the kids' faces are forward overtop of the tray b/c if they sat back the shade would be right in front of their faces.so I guess in that way the shade is useless.Oh, and the kids' legs are exposed.- TRAY: the trays are easily removed and put back - just a button (not the same as the pliko p3 but similar).But there's a downside... (and this is a big but) ...The tray for the "40" seat is 1 inch wide.it's ~10 inches long and approximately 1 inch wide.so if you line up 10 triscuits, that's the width and length of the indentation in the tray.I'm not kidding or exxagerating.do you think the older kid will let the younger kid put his cup on their tray?let me answer that for you.so the trays are there which is a plus, but the design is the worst I've seen.- SEATS:  seats are straight up & down which I LOVE.My kids don't like it when they can't sit straight up & down.(they do recline.they also fit big kids.nope.it's fairly good steering & turning fully loaded but you still have to use 2 hands....and it has that catch up where the front wheels point in one direction and you want to go in the other direction, you have to reverse it & then push it forward.I had test driven the 2009 version & it pulled to one side horribly (whichever side had the heavier kid).you can totally tell you're pushing a flimsy plastic stroller,  (the frame is made of flimsy plastic, unlike the bob strollers or bumbleride or joovy ergo)- COLORS:  the one that looks beautiful blue and brown is not.it is this ugly gray stripe material and brown.it is very ugly.I mean very very ugly.it would've been pretty with blue & brown but they went with gray and brown which I wouldn't wear together if I were picking out clothes.and the gray is gray stripes.not condusive to peace.- DOORWAYS:  it fits through a door but I definitely would not take this thing to the mall & expect to get around clothing racks.You'd be pushing and pulling the thing trying to get it to turn & it wouldn't fit anyway.- STORAGE:  looks good - I think I could actually fit some stuff down there.I could easily and comfortably fit 2  filled paper grocery bags down there to give you an idea.storage is a plus.- HARNESS:  they kept the harness design where the 5 point part of it is not secure.I don't know how to explain this properly - just think of it like this - there is only a 3 point harness.this stroller does not have a 5 point harness  (it does but the top of the 5 point harness is not attached to anything so it's worthless.which is neither bad or good, it's just an observation.(actually it's only bad if you were hoping for a 5 point harness.- FOLDING & UNFOLDING: easy to do- WEIGHT & MATERIAL: you can lift it with one hand.very nice weight!......oh, but the downside!when you turn this stroller, the whole thing is made of plastic so you can feel the entire frame torque.simply by turning a corner.the frame twists & I'm just waiting for it to snap.It won't but it feels like it will.I don't think this stroller would last long with my use.anyhow, that's my review.here's my take on other strollers:- gracos?kids are reclined & no trays & storage is hard to get to  (their trays are so poorly designed they are not worth buying)  I have the bob revolution ($450 incl.accessories, great but only takes 1 kid & no useful cup holder (I bought the cup holder & it's worthless & the seats don't sit straight up)- jane powertwin?great for kids under 1 year old but the seats still have to be removed to fold it- baby jogger same problem as bob - kids are reclined  (& they don't  have good trays)- kolcraft tandem?super super heavy & you have to take the seats off (difficult) every time you fold it- peg perego pliko p3 ($350, still use it but hard to steer),- joovy caboose triple stroller ($400, too big for our suv - have to disassemble it for it to fit)my 2 favorites are the joovy ergo sit & stand (i wrote a review on that one on amazon) & my favorite  (which is the most perfect stroller I've ever tried & the only one I"ll ever need) is the ridiculously expensive bumbleride twin (I wrote a review for that one too).So it's a good stroller.I really can't believe it cost that much for a piece of flimsy plastic!It's very light weight and can stand alone without being propped up.The basket is larger than others, however will not fit a diaper bag.I have to but things in a different type of bag to fit into he basket.It is large and fold down more that what the picture shows to cover better.I can't believe they didn't show are far down the canopy goes.It fit through doors at the amusement park, not at the house.I don't know how long it will last.So if this is your price range, I say get it!Because of it's light weight I'll go 4 stars.For such a lightweight stroller it handles well.This is our mall and errand stroller.It also needed to fit one car seat.It negotiates very well for a double stroller.Due to it's light weight and non huge inflated tires we'll probably relegate this to pavement.The Bumbleride is awesome, however my wife has a hard time picking that up and putting it in the SUV (weighs 34lbs), thus the need for a lightweight stroller.Why we didn't go 5 stars:-Not super easy to snap in the car seat.Our 8 week gets jostled around when we snap this in.-Cup holders not so great for kids or parents.-Peg Perego customer service doesn't reply to our emails.You have to call them.They are virtually invisible behind the unit and the screws provided were high quality [not stripping].I wanted to avoid having to buy even more bras after I had my baby, so when I saw this item I knew I wanted to try it.I have also found that I can even leave it on and reattach my nursing bra, which will really come in handy for me when I return to work.I can't say enough good things about this product!I pump at work every day and was frustrated by being unable to even answer the phone while pumping.This has solved my problems!!It is made out of nice quality material that feels like swimsuit material, and makes life so much easier.It's stretchy and fits well and my pump fits in easily.The color (red polka dots) makes it somewhat cute, even though I'm the only one who will ever see it.What a great product for any mother using an electric double pump!I didn't want to invest in yet another nursing bra or other lingerie to enable hands-free pumping, so when I came across this product on Amazon I was delighted.Best of all, it goes right over my existing nursing bra.The PumpEase holds the breast flanges snugly and there are no leaks.I've already recommended this to my other mommy friends.I saw this and similar products on Amazon and told myself I'd get it but with a new baby you have so many other essentials that I put it off for a month and a half.Now that I have it if I occasionally forget it I can't remember what I did without it.The ability to pump hands free is phenomenal and now that I'm back to work abd pumping more often I can't imagine not having this.One added benefit is that it covers your breasts so if by any chance you get walked in on - never happened to me but pumping at work makes me worry about this - no one can see your breasts.I love that!I got the tuxedo in Med, I wear a size high C or low D and ut fits well, not snug and not loose.I do wonder if I should have gotten the small sometimes for a tighter for.I gave them a 4 because they are a bit expensive and because unlike some of the other brands you cannot wash and reuse them.They are softer than other brands and they can stretch.This is a large arm that appears to be very sturdy and well made.The end of the arm where the mobile attaches has a closed loop.Our other mobile arm has a hook.If your mobile has a hook, this is the arm for you.If your Mobile has a closed loop as ours does, this arm is useless.We returned ours.More my fault than anything, but the molding on the edge of our crib didn't work with this clamp.I had a hard time finding one that did!These are cute and soft and bigger than I expected them to be.Nice alternative to sucking the water out of the washcloth while we're trying to scrub!they are soft so she can chew on them and also they squirt.It sucks for the purpose its supposed to have.the whole cup squishes up so its just flat.Its fine for rinsing the body but for keeping water out of the eyes its horrible.Such a waste of money.I have been using this the past few months with my newborn, who is now 3.5 months.I ended up getting a green color.It is very flexible and wider at the perpendicular (to the handle), but not so much that it covers her forhead (she is 20 months).I read the other review and agree it's not flying across the water - but it is durable.Since 18mo - our now 2 year old has enjoyed pulling the string, putting it in the tub as well as watching the yellow wheel on the bottom spin.My hubbie also discovered that he LOVES it when you put in on the side of the tub and it hops around.This toy is super cute but it barely moves in the water.I had thought it would ZOOM!But this is not the case.they are easy to keep clean and she plays with them out of the tub as well.I just think they're so darn cute, even though I can't figure out for the life of me what the green one is supposed to be.Maybe a sea anenome?All these bath toys need to be diposed often since you can't cleaned them well.He has used them in his baby tub, in our pool, and is now using them in the big tub.These squirt toys are very well-made and met my expectations 100%.The rubber material is soft and appear to be durable.My 4 year-old daughter loves playing with these during bath time.He cant really squeeze water out of them, but I do it after each bath.Its soft and easy to clean.Great bath toy.Considering most tubs have the little knob on the spout to switch from tub to shower, you'd think all spout covers would be designed to accommodate that.Didn't fit.I bought this at a store and by the time I tried it out, it was too late to return it.So I gave it to a friend who could actually use it.Good idea and cute frog, but the fit is not adjustable and if you have a thin faucet this will just fall right off.This spout cover is cute and definitely covers the spout well.It's a little hard to get over the spout, but very easy to remove.I think the price is right too!The bowl is the best I've found for feeding, fits in the palm of your hand so well.And the surprise I was not expecting is that the spoon is awesome too!Its like a jelly rubber so its super soft on her mouth.What really makes this a great bowl is the ergonomic design, where my left thumb easily slides into the handle, and the bowl rests on my palm stably and comfortably.I'm ordering more of these spoons, as one just isn't enough!We're doing baby led weaning & needed a spoon my 6 month old could use herself (we preload it).This is great because it's easy for her to hold, soft for when she bites on it, & the guard prevents her from putting it too far in.I have more than a few different toddler spoons in my cupboard--including theSassy Baby Less Mess Toddler Spoon, theNUK Gerber BPA Free Graduates Scoopin Spoon, and theNUK Gerber Graduates Soft Bite Spoon For Toddler--and the Sassy spoon is the one that he has the best results with!I highly recommend trying this spoon!We love this spoon!I also have to make sure I grab a regular baby spoon and this one as well.They are not feeding themselves yet but they insist on grabbing for the spoon so after I have given them the bulk of their food I let them try with this, loading the spoon for them and handing it to them.I have also found it useful for teething.I started putting it on their exercauser and they will stand in it and chew on this spoon for the longest time until they drop it or I take it.It is a soft, flexible material although from the picture it kind of looks like a harder plastic.I love that it is BPA free and I love the price.We will probably end up getting atleast one more of these.But the little holes that help the food stay on the spoon are hard to clean out.We use the boon spoon now.My 7 month old has started to grab the spoon as I'm trying to feed her so I decided to buy this for her to experiment with.She's not ready to feed herself yet but since she's having so much fun just playing with this spoon, maybe the actual self-feeding process will go smoothly too.The other day I was completely unable to snap one of them on, and ended up putting it in the fridge without a complete seal.very annoying.The other two bowls I could get the lids on, but with the inflexibility it is just very odd, they snap on all at once with a loud pop.The bowls can still be used for feeding.The main function I purchased them for, however, was the suction feature.The only thing I do not like is the lids do not stay on and if the baby food is to thin it will leak through the bottom.Also if it is to thick it won't fit through the nipple.One of my sons has brain damage and has issues eating off a spoon.I would buy again and again!The smell of plastic was so strong on this item that I threw it in the garbage.It comes with a removable tray that fits in the dishwasher.We looked at many other highchairs and some were much more expensive but this one met our needs much better.It not only is a highchair but also a removable booster chair that we can attach to our own dining chairs when she is older.Our dining table is counter height so the booster chair feature will come in handy when we want our baby to be at our level.(The highest the highchair goes is still not tall enough for our counter-height table.)I bought this stroller to go with the matching car seat.The car seat goes into and comes out very easily.We bought this stroller together with a car seat.We are on a tight budget and this was the cheapest yet safest option for us.I like the stroller.It's easy to maneuver and not to heavy.I am so glad I got this...I should have earlier.My daughter loves it and wants to sit in it all the time.She hates her other "travel" high chair that converts into a booster seat.I guess she just out grew it.This seat is easy to clean too.The very back of the booster sits 12" back without the seat back/harness in use.This booster will not scratch your chairs as it has cushioned feet and attaches to your chair from both the back and bottom so it can be tightened well.It will give your toddler/pre-shooler an approximately 3" boost up to the table(something to keep in mind when factoring chair height to table height, leaving enough room for your child's legs in between).Last, all three straps can be thrown in the wash and the click-in seat back can be easily removed for cleaning.Plus, its quite affordable.Love it!Update April 2011:  We have been so satisfied with this booster that we purchased another for our second child, who is now 15 months old.I love how much easier it is to clean than a high chair.I appreciate that the center crotch strap runs under the child and connects to the back of the seat so that there isn't a hole for food to fall into right between the childs thighs, which would be the case if the crotch strap came straight up from the seat bottom.My son loves his new booster seat because he can sit in a chair at the table with us rather than in a high chair.Plus, now he can really reach (which mommy had to quickly adjust to as he grabbed at things LOL!).This seat is decent looking and at a really appropriate height.Although it seems like one of the settings wouldn't really ever be that useful.My son leans, tries to jump out, etc.and that thing didn't move.I guess if he rocked enough the chair could fall over, but the seat is not going to fall off which is important to safety.There are no shoulder straps.This is something to keep in mind, but it still seems really secure.Although it isn't as hard as it seems when the child is in there because of the sculpting.It is easy to clean too.Overall, this is worth the price and I am very satisfied.I would recommend this sucking pads.The picture is a little different from the product as my sucking pads came with 3 snaps instead of velcro.These sheets are as nice as I've ever seen for a crib.The bumper and dust ruffle really dress up a nursery.The entire set takes seconds to set up.However, the blanket/heavier sheet is too small to fit the rest of of the sheeting, and in such a pricey set one would expect a comforter or at least a snuggly blanket.The fitted sheet fits, the bumper fits and laces nicely, and the crib skirt hangs perfectly in every corner.I was happy that everything fit and worked as described.It is not loaded with prints of animals or cartoon characters but offers a simple white with accents of pink... it sort of reminds me of the look of fresh cotton trimmed in pink.Admittedly this is not the look that all parents are looking for but it does offer a distinguished look.A few observations-- The quilt is most disappointing (and and the reason for removing two full stars) - while it is quilted it is quite thin.In use it acts more like a light throw and not a high quality quilt.I say "oddly" because this crib set is expensive and we expected a quilt that would justify the price.The Pinzon quilt is basically two thin sheets filled with a light polyester filling.- The sheets are brown and pink polka dots - they have a nice feel.So far there has not been an issue with the sheets balling - but if that changes I will update the review.- The bumper - is very high quality - again it is very understated look as it issolid white with pink trimming.It is hard to say if it better or worse than any other skirt.Final Verdict - While we really like the sheet, skirt, and bumper we are pretty disappointed in the quilt.This set consists of a crib sheet, dust ruffle, small comforter, and a bumper set.When described as having hotel stitching, this is true.The stitching is tight enough to stay in place , but not so taut to snap.I had never seen one like this before, but it is not too fussy.Angelic!So tasteful is this set, that your infant's photos will not seem hopelessly dated ten (or even twenty) years from now.That really depends.I would rather invest a tad more in this product than pay a little less for one that offended my sensibilities (or compromised my standards).My vote?If you are "on-the-fence" here, delete a few of the toys you have in your cart to compensate for the price-difference.The color is understated so except for the fitted sheet which has some pink polka dots, the other items in the set are neutral enough for either a girl or boy.However, I had some minor quibbles w/ the set.The set is made up of 4 pieces: Bumper, comforter, bed skirt, and fitted sheet.For the price of the product, it seems a bit over priced for the regular person in this type of economy.The fabric feels great, but the bumper is thinner than what I would like.Overall, it's difficult to recommend such a pricey item.But if price is not an issue, and you enjoy the understated look for a baby crib, then this product will work great for you.I was pleased to find the Pinzon Baby 200-Thread-Count 100% Percale Cotton Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Alligator, which matches the blue/white set we have.The quality of the bedding is nice and soft and has held up well over the past two months.(As a side note, I have generally been pleased with Amazon Pinzon products, and this one is no different.)The style is clean and slightly retro with pink and mocha polka dots.The 200 thread count cotton percale is soft and gets softer with repeated washings but doesn't lose its shape.The stitching is all still intact, and the fabric still just gets softer, not thinner or threadbare, even though it gets washed frequently.Second Update:  This crib set lasted the whole time my little baby friend slept in her crib - no pulled threads, no fading, no falling apart.I can't wait to use it!I'm a first time mom-to-be and this bag seems to be practical but we'll see once I actually start using it.The lower canvas portion of the bag is black and white (on the website it looks navy to me).I plan to use it messenger style as apposed to purse style.But, in general the bag is a little stiff, so it may just need some breaking in.I purchased this seat after watching the safety video on the manufacturers website.I do admit that we installed wrong the first time and my son definitely let me know by crying cause he was basically sitting completely vertical.In my car it's installed with anchors and I feel that it was easy and secure.I have a 30 pound 9 month old so I was looking for a rear facing car seat with a high weight limit.After doing hours of research I narrowed it down to the Graco MyRide 65, The First Years True Fit, and the Safety 1st Complete Air but decided on the Safety 1st Complete Air primarily because the rear-facing weight limit is 40 pounds and after reading other reviews that the seat stood up well in accidents.I have a 2005 Nissan Pathfinder and the only way this car seat fits in there rear facing is in the middle back seat (where I wanted it anyways) and with both front seats scooted up slightly more than preferable (they probably should be scooted up a little more to make the level to ground line 100% horizontal--it's 95% there now--but I do need to be able to drive without being totally squished (I am 5'7" and 120 pounds, not a huge person).It took me about an hour to install it but that is with reading the manual and watching the online video.***10SEP10 EDIT***After driving around with this seat for a few days I have decided I am going to return it.My daughter cries every time I put her in it (never had any issues with her old seat) and pretty much every other time I take her in or get her out, the straps get twisted/tangled.***25SEP10 EDIT***I got the Britax Advocate 70 CS.This seat, although initially looks way bigger than the Air Complete, fits MUCH better in our Pathfinder (still in the rear-facing position).I can get the seat in much tighter much more easily due to there being strap tighteners on both sides.It is heavy--21 pounds, and I anticipate that when I turn it around to forward-facing it will squish but still accomodate mid-sized passengers on either side.Disclaimer (about me): I got this seat largely because I drive a Mini Cooper Clubman.The Mini has only two back seats so it is impossible to put a car seat in the center seat for added side impact protection.Thus, some of the inconvenience I mention is an interaction of the seat with my car.That is why I got it and that is why I will keep it,2) The back strap height adjustment is beautiful -- the best I have seen (better than my wife's Graco and as good as any of the others I have played with in the store).3) The padding seems comfortable4) Quality is good (no issues to report)5) The mounting (latch system) works well and is convenient6) The fabric seems to breathe well7) Adjustable lower buckle positionMinuses-------1) The air pockets block access to the seat making it very difficult to snake my daughter around them to get her into the car.I dream about turning the seat around so that I can get her in and out better.2) The other latches (the ones that hold the baby in the seat as opposed to the ones that hold the seat in the car) are hard to work.I have pinched my fingers in the chest clip more than once.The lower buckle is hard to get closed and harder to open.Last night we were in Babies 'R Us and I spent a few minutes opening and closing the chest clips on the Britax seats wondering if the straps were interchangeable....  By the way, I tried from the front -- they are easier to open when facing the seat than when reaching over it.3) The manual is annoying (accurate, but annoying -- everything is divided and listed by procedure not indexed by page and the procedures read like a tax form).4) The reclining feature is lacking.The manual says to adjust it so it is level, the unanswered question is: how?Bottom line-----------My car is the secondary vehicle for baby transport: if the family goes out together, we take my wife's (four door, three seat back seat) Honda CRV.I only put our daughter in my car a couple of time per week (maybe three on average).If this were the primary car seat, I would not keep it, it is simply too difficult to get a baby in and out without bumping her head.As it is, I figure I can manage the 50 to 100 uses left before I can turn it around.I used this stroller with both of my girls before they could sit up in a normal stroller.Things that I love about it:- When running errands, you can just pop your baby's infant car seat in this.It holds the car seat tightly.There are straps that you can snap to secure it further, but I have not had problems with security and I don't tend to use the straps unless I know the terrain will be bumpy.I use this for quick jump in and out of the car trips.The bottom basket is roomy and I have gone grocery shopping just shoving stuff in the basket instead of using a shopping cart.Right now it is my primary stroller - I have a jogging stroller for rough terrain or walking trips.My very heavy diaper (at least a few pounds) bag sits just fine on the handles and doesn't tip over even without the carseat.I have a Skip Hop bag and use the clasps.Durable - its lasted with heavy use for 6 months now and still going strong.It is lightweight.I am very petite and have no problems throwing this around.It fits fine in trunk of my Prius but it does take up room in the trunk.I can still pull the cover over it though just fine.I wouldn't call it an one hand fold, but it folds up easily.You have to hold one button in and press another to get it to fold up, but that's ok as its quick to do once you get the hang of it.I love this stroller and it was well worth the money!I live in a country where the weather is usually hot and I believe this is just the right type of material for summer, hot humid weather.The baby will not get too hot when swaddled.The material is soft and you can see your hand shadow thru the material.Very breathable.It's also very big!I have washed it once and so far it still looks new.It is his new fav and I like that he is getting some tooth brushing in also.I had no idea that my daughter would take to this teether like she did.She will dig through her toy box for this teether and she can hold it easily.I am anxious to take him to the dentist, and want to make sure I set him up for good dental hygiene as I am constantly plagued with teeth problems.I feel this is a great supplementary brusher and teether to the rest of the routine and would highly recommend this for the early teether that hates other's catering to his needs.I love this sheet for our graco pack 'n play.I ordered the Ecru one and it is pictured with animals on it.Beware that it comes in plain Ecru!!I even have to put a wedge under it because my baby has refulx.This sheet helps make the thin mattress much more cushioned.Super soft, washed well, and a great deal (compared to the prices at Babies R Us)!It's alos a lot thicker than the other sheets I bought for my playard - almost a quilt-like thickness.They are indeed softer than the Graco brand sheets.I read someone here said they fit Graco playyards but they do not fit mine.You can get them on but it is so small that they cause the play yard mat to bunch up together and create a bump under the sheet.I bought these based on previous reviews of these and other products similar.They are very softI love this sheet.Velour is very soft and pretty.Do they make crib sheets like this?I absolutely love these fitted sheets.They are both very soft and are made of good material, feels like they can last a long time.I did think per the picture that it was like regular mattress pads and had elastic so it fit like a fitted sheet.It is a flat pad that slides around a little as you put your fitted sheet over it.It will serve it's purpose though and wasn't expensive.I put this under the fitted sheet for the  Graco Travel Lite Crib  and it works like a charm.I also put these on the floor after a bath, when I'm putting on lotion and dressing the baby.These are just so handy and keep anything underneath completely dry.I've washed these many, many times in my HE front load washer and dryer and they hold up great.They save me from washing sheets and changing pad covers on a daily basis.I use different ones for the crib.I got these from my registry, pre-washed them and the middle section bunched up horribly which will considerably affect their absorbansy.They are nothing more than a cheap prefold cloth diaper with a flannel binding added.Starting with prefolds and snappis, these are so much more absorbent and convenient to put on baby.We can go longer between changes and fewer parts/no folding is easier for dad and babysitter to manage.Paired with a great cover, these are the first diapers I go for whenever we're at home.I cannot tell you how many times I've used this spray on my daughter in mothers groups and other moms say "wow, what is that fabulous smell?"Also, a little goes a really long way.You don't have to use the whole tablespoon with the witch hazel -- I've used as little as a teaspoon per 4 ounce bottle and it works great.This is an all around great product -- and you know it's natural.Every mother who tries mine buys her own and raves about it.P.S.Really freshens things up after a poopy diaper!I've used with disposables and bumgenius.My son is very acidic, just like Daddy, so when he gets sick or gets a rash, his poor bum gets stripped and so red.I've tried everything I can, including going to back to disposable diapers to see if it would help, but it didn't.The smell is delightful and I can imagine this is a great product even for mommies who have just given birth (if you know what I mean).Even my husband says it makes cloth diaper changes (the poopy ones) much easier.Also, has a nice flowery smell.I usually use water in a spray bottle and a wipe cloth to clean the baby bottom.But when it comes to cleaning the big job, water doesn't cut it.This product helps to wipe it all clean with one stroke!The mist is very fine, so one push goes on to a large surface evenly and no drips.I mix this with mostly water (I use less potion than the bottle says) and I make a solution with it in a bowl, then dip my flannel wipes in the solution, fold them into quarters, and put them in a wipes warmer.I do not add to Witch Hazel as the bottle says- just water- and it is pleasant and does the job.I recommend this product to anyone doing cloth diapering and wiping.rash on your precious baby's bottom.Per the instructions, we mix the concentrate with witch hazel in a spray bottle, and use it pre-wipe to help slicken sticky messes, and post-wipe as a refreshing spritz to keep redness at bay.My favorite part is being able to mix it up myself to save money.At ten months, we are working through our third bottle and haven't had a bad rash to date!Thank you Kissaluvs for such a great product!I love using this on my baby instead of disposable wipes and their questionable ingredients.Thin and rough material...not high quality at all.Very unhappy with this purchase.The terry side really grabs onto messes and sweeps them away.I can clean the same mess in one wipe what my flannel wipes would take 2-3 wipes to clean up.They curl a little when you first get them, but they flatten out nicely after a month or so.After 3 years of near daily use, our last batch did get thin and start wearing holes through, but 3 years is a long time and so I think that's a fine life cycle for something that's washed so frequently.I still have about 80% of the first batch in rotation, so that's not bad!the only problem is one side seems unfinished, but it's still useful.i use these as washcloths, tooThese wipes are very thick, which is good for cleaning off big poopy messes.However, they are too thick to get into little crevices, especially when you fold them.Folded twice, they are almost half an inch thick!The combination of these dual-sided cloth wipes and warm water beats cold packaged wipes any day to clean little bums -- the looped "terry" side to clean up a large mess and then the smoother reverse side to do the final wipedown.It's definitely not a diaper rash and not an allergic reaction to the detergent being used for her cloth diapers because it's only in one part of her little heiny.And these are not 100% cotton, they're a polyester blend.Basically, they're cheap because they're cheap fabric.You get what you pay for.Kissaluvs' contours are super absorbent, less bulky than prefolds, and dry relatively quickly for the amount of liquid that they hold.When paired with the right cover, I don't even have to pin these and never worry about leaks.But, now that my little one is 13 months, she can soak through one of these in a few hours.I like these for younger babies, but they don't hold much for toddlers.They have stayed very soft and absorb the pee fairly well.These inserts distribute the wet so evenly and are so thin you can hardly tell they've been added to the diaper.We use them with one hemp insert and we have not had any leaks with that combo yet after about a month and a half and our little guy is defined as a heavy wetter.I really love this wet bag.I often use it just to carry wipes, a few dipes, my wallet and phone.It has basically become my "poop purse".It contains odors and wetness well.The snap handle is convenient for attaching to stroller handles or shopping carts.It holds a good amount of used and new diapers at the same time.I usually pack about 5-6 dipes in the dry section, plus wipes and my wallet.I recently stayed away from home for 2 nights and used this.It held all the dipes I had used in 3 days, but I use AI2s so that saves space.And its cute too.Can not believe I even tried cloth diapering with out this!This bag has totally made CD a do-able thing for me.No smell, no wet, no problem.I have washed and dried this many times and always comes out looking good.Thinking about buying a hanging door one, thats how much I like it.Its a great bag but too small!This basically fits into a diaper bag.Not worth the money.My hubby and I use this as a diaper bag that we can pop into whatever bag we are carrying.We use cloth at home which is why we got this, but found it to be too cumbersome when we are out.So we use Nature Babycare biodegradable disposables when we are out instead.We keep a kushies changing pad in it as well as extra diapers, then use the wet side for soiled clothes and diapers when we can't find a trash can.I have been using this stroller for about a month now.I love that I can use just the metal frame and not damage the stroller seat when using the car seat.- Great huge basket that can be accessed from front or back, even when seat is reclined.- Extendable handle for mommy and daddy.- Huge extendable sunshade- Seat converts to bassinet-style without extra pieces to store.- Forward and rear facing seat that easily attaches/detaches.- Features and looks like the pricier strollers for much less!Cons:- Bulky - we can fit nothing else in our Civic trunk.- Tires don't seem to be holding up as well as I might like (but time will tell).- Would like a simpler fold, but it isn't too bad.He is a stomach sleeper and used to spit up often.They are super, super soft, even after washed several times.They are a nice size covering a good area.Now, I use all of the other brands I have under his diaper area.Very nice, good quality and nice color- however, there was only one sheet saver in the package- NOT two.The could cover baby's head or bottom, but not both.I have never used a sheet saver before either, so maybe this is a typical size- not sure.I am all about being prepared for spit-ups and blowouts!So I have multiple layers on our crib so i don't have to sheet change everytime.I have washed mine and hung dried them and they still feel very plush.WE love this cart cover.it really protects your child from all the dirty parts of the car and provides a good cushion as well as restraint.She tends to scoot around her crib on her back until she hits the slats and then either cries or i find her face buried in the bumpers.The Wonder Bumpers are very soft and exactly as pictured.My daughter usually sleeps 8-10 hours a night and wakes up a little sweaty but this morning I had to wake her up after 11 hours and she was dry, sleeping peacefully and not sweaty at all.The only reason I gave this 4/5 stars is because it is not as easy as I thought to put these on.I had to force over half of the zippers into place so I could lock them together to zip them closed.Also, some of the zippers start about half an inch down the material but only on one side, so they end up looking uneven when zipped; but I just made sure those were on the slats up against the wall.Overall a very good product, even if it is quite expensive.Each bumper arrives flat.One side pink; one side brown.For example, I can use the pink sides for a girl or the brown sides for a boy (or I could squeeze out another hundred bucks for a set of blue bumpers, which I'd rather not do.)The crib I have has rails that are longer than two feet.So the solution is to put the zipper to the side, and hope that the kid doesn't spin the bumper around.It's great that the bumpers are machine washable.Actually, removing it is not so bad, but putting them back is a bit of a chore.(Which, I know, is essentially what it is,) but for the price, you almost hope that it would be a little better sewn, without fabric twisting to one side, or having an exposed zipper, or having loose visible threads.Again, it's a minor nitpicking issue right now, because as soon as I snipped the threads and placed the bumpers on the crib, all I could think of was, 'Gee, I wish I had purchased this set first and not wasted my money on the traditional bumpers I got.'8/31/2011 Update: I recently bought eight more individual bumpers (four packs of 2 bumpers each) and noticed that the foam insert is now covered with a thin mesh case of its own.It's a much better presentation than the original bumpers I had.this is the only product on the market that keeps my baby from banging her head on the rails and getting hurt when going to sleep and also in the night.super soft and durable with the added benefit that they stop the pacifiers from falling out!We've been having hellish summer weather so I wanted something more insulating than the normal insulated cups.When he does decide to drink out of it, he does it just fine...except that 1) the lid seems to be somewhat in his face and he doesn't like that and 2) he doesn't know enough yet to snap it shut, so when he lays it down or drops it, we're left with a big wet spot.(It took a milk-soaked car seat cover before realizing it fully.Yuck, I know.)I also wish these came in colors other than pink or blue, as I like to buy baby stuff in neutral colors.It doesn't feel heavy and I don't regret my choice as of yet.I consider it a great price for the type of stroller that it is.I am currently trying to find something just for when I'm in NYC.This stroller doesn't fit well in small stores, I can't take it with me to the baby's DR.'s office.It won't even fit through the entrance door for my mother's apartment.I made the mistake of taking a public bus with it and it was horrible.You need both hands to close it and it's just way too big for NYC.I expected these to be a rubber-type material so as to help my hurting nipples- to keep my bra from putting pressure on my sensitive nipples.Instead, they are hard plastic and put too much pressure on my breasts.The basic design is good (shape, size, fact that they catch leakage,etc) but the hard plastic is no good!We live in downtown Chicago and do not own a car.We usually use public transportation but, occasionally it's easier to take a cab (e.g.when going to the airport with all the luggage).I have looked EVERYWHERE for a "portable" car seat.Sunshine kids was just too heavy and did not fold small enough and our Safety 1st Tote n' Go (a backboard with a 5 point harness) was difficult to install, our son sat on an angle even when installed properly and overall it did not seem safe.I read the all the reviews I could find and called Safety 1st for more information on installation.The 9lb does not feel like 9lb - far less weight than a Graco infant seat.I'm 5'3" and it's easier to carry than my diaper bag over my shoulder.I usually take my Maclaren Quest when we use public transportation or a cab and I am able to hang the bag/booster on my Maclaren handlebars without it getting in the way of walking.I read the instruction booklet front to back before our first trip in a cab.WOW!It really does install quickly - try 60 seconds or less!The main reason it is such an easy install is because the seat back is soft and folded down when you are installing the seat - you have more visibility to what you are doing and accessibility to the seat belt.I also feel this car seat is definitely safe enough to use when we travel and rent a car.The only thing I wish this product had is backpack straps on the bag but, it's a minor gripe.The child sits very upright and will have no place to sleep - I'd purchase another 5 point harness booster or car seat if I owned a car.I bought this for a friend as a gift because I LOVE mine.The fabric is a looseweave, BREATHABLE cotton with cute prints.Now that he is 4 months I don't swaddle him so much anymore but I throw one over my shoulder and use it as a burp cloth and wrap him at the same time.And because they are light weight they are easy to throw in a diaper bag and not take up too much room.I've also used them to cover the carseat when I take it out when he is sleeping and as a nursing cover.I also tie a knot in one corner and let him chew on this since he is teething.I've also used them as crib liners and we always have a couple lying around the house, for him to cuddle up with.We are looking forward to wearing them out.They have thin but strong material that doesn't overheat our baby.Cute designs, but the big seller is the size, quality material and you can use them for so much more than just swaddling.So versatile (great for breastfeeding discreetly, throwing over the stroller on those too sunny days or nap time, swaddling, and great for summer babies).I know some people don't like that they stretch, but think of it as growing with your baby.we used them from the 2nd day in the hospital.i use them as blankets, swaddle wrap, burp cloth, to cover the car seat from the sun or mosquitoes.i will be buying them for all my pregnant friends!i do wish they were a tad bit bigger.It's thin enough to swaddle a baby in summer.I wanted to order the bigger one and when I received it, it was smaller.It still works but I like the bigger one better.I think the bigger one is 47x47.Even though this one is smaller, I'm still able to swaddle my 5 month old (soon to be 6 month) baby.She takes a little more time to finish her bottle on which she didnt complained at all and the best of all...there's no spill or leak !!Definitly will buy more !This is a wonderful product!It goes great with a clip on chair.I only wish there were a few more styles and materials.I bought two of these, one in pink and one in green.My daughter really likes having a place mat and I like having one that catches food before hitting her clothes or the floor.In restaurants, people routinely come up to me and ask what it is, what it's called, and where I got it.It minimizes food on the floor, keeps my daughter's mouth, hands and food off of the tables, suctions onto most surfaces, folds up when dirty so the mess is self-contained, and we can use clips to tether toys to it and keep them off the floor.The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it has gotten discolored- particularly by tomato sauce.So even though it's clean, it looks kind of brown and dirty (we have the blue).Wish they darker colors or patterns to mask this.This place-mat is good in theory.Unfortunately, like most toddlers he seeks out challenges, and is able rip the entire mat of the table within seconds now.He thinks it's a game and laughs every time.With that said, at least it does a good job at staying put.Another downside is that this mat is a little on the bulky side.Definitely not something you can just keep in your diaper bag.I keep mine stashed in my car for when we eat out.Not a perfect product, but glad I have it!It lives in our diaper bag.It is made of durable, flexible rubber and cleans up very easily with a wet wipe.It will occasionally stain but the stains have all eventually washed out (without any intense scrubbing or harsh chemicals).Either way, we didn't buy it because it was pretty.My husband and I have both worked in restaurants.The bus boys usually use the same rag to wipe up tables all night long.I did NOT want my kid eating off that.I will admit it sticks to some surfaces better than others.The cleaning agents used on the table seem to play a part in how well the suction cups adhere.I would saw it sticks well 80% of the time.We use it 100% of the time.Our little guy is used to it so he doesn't bother trying to pull it up if it is not stuck down.We take this around in our diaper bag and use when we eat out, or even at our home kitchen table.It's best for letting baby self-feed.What a waste of money!We used them for the first time on Friday.First of all, the suction cups did NOT stay securely in place no matter how firmly we pressed them down.Our boys didn't really mess with them at first but halfway through the meal, one of them easily pulled the whole placemat off the table and all the food on the placemat and in the little "trough" went flying!Great idea in theory; I wish they actually worked!I gave this two stars instead of one because it *might* work better for a younger baby (6-9 months or so).I purchased two of these at the recommendation of a friend, almost 3 years ago for my 1st child and now use them for my second child too.I didn't have to worry about her (like all kids, licking, biting or as kids always end up doing) eating food off the dirty table tops!So far she hasn't had much success and she's a strong little one!We just attach it to the table, sit her in the high chair and she can feed herself finger foods and I don't have to stress out trying to keep her clean!When she's done eating, I just roll it up, (it's designed to fold into itself and stay that way, until we get home.I wash it, roll it up and it goes back in the diaper bag for the next time.This is also great, because she's always done eating before us, you can roll it up leaving a clean "play" area on the table.I would definitly recommend them!!!When attaching to the table tops, make sure you dampen the suction cups with a little moisture from the outside of your drink glass and it will stay in place even better!Buy this!Very light and my daughter just toss them around.I think the material used is very cheap.I have seen another product that my nephew uses its very sturdy and sticks to the table.I think this is a waste of money.I bought these bottles to try & compare them to the Dr. Brown's and Born Free bottles I was lugging around...in glass.They are a good replacement overall: light weight & extremely tight caps.However, the idea of the "colic reduction" isn't really any benefit in this bottle...my little man has acid reflux....& they will leak on you if you don't have them assembled just right.You will know immediately if they are leaking...they just start spilling out on the counter.Also, they don't fit into my high tech bottle warmer either.The great thing about these bottles that keeps me using them is that you can completely disassemble & reassemble these bottles for optimal cleanliness!I love that I can actually clean these bottles & know that they are indeed...clean.And that keeps me using these bottles along with my Born Free collection.Around seven months old my son was ready to move on from his baby nuk bottles to a bottle that held more liquid and was faster flowing.He loves them, he had no trouble switching from the old bottle.These hold a good amount of liquid.The nipple is silicone, yet as soft as the laytex that he was using.He is the only one in his daycare that has these so thats a plus.They are super easy to clean and I love the fact that the necks are wide.This allows for less mess when preparing bottles.The anti-colic version has twist-off bottom with another 'rubber' valve to allow air in when your baby is sucking food from the nipple.With the product on this page there will be a buildup of negative pressure as your baby sucks on it, so s/he will have to stop eating to let air in occasionally.I see another person commented on the nipple collapsing, which I could see happening since the nipple is rather narrow and too much pressure could cause it to completely close.Even with the anti-colic valve though my son has to stop and let air in through the nipple so I question its effectiveness.I know the product title also says 'colors may vary' and we have a boy so I was hoping the odds were in my favor and we wouldn't get the pink option.Of course we got the 1 out of 3 I wasn't hoping for, but I'm not knocking the product because of this since I knew it beforehand (only 2 stars because the description is totally wrong).We'll just use the pink bottles at home and he can get in touch with his feminine side.Description is totally wrong though.Don't buy this one unless you don't care about getting the anti-colic valve.Mine came in white/blue and I'm glad I didn't end up with pink.I didn't realize till I got it that it comes with 2 different 'nipples'.One is the x-type nipple, and the second is a softer material that looks more like what would be on a sippy cup.I got this mainly for the handles for my 3 1/2 month old that wants to hold his own bottle already.He does better with the smaller bottles so it's a bonus that the handle is removable and I can place it on a smaller bottle for him.My bbay is only 5 months and I have not tried yet the soft spout.I am hoping it would be as good as the original nippleI am an avid MAM user, that is why I chose this training cup.The handles remove easily which is great since she didn't care for them.Otherwise, great product.DONT waste your money1- they are WAY too small for any nursing mom2- they are too stiff and won't sit right in any bra3- they are itchy, rough and uncomfortable4- they don't absorb more than a teaspoon before you need a changeI would give these pads a zero if I could!They're FLAT!These are basically a scratchy jersey circle, with bulky serged seams at the outside.Oh, they're useless.Now, admittedly, even before the girls were "working girls" as they have been for the past six months, I haven't been flat-chested since I was 14, but these are seriously unusable unless you have a completely flat chest (I'm talking, less than an A cup), because there is no darting or seaming whatsoever to make a _cup_ shape, which is required for any sort of protruding breast.As I am forcibly reminded every time I forget them (eep!!Buy these, and you'll be baffled and cursing, as I was (and it's not just the sleep deprivation!I am a 36D and I have been using these for the past 5 months (my daughter is 5 months old).They can absorb a lot of milk before leaking and they have held up thus far with me washing and drying them.They are starting to look a little dirty so I plan to bleach them soon, but otherwise, they are holding up well and I still like them.I have not tried any other brands.Alas, I really am not huge and perhaps because of that they suit me well.All other reusable nursing pads I tried before were so big that they were protruding from the bra.These are simple, but so are other pads I've seen on the market and frankly I don't need a cone design to cover my nipples.They do leak sometimes when there's a bigger let down, but hold up much better than others I've tried, especially the disposable ones which constantly leaked.I throw them into the washer with my baby's items (I don't hand wash) and always have a pair handy to use, they survive a washer and a dryer without any problems.Do you like soaking wet bras?Do you enjoy looking like you've just come from a wet t-shirt contest all the time?If not, then you should just go ahead and buy the disposable Lansinoh pads.I thought that I was doing enough laundry every day to keep up with reusable pads- but I was wrong.These were awful.I recommend that you not waste your money or time and pass on these.it is a good product that gets the job done.When you add water, this bottle warmer quickly heats up the water very quickly to produce steam to heat the bottle and the shuts off when the water has all evaporated.Buyer beware -- lactation consultants at the hospital told us to throw these away.Likewise,Baby 411 Booksays the same thing - do not use these.The reason is the flat nipple.It teaches the baby to bite down hard on the plastic, which will turn mama's nipple looking like that also.I own a bunch of these but plan on tossing them all.Nice concept.It take a while to figure out how to fit two pacifiers in there.Also, the transparent NUK pacifiers are slightly bigger and are even harder to fit.The colored ones are easier to fit.Since I bought only NUK pacifiers and bottle nipples for my newborn I thought to add this cute carrying case to our collection.I've got the orange one and I really like it, it protects from dirt when we're outside and it easily attaches to mom's purse or a diaper bag.I thought these would be a lot bigger,and I was hoping to get the blue one...I got the orange one and it's way smaller than the other one I got for a lot cheaper.This case is very convenient and durable.The only issue i had with it is that soothies will not fit into it.It only works with the regular shaped pacifiers like MAM and NUK, etc.My baby does like this pacifier though I haven't given her any other kind.I'm going to look for other pacifiers that have a flatter base and hope that she'll take those instead.My baby didn't really care for these, but every baby is different.There is no way to get them absolutely clean because moisture gets trapped inside the hollow nipple and you just can't get all of it out.It's pretty disgusting.I totally agree with the previous reviewer.Very frustrating.We have tried many different kinds, including this one, and I truly think this was the worst one for my baby.The nipple is extremely small and confuses him.Overall, this product did not work for us.This is his favorite teether, even above his pacifier.We've purchased two more sets as gifts.So far, so good.He holds it well and doesn't have a problem using the sippy nipple on the bottles.We started giving this sippy to our 4mo daughter and she learned really quick!They are interchangeable with the nuk wide bottles so it was easy for her to transtion!Easy to clean and if you already use the bottles, its easy to just grab a bottle and lid ring, since the sippy handles fit on the bottles too =] I definantly recomend this sippy!But I've gone through ten spouts already, and they all have warped!!We have only been using them for about 3 months.It's so stressful when I'm trying to fix my son something to drink in a rush and it leaks milk all over him!Today they all go in the trash!We are going to stick with nuby for now on.I own more than ten of these cups.-_- What a waste!Maybe I got a defective one...?The coloring of the spout on this started to fade as if the coloring was leaking out or being washed away.I only handwashed this for about a month.It started out blue and now it's almost colorless... Not sure why this is happening but it concerns me that my 7 month old is putting her mouth on a part with coloring that fades...***Update***I reordered another NUK Learner Cup, this time with the silicone spout and I love that the spout is clear and color free!!When he was five months old we tried this sippy cup and it worked wonders.I did snip the hole a little bigger for him and that seemed to be just to his liking.We introduced this bottle several times, along with spoon feeding thinned out cereal before he was finally weaned off breastmilk.The whole process took about 1.5-2 weeks.Oh, we hate the handles but that's easy enough to remove and use without.Not as leakproof as the playtex sippy cups but good enough for supplemental fluids at the dinner table.They warp, turn all sorts of odd shades and leak like crazy, save your money!First of all, to those giving this item a poor rating because they only got one spout or the wrong color, I say READ THE TITLE OF THE ITEM!These sippy cup spouts fit into the regular Nuk wide-mouthed bottles.So without having to buy a whole new cup, I was able to get her used to the idea of a sippy cup early on, and make sure she still gets her 7-8oz.I found with my first child, that the earlier you start, the easier it is for transitions to new things.I  love this learner cup because of its small size, handles and very soft spout, but the problem I have with it is the rubber smell coming from inside the bottle and the spout.This is the second sippy cup I've tried for my 6 month old (the first one is a Nuby and she had a hard time with the spout).The spout is longer than most that I've seen so it is a good transition from a bottle.It's also soft for little gums.I love that the handles spin around from the bottom of the cup so they are always in line with the spout.I've used this cup for several weeks now and have never had a leak.I've carried it around in my diaper bag and it's been dropped repeatedly from the high chair (yeah.. we've started that game) with no problems.She does usually end up with water all over her front when she bites on the spout, but that's going to happen with any cup when they are just learning.This sippy is ok -- it doesn't leak and has easy-to-clean components.I could have just gone to Target and picked out the color if I had known that was the case; I had assumed "assorted colors" meant red, blue, green, etc.Overally, I just don't think this is super special or woth the relatively high pricetag.I think it as good as anything else on the market.It's got a soft spout, which is great.The handles can be removed as the cup fits into the bottom and handles almost like a base.This is also great for getting the spout lined up with the handles.No leakage problems to be had as of yet.We started out with the Nuk sippy cups with the latex spouts and found them to be very leaky, so we gave the silicone a shot, since I could use the old cups and just switch out the spout if I needed to.They were great, all we used, for about 5-6 months and the holes in the spout cracked and ended up with a huge open hole.We switched to the OXO sippy cups (DD wouldn't look at anything without handles) and we love them.I'd say we started using this with water around 8-9 months and used it all the time for milk and water when she turned a year, and they lasted another 3 months after that.Being from Germany I was thrilled to find some "German products" in the States.NUK is a very good brand.I have used NUK for my son 8 years ago and now tried out this cup for my 8ms old daughter.The cup itself is great, handles snap on the bottom and can be left off, if no longer needed.The soft spout is really what sold me on this, since my daughter refuses to drink out of a cup with a hard spout or any other brand cup.The spout really is much softer than any other ones we tried, BUT - it often leaks.I have also noticed that the spout gets suck inwards and also causes the leak.Not sure if others have issues with it..my baby took to it right away.also no leaking!!the only downside is that they do not sell the silicone replacement nipples, (they do sell a latex version replacements) but it is very durable so i don't think it will wear out that soon.just an update, they now sell the silicone replacement nipples for this.I'll be trying to transition my 9 month old from bottles to these cups for milk soon.So far, she likes to drink water out of these.At first, the bottle was a bit heavy but it took about a month for her to get used to the handles.I love this silicone spout better than the latex one I got -- that one for some reason was fading color...The silicone spout works the best for my baby because it's more pliable.It also doesn't leak like others can.Product update: Like many other reviewers, the silicone spout has now torn which now allows the cup to leak.Nuk does not sell replacement spouts (so useless!!).Now that my baby has learned to suck from a sippy cup I'll have to move on to cups with sturdier spouts.Nuk: please start to sell replacement spouts for a decent price (not at a price that's identical to replacing the entire cup)-- Thanks!I've tried several sippy cups and all were wastes of money!I had a lot of trouble trying to find a cup my son would drink formula/milk from.He would drink water or juice from other cups but not milk.There is a review that says that the spout is easy to pull out, but the cup has a ring that screws into the lid and tightens down on the spout and doesn't allow it to come out.I am not able to pull the spout out and neither is my son.The cup is pretty much leak proof, but not totally.If the cup is resting upside down on the spout it doesn't leak.It's really not bad though considering that other cups I've tried with soft spouts leaked from shaking or sitting on the spout.It serves its purpose and it doesn't leak.I'm just annoyed on Amazon that they sent me the wrong color, but I can leave with that.This product, while cute, isn't the best cup out there in my opinion.It's very hard to use because of the removable "cork" sipper that sits inside the top.We purchased these as a 1/2 way bottle between a sippy and his bottle.We had originally tried a brand with the handled affixed to the bottle but lining up the nozzle with the handles became difficult.We like this brand and style but immediately went with the larger size.Cleanup is very easy and when he is ready you can take out the diaphragm and turn these into a full sippy cup.The only problem...So, I'm saving that for when we have a baby girl!I went to the store and picked out a blue one myself...But I ordered this sippy cup and another, and they both came in pink, which was a bit much.We shipped both back, so I can't comment on attributes other than color.It would be nice if one could choose color/design.Otherwise be prepared for a lot of pink.She likes the metal feel of the fork on her teeth, probably feels better than the fake feeling of plastic in her mouth.These are seriously the best toddler flatware I've been able to find, but the pricing on this is ridiculous at $19.99.Hopefully, Amazon.com will fix this crazy pricing!The handles are easy for my toddlers to hold.My 20 month old uses them as well as my 3 yr old.The funny thing is, their 60 yr old grandma uses them too!She has had some trouble with her hands and finds holding these handles is more comfortable than stnd silverware.The silver fork tip (as opposed to plastic) appeals to my daughter b/c it is more like "mommy's fork".The fork is the right size for toddlers mouths and the prongs are dull enough not to hurt themselves, but pointed enough to stab food.(I just laugh at those other brand's  silly forks with round nodules on them, b/c you can't stab food with those.)The spoons and knives are great too.and the small size knives can double as butter knives at the dinner table.We got these for my daughter when we noticed that she was having a hard time with the forks from Gerber with the rounded tips.We hesitated but she did really well.The handle has helped in her learning the right way to hold her fork.They wash well and are the best.I ordered this pack because forks seem to mysteriously vanish in my house.The thin plastic ones that often have characters on them always rust or the handles will crack and fall apart but these don't have those problems.The handle on this spoon is very nice, it seems to fit well in my 13 month old son's small hand and be easy to hold.The bowl of the spoon is very wide, but he doesn't seem to mind shoving it into his mouth!We've been washing them on the bottom rack of the dishwasher with the other silverware for several months and they seem to hold up fine..but great product, good quality and nice grippy handle so he will grow into it.With four kids we've tried all kinds of toddler spoons and these are far and away the best.They are not too deep and not too shallow.The handle is just the right size and shape.The part the child eats off of is stainless steel rather than plastic and there is no paint on them to come off or cause a recall.These spoons are great!I would rate this as a must have!I think this spoon is good for early on.Nice and soft with a long handle, though a bit too flexi, if baby just pushes it a little that food goes flying since the tip is almost flat (it barely holds any food).Since it doesn't hold much that is good for the beginning but they learn to eat and tolerate more so quickly it was almost a waste to buy it I suppose.As soon as they want more the feeding takes longer (very frustrating to little ones who are hungry!)Summary: a little too pricey and flexi, but super soft and doesn't hold too much for a new eater.This bag is okay for a weekend bag, and that's all we really use it for.If we go visit parents for the weekend, we pack extra clothes and things in it, but as far as an every day bag, I definitely would never use this for that.It comes with a really cheap wipe case that won't stay shut.I guess its a get what you pay for type bag, as it is pretty inexpensive.I bought this specifically to be a weekend bag, so it works for my purposes, but I wanted to mention that its certainly not a good every day bag at all.Spend more on a decent bag for that.I use it around the house a lot to get something done while baby is sleeping as well as using it to go to the mall and grocery shopping.I am going to use this as my new shower gift option because I think EVERY mom should have one.Also, the owl decoration is SUPER cute!The Moby wrap is a great way to hold your baby and still get things done.There's something comforting for both Mom (or Dad!)and baby about being so close.The Moby came in especially handy when we were out and about at places where the stroller wasn't an option.Until then, though, I couldn't live without it!I tried using my Ergo carrier with the insert to regain freedom with my hands and arms, but it's just too hot in the summer to wear.The first time I put her in the wrap, she calmed right down.Now at 4 months she calms at the sight of the wrap and falls asleep within seconds of getting in.The Moby wrap is like having an "off switch" for my little one and has become a part of our bedtime routine.I also love the owl print!This product can feel a little thick in the summer, but I still love it!It makes running errands so much easier, I skip the stroller and just pop my baby into this.It's pretty easy to use once you do it a few times.I like to go ahead a put it on at the house before I leave because then I don't have to worry about it while I'm standing in the parking lot.I'm a thicker Mom and this product still works great for me, so if your on the larger side I say go for it it'll probably work for you too.I have the owl print and it's so cute.I ordered this and it shipped so fast!It was one of the first things I bought when I found out we're expecting.I loved the design, and I can say it's even better in person.SO many compartments, really well made and durable.I haven't actually USED this yet, but I can just tell it's going to be a great product that will LAST.I was so excited about it as it was mostly black with the lime green piping.I thought it was gender neutral enough that my husband didn't mind carrying as well.When my baby was about 3 months old, I noticed that it was starting to fray on top near the zipper.Pretty quickly that seam began to disintegrate into an ugly fabric canyon.Now, here I sit shopping for a new and more durable diaper bag...bummer!I absolutely love this diaper pail system.We used the Diaper Genie with my first child, and it was awkward and inefficient.The Diaper Genie had the access door on the bottom of the pail, and you had to lift it up and awkwardly try to dump what my husband called "poopy sausage links" into a trash bag.Plus, there was a lot of moisture retained in the unit, which led to odors aside from the diapers themselves and made me worried about mold and mildew.We got the Munchkin/Arm & Hammer system last minute when I decided not to try cloth diapers.Man am I glad!Plus, the unit twists itself closed, so you don't have to manually twist it every time.I would definitely recommend this to anyone who asks, over anything else available.It also smelled bad and the liners were very expensive!I gave the Arm and Hammer diaper pail by Munchkin 4 stars because isn't hands-free like the Diaper Genie II Elite and the less I have to touch a diaper, the better.But the Arm and Hammer diaper pail is incredibly easy to change liners, it holds in the stink much better, it's less complicated, and the liners cost less.This diaper pail is an easy way to keep your house smelling clean.I had a diaper gene and also one that used regular garbage bags.The diaper gene was a pain to set up and changing the bag meant a bit of work.The one that used regular bags didn't keep the smell down, attracted flies, and smalled horrible when changing.This one is easy to load and easy to change!They all operate the same between changes, just lift the lid and push the diaper down.There is only one drawback, which is why I gave this 4 stars.At first this was quite annoying, and it does start to collect on nearby objects, but now I hardly notice it (except having to wipe the table next to it down from time to time).However, baby powder is an inhilation hazard, and baking soda seems awfull similar, so I wouldn't use this with children right next to it.For that reason, it deserves 4 stars instead of 5.First off, it was pretty much put together right out of the box.All I had to do was install the bag inside.Just snap in the bag inside, which has a plastic ring on it that snaps in.I will say though that I do like the Arm & Hammer part to it which after opening and closing the diaper pail, it dispenses baking soda.You just fill the cartridge yourself every few months.So for pros go, I like how easy the cartridges snap in.I like that they hold a good amount of diapers and are easy to dispose of.I have not noticed any smell at all which is a definite plus!As far as cons go, I am not fond of the size first of all as I said it is shorter so I have to bend down.Next, I am not fond of how you have to open it.You need to clip the handle and pull up, which was a little difficult to do one handed.Finally you do have to really push a diaper in to get it down.Overall, I am not sure if I would buy this diaper pail, but it does do the job of keeping smells out.It is reasonably priced as are the refills.It has been our only disposable diaper pail and so I have little experience to compare it with any others.It does control odor well, but I wish they had designed it to be a little more efficient.It's very small and not convenient to use while in the middle of changing a diaper.If I have an extra stinky diaper and want to dispose of it immediately (rather than wait until my daughter is changed, dressed, and off to play), I have to bend way over (it's a very short pail, and I'm only 5'4"), open it and force the diaper through the opening.:-/Since it's so small the capacity to hold dirty diapers isn't as great as I'd like, and as soon as it gets close to full I have to force the lid closed - which makes an awful noise and I feel like I'm going to break it every time.It gets the job done and controls odor, I just find the overall design slightly annoying.I wish they'd made it bigger to hold more and taller to be easier to reach while in the middle of changing a diaper with your infant on the table.I never really felt the need for a diaper pail, especially since none of them really got RAVE reviews.Besides, I liked the ease of the stainless steel garbage can with foot pedal that we were using, and it was small enough that a scented stick-up helped with the odor and it was small enough that we were emptying it once a day anyway.So, the Munchkin diaper pail is the first actual diaper pail we've used in the 11 months since my son was born, and honestly I only tried it because it was made available to me to review through Amazon Vine.My thoughts?It's just somewhat disconcerting to have to squish the diaper through a hole, and I now have to take A LOT MORE care in closing/wrapping the dirty diaper so there are no accidental messes.That said, I haven't had any messes yet.My second least-favorite thing is the way you have to open the lid.It takes some practice to be able to open it with one hand, and becomes a tad more difficult if you're trying to manage a wiggly baby.I like the baking soda idea, though I don't know if it is really necessary - I haven't tried it without it though.This pail does keep odors under control.People who say a breast fed baby has odorless poop are wrong.It may be true with some kids - or it may be that they just don't smell as bad as formula fed babies, but my daughter definitely has horrendous smelling poops and I like that I can't smell the diapers in this pail.This diaper pail also doesn't take up much space which is good because we are in a small apartment.I think that this pail holds a decent amount of diapers too.It does get hard to close the lid as the bag gets full, but that lets me know its getting full, so its not such a bad thing.About $6 for a box of 10 that lasts about a month.My favorite thing about this diaper pail is how easy it is to set up.It is a bit more complex than I would like to see in a product that basically holds garbage.There are actually quite a few moving plastic parts from the diaper sealing mechanism to the side door for emptying.That makes me a bit wary about breakage.The side door that is used to empty the diapers is ok but can also be a little awkward in getting the things out.The bags get sealed pretty well.My biggest gripe and for me a deal breaker is that I hate the idea of having to but the special bag inserts.The pail itself is around 30 bucks.The refills run around 7 bucks for 10 bags that hold 25 diapers each.We intentionally chose a diaper pail that does not require special refills.Not only does that save money but it is so much more convenient to not have to worry about finding and buying a particular brand insert that stores may or may not have.Just use the same bag that goes in your kitchen garbage can that you can buy on sale and in bulk.It does come fully assembled with the first bag installed right out of the box.Overall it's a diaper pail, but it still has a cool factor to it.Every time you close the lid the bag twists a bit and it dumps in some baking soda.Easy to change the bag and use one handed.Pros:Fair on odor control (Short bag life.I may update after we head back to daycare and our at home diaper use drops and the bag life extends...)Baking soda dispenser is reusable!(It's also easy to clean)Feels solid and well built.Cons:Holds "~25 newborn diapers" per the box... My 18month old over the holidays was doing about 2-3days a bag or about 15 diapers.The hole to shove the diapers through isn't really sized for the diapers my toddler delivers so there is a push it through factor on some of the ones you really don't want to push.It's also about the coolest thing ever to my toddler.As is poking at the bag inside and hiding toys under it...Product improvements I'd suggest for the next version:MUST improve the lock on the door to make it kid proofAbility to put refill box in the door would be nice.This diaper pail really stinks, haha.The lid doesn't close unless you get into an arm wrestling match with it.Even when it does close, it is so LOUD.The bags are expensive.The door doesn't close, which seems like a major health risk to a crawling baby with the plastic bag inside.Overall, definitely don't recommend.After all, it is *poop* and its very nature is its stinkyness.I was unhappy with the Diaper Champ because it complicated but it still made the room smelly.Every time you flipped the thing, the smell was so bad your eyes would cross.But this Munchkin pail was a great improvement.I think that helped a lot.Initially, it kept falling out and caused great frustration but then I figured out I was supposed to screw it into the top, not just pop it in like I had been doing.So once that was remedied, I liked this pail a lot more.I also like that the lid makes a tight seal when it is closed so smells do not escape.My husband claims that this pail is easier to empty out than the Diaper Champ too.But that said there are some downsides.I also wish it would hold more diapers.I have a 14 month old and it seems like we're changing that thing every 48 hours.But overall, I would recommend this.It has made our changing station area much more bearable.I initially had a Diaper Champ after debating between that one and the Diaper Genie.Once she started eating regular food the odor every time you turned over the handle was horrific.So the search began for a new pail.I just bought the Arm & Hammer scent disks that I will hopefully place in the pail or on the side of the pail to help with the odor overall.You also need to change the bags more frequently than other pails, but with those loaded diapers that's not such a bad thing!And, the bag mechanism is much better than the DC too!After having a Diaper Genie that I really didn't like (was a PITA to change out bags and was a stinking pain to empty.I was taking the whole Diaper Genie to the trash can and dumping the bag out at the trash can there because I was afraid the bags would burst), I resolved to just using a small trash can with a foot pedal.I changed this often and was ok with the stink because it wasn't worse than the Diaper Genie, but was easier to empty.I saw this diaper pail in the store shortly after it came out and bought it right away to try.When you put the diaper in, just push it past the prongs (or even just most of the way) and close the lid.It will twist the bag slightly to keep the stink in when you add the next diaper.The only time I smell stink from this is if it hasn't been changed in a long time (meaning approximately 2 weeks), and no one who uses disposables full time goes that long without it becoming full (I cloth diaper my child, but a child that I watch for family uses disposables).I've even been known to put just soiled disposable wipes in there and I just barely push part through, and then when you close the lid, the twisting action pulls the rest of the wipe(s) down.I've used this diaper pail for well over a year and I've only on my third 3 box of refills (as I said, I cloth diaper mainly so my bags don't get emptied really often).The only two things that I don't like about this diaper pail is that when it gets almost full, you can close the lid without feeling like your going to break it.At that point, if I can't empty it right away, I just kind of shake the diaper pail side to side with one hand (other is on the baby on the changing table) and then I'm able to close it (sometimes the diapers don't fill out parts of the bag and just plop on top of each other so by doing this, it makes them fill those spaces).I have mixed feelings about this diaper pail, but since it's the only one we've bought I can't really compare it to any others.The bags need to be changed every few days, so you are going to go through a lot of refill packs.I don't know if it's just that we got a lemon, or if it's due to the cheap construction (definitely buy this on sale- it is very cheaply made!Also closing the lid often makes a very loud sound.I think it is because it turns the bag shut and the more diapers you put in it, the harder of a time it has turning the bag shut since it's heavier.So maybe it is a design flaw.However, having the bags shut probably does help keep the smell factor low.Overall I am not sure I would buy it again, but since it works we'll use it for now.There is no odor and it's so easy to use.I guess I don't have any of the problems others talk about.I would recommend in the strongest possible way no one ever buy this product.The other reviews of this product are all too kind and they say so in their descriptions.All of them point out that the product does not work smoothly or seem to do anything magically different, they also seem to give 3+ stars without comparing the product to anything else.I have compared the product to something else...a regular trash can...and the regular trash can was better.And the regular trash can didn't even have a lid on it.A family friend also purchased this thing and has the exact same complaints.Namely that the lid gets stuck, that you have to hunch over and shove the diapers into the pail, and that you have to buy replacement bags every month or few weeks.In the end this thing is a waste of money and is simply worse than a regular old trash can.The lid is supposed to keep out odors while sprinkling a tiny (really tiny) amount of baking soda as you close it and initiating a mechanical twist of the bag to further seal off the odors.However, the lid is constantly fighting with the mechanics that twist the bag creating, starting when then bag gets about half full, a series of sounds reminiscent of small arms fire.Closing the lid twists the top part of the bag in a ring of rubber shark-like teeth thereby closing off the bag as well.However, the lid will often simply get stuck open because these rubber teeth put too much pressure on the mechanics of the lid.This forces you to stick your hand into the pail itself and move the bag around to relieve the pressure so the lid will close.Think about it...you have to stick your hand into the very closure intended to keep odors out.Very often you have to decide between fixing the lid or picking up a now grumpy baby.2) The rubber teeth are a pain.Often the rubber teeth create to much counter pressure to the closing of the lid and the entire process comes to a plastic cracking halt.Every time you change a diaper you have to bend down and shove your hand through a set of rubber teeth two feet off the floor.And two feet off the floor is correct.This thing barely comes up to my kneecaps.Think about it...even when working 100% correctly you have to bend over two feet and jam your fist partially through a set of rubber teeth.A bag lasts you maybe 4 days at a max and more like 48 hours.Munchkin wants you to fork out whatever bucks a month for replacement bags?I think this is the entire reason for the mechanical twisting of the bags and not to keep in smells.The tops of the bags have plastic ring you set into the top of the pail and which then snaps into place.The replacement bags are only 5-10 bucks a box but it seems like a real scam.I have tried two things.Nothing bad happened at all.I dumped the diapers into the outside trash and put the bag back.No smells, no nastiness, nothing bad happened at all.I used the same bag for two weeks rather than two days.After two weeks of us there were still no smells.B) I then decided to try a regular trash bag.It worked fine.You just have to leave a bit of the bag sticking out beyond the lid to make sure the rubber teeth don't pull the thing completely into the pail when you close the lid.4) The baking soda does nothing.A novel idea sure.But, like the twisting of the bags, it seems like a gimmick.I do not see how either is doing much to absorb odors.Alternatives:The only alternative I have used is an old plastic trash can with an open bag in it and no lid.No smells whatsoever.The other half of the time it was 90 degrees and the air conditioning was on.In both cases it worked out fine.No smells.Conclusions:Do not buy this munchkin monstrosity.Every time you use it you will wonder if the lid will close or start making cracking noises as it struggles to twist the bag.Buy a trashcan with a lid.Maybe one with a step lid.And if your kid makes a smelly one.Empty the trash can.The munchkin is a gimmicky thing and not worth it at all.It seems like a great idea but in actuality the thing does not work!Holds a small amount of diapers.You have to push the diaper down the bag-not good if have a full diaper!Only good thing is very little smell when you open the lid.Overall, don't waste your money.We had never used a pail before and my wife wasn't that keen on starting to use one, but we thought we would give the Munckin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail a try when it came up on Amazon Vine.Our son is now 18 months old and it is the first time we've used a pail--it is definitely not on your must haves in terms of baby products, especially if you are on a budget.That being said, it is a convinient addition to the nursery.Before we used recycled grocery bags and threw diapers away individually.With the Munchkin we no longer have to do that.The bags seal around a plastic O-ring each time you close the lid, and baking soda is sprinkled onto it to control odor.It will hold about 2 days of diapers, or less if you are just too skeeved out about keeping any more diapers in one spot.You can quickly see full the bag is by opening the front of the system.Like others have mentioned, you really have to touch the diaper a lot to push it down into the bag.With an older baby, this really isn't fun.This system won't work unless you buy the refillable bags, so you need to factor that into the decision.The bags run about $0.50 each; not terribly expensive, but more expensive than free (if you currently use plastic grocery bags).I had been using the diaper genie and I hate using the design there.This one is much easier to use.Smell is negligible.It never really caught on in our house.I didnt think the openings were very big.If you must have a tray to divide snacks in, then I would consider getting something with a little more room.I have used this nibble tray for myself!The only downside is that it's not leak-proof.The only complaint is that the fork is pretty dull with flat-ended prongs so it is difficult for her to stab and pick up any food with it.It's more like a spork!With the "kid" dishes we had before I always felt like we were giving them too much food, because it's habit to fill the plate/bowl, and the kids were never finishing their dinners.I will purchase another set for my third child, who is on the way, when she is a little older.I use these on both my 34 lb toddler and my 13 lb 3 month old and they fit both well.To fit a younger baby you fold the diaper in thirds short ways and for older babies you fold long ways.The cover has three settings that you snap and unsnap to make fit whatever size child you have.I've also never had any leaks with either of my children and I'd say the econobum prefolds keep breastmilk poo off the covers better than the flip inserts(the flips inserts hold less pee too and leak with my toddler).There is just something about Sophie...Spent hours trying to put the two main pieces (blue stand)and the yellow seat collar together.The bearing wheels in the seat collar won't stay in place.Everytime I tried to snap the collar to the blue stand piece, the bearing wheels got twisted.Not all of them stays in place where it should be.Some got stuck.Nice concept but poor workmanship.Among all the baby entertainment center I bought (Fisher Price Jumper, Graco Baby Einstein Activity Center, Evenflo Exersaucer, Combi Walker) this Bright Start brand is by far the most difficult to assemble or take apart.Very frustrating.Toys on the other hand, are very atractive and interesting.Update.I've changed the review from a 3 to a 4.He was too young for it when I first wrote this, and it's true I'm not a fan of plastic.However, it last a long time and we have passed it down to my nephew.I was so excited to get it because my baby wanted to be sitting upright and to be busy all the time.As soon as I put it together though, I realized that my son's legs were way too short(he's not small for his age my any means).I just took the table top off and let him play with it on the floor.He would sit there and entertain himself with the piano for quite a while.When he changed the "pages" of the sheet music, it changes the keys from playing full songs, to individual key notes, to cute sounds: "pop", "cuckoo-cuckoo", etc.This is probably the least entertaining (maybe FP would consider putting something more interesting in its place.)My son just grew tall enough to reach his feet to the bottom at seven months.But now by the time he grew tall enough to fit it, he's more interested in being able to scoot around the house (in his FP walker), so won't stay in it very long without complaining.I bought this for my little guy when he was about 4 months old.What I liked about it was the feature of how it could "grow with them."The bad thing I found out is that there is a shift to the top that can't be locked into place.I am pretty disappointed with it.The toys included are pretty lame and difficult to reach from the seat (my son is pretty tall for 5 months - 27.5 inches).We also own the ABC ExerSaucerEvenflo ExerSaucer SmartSteps - ABCand he much prefers that.Plus Evenflo sells "switch-a-roos" so you can rotate the toys to keep things interesting.My older one is to heavy to sit in the seat, but loves to show my little one how to make things work.So it isn't always the same thing.It went together easily in under an hour, but that was me putting it together alone with kids playing around me.It has a couple "bowls" built in for holding things.I hope to get years of use out of this center.The first day we got this swing and put our 3 month old on the swing, he fell asleep right away.Our 3 month old is the type of baby that you need to rock to sleep, so this swing was just perfect.So, I definitely recommend this swing to anyone that has the same issues or just wants their baby to be rocked by a swing instead of manually.The product has three timer settings - 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and 45 minutes.This is great to make sure the baby falls asleep before the swing shuts off.Also, this product has many swing speed settings - but we usually just set it to the first or second slowest swing speed because the faster swing speeds looked uncomfortably fast.Our baby doesn't like to lay flat on his back most of the time, so we put him on the semi-reclined position and he's fine.The swing is also portable and folds up easily.I bought this swing because I wanted something I could use anywhere, such as in the yard or on a picnic etc.Go figure...Pros:Very compact.This swing will fold up ultra compact and fit into small storage areas.Let's put it this way.I have a regular sliding door closet with 2 bouncers, a walker and 3 storage totes and this thing slid right in next to the folded walker.I have a hatchback Toyota Yaris and this thing fits in the car with ease.Long Battery Life.I have used the same batteries now for 5 months and they are still going strong.The motor and music has a timer on it which allows you to determine when it wil stop.And, conveniently, lets say you forget to turn it off after you grab your baby, it will turn off after awhile regardless if you set the timer or not.Sturdy design.My 2 year old toddler loves to play with this thing when I'm not looking.He will pull it out of the closet, set it up, turn it on and sit in it.He's too heavy for it and obviously doesn't make sure its set up correcty before plopping himself in it but the little swing can handle that every once in awhile.Cons:My cons are all personal really.Nothing releated to the design.My youngest simply doesn't like it.Nothing that the manufacturer could have changed to prevent that.She's now 9 weeks old and we still use it daily.It's very easy to transport from room to room and stores so easily when ready to put away which is important when you have a full house.The swing does slow a little slower now that baby has been gaining weight but that comes with any portable swing, but my baby will still sleep for hours in it and the material is very comfortable and soft for baby.However every time it shuts off I usually have to restart it if babys still asleep but it's no big deal.My 4+ month old, 19 lb.Toy bar is a little difficult to attach, can't change the toys, but otherwise a great buy for an inexpensive swing.(and I spent a lot of time researching swings)The only negative is when he is napping, I can't have the toy bar going across because it is basiclly in his face!It is very nice to have when he is awake, he loves batting and putting the toys in his mouth.This product was easy to put together, I had no problems.Like the other reviews say, It doesn't collapse so it would be difficult to take on vacation or to a different house.Overall, I am VERY happy with this bouncer, and you especially can't go wrong with the price!I would recommend this bouncer over any bouncer out there, especially fisher price.I have only had problems with my fisher price bouncer AND swing!My daughter sleeps so well in it, I think mainly because of the bolster pillows on the sides which are similar to the z-flow she slept on when she was in the NICU.I have washed it several times and it's awesome to be able to just toss it in the washing machine without worrying about it getting out of shape.It also dries quickly (I don't put it in the dryer) when laid flat.The problems- the unit that vibrates and plays music had stripped screws so I wasn't able to  put the batteries in.I emailed them to let them know, I got a reply back that day asking if I wanted a blue unit right away or if I wanted to wait a little while for a beige one.The blue still matches, so I ordered that one.It arrived within a few days and works great.The toy bar is meant to slide on and off but there is a catch to keep it from just falling.One side was missing that catch, so the bar constantly came undone.We got this bouncer when our son had colic, and needed to sleep sitting up much of the time.However, my only gripes are these: it is hard to adjust the angle with the baby in it, and it has alot of padding along the side of the bouncer, making me worry that he will turn his face into it and have difficulty breathing.To solve this, we pinned back the sides, and now I feel much more comfortable with it.We also have the Fisher Price Infant to Toddler Rocker and the Baby Bjorn, and like this one just as much if not better for newborns, though I'm sure the other two will be preferable as he gets older.It's a great bouncer but it becomes useless when the batteries are dead and I get sick of replacing them constantly.Customer Service: One of the legs did not fit into the frame of the seat properly.I called customer service and explained my dilemma and they were friendly and promptly shipped me out the replacement parts.Pros:- Very soft and plush- Sturdy toy bar that can be moved back easily to pull baby out- Machine washable cover (toy bar is spot clean)- Decent amount of vibration- Pretty simple to put together- Easily bounces with your foot so its not tiring- Good customer serivce- Recline position for newborns- Very simple mechanism to switch between reclined and sitting upCons:- Goes thru batteries pretty quickly** Edited 10/28/10 **After using this bouncer for several months I found that the batteries will last over a month if you do not use the music option.If you use the music the batteries will drain very quickly.So if you do not plan on using the music very much this bouncer would be really good.If you do want to use the music, be prepared to fork out a lot of money for batteries.The toys are simple, but my daughter enjoys batting at them and has had some recent success grabbing the lady bug's legs.My only complaint is the head cushion- it provides little to no support.My daughter is now 3 months old and it still does not keep her head in a nice neutral position when she is sleeping.She always looks incredibly awkward and her neck looks strained.As these are my 4th and 5th children, I can testify to having tried many different kinds of bouncers.The cushions literally surround the newborn's body, making them feel safe and secure while they rest.-Music and sounds that are not EXTREMELY annoying; vibrations that don't shake the baby until he/she vomits!My twins spend much of their days in these bouncers, and I am SO happy with this purchase.This has been doing the job for our newborn son for almost 2 weeks now.Pros:-Simple to assemble-Stable base (quite wide though -- a negative for some, depending on your space)-Toy bar with adjustable position-Good vibrate feature -- pleases our son, inaudible from a few feet away in a normal active room, shuts itself off after awhile to preserve batteries (haven't timed it yet, but it goes for a good long time first)-Tolerable music, though our newborn is unaffected by it so far-Easily bounces gently with minimal movement from a newbornCons:-Straps for the harness always end up lying right where you're going to put the baby, so you have to dig them out from under him/her just as you're hoping he/she might stay sound asleep.It would be nice if there were a pocket or something on each side to tuck them into to keep them up along the sides of the seat, instead of right under baby.-Quite wide -- only a problem if you have limited space in which to put it-Wish it were a little easier to move around the house or had a folding feature, but this is not a deal breaker and I'll sacrifice portability for stability at the moment.We've been using it several times daily for about 5 weeks and we haven't had to replace the batteries!i have used it for about two weeks now and still have yet to change the batteries.my duaghter loves her swing so we use it quite a bit.i also enjoy that it automatically shuts off in about an hour (even if you dont set the timer).pretty light-i can hold my newborn in one arm and carry the swing in the other.would definately recommendi absolutely hate this thing.first of all, it's not comfy.maybe if your baby starts out in this thing, it's ok, but if you are expecting a super plush soft place for your little one to take naps, this is not it.secondly, the sounds are either too quiet or too loud.thirdly, and worst of all, my child almost fell out of this on numerous occasion.it's almost too flat and the baby can slide right out with just a little bit of movement.we sent ours back.i would spend $40 more and get the my little lamb swing.its the best swing ever and our 4 month old son still takes naps in it!I am a mom of two and have owned several baby swings.My kids needed the swings to get them to sleep when they were infants - if you have a bad back and can't rock your child, then a swing is what you need!Yes, they eat through batteries, but who cares when your child will sleep 4 hours in the swing as opposed to 1 hour in the crib!But I digress...As for this travel swing:Pros:Much more portable than a full size swingMore portable than the fisher price travel swing (I had the ocean wonders model)Folds pretty flat for travelNo noise at all (the full-size models always click when swinging)Decent battery life for a swingEasy to assembleHas a recline optionDecent music if you want itTimer if you want it, or just leave the swing on constantlyCute to look at for you and babyEasy to cleanCons:"Speed" settings are really all 1 speed - why bother with a speed dial?This seems to be typical of all swings though, both travel and full-sized.Will never move as vigorously as a full-sized swing - top speed is barely moving in comparison to a full-sized swing.If your child is used to a full-sized swing, this swing might not move vigorously enough to rock him/her to sleep.However, if they are not used to a full-sized model than this one might be fine.A tip for all swings: Use good batteries (Duracell only) to get the most vigorous swinging out of your swing.The cheap ones, even Energizers, will barely move your swing!Update: 1 BIG CON for this swing that I discovered last night - it automatically shuts off after 1 hour, even without using the timer feature.I wanted it to run continuously like the full-size swing would, but it won't.Why include a timer for 15 minute increments if the swing shuts off in 1 hour anyway?My babies wake up when the swing stops, which is exactly what happened.Argh!This makes the swing fairly useless to me if I want my baby to sleep in the swing during the night, because she will wake every hour when the swing automatically shuts off!The swing itself functions fine, but the straps are extremely stiff/rough.Many experts say to bring your child to the store to try out each swing to see which one they like but who can do that?I wanted to have one at home when he arrived.So we picked a travel ready swing.The swing itself is super cute, good quality, and looks exactly as advertsied.But our son cries the second we turn on the swing part.We use it now just to sit him.He likes the vibrating bouncy better.I recommend trying it our first.It is a good product, just not for my son.This toy has saved the day on long car trips.My son adored this thing at the age of 4 months, when we got it.He's seven months old now, and this is still his favorite car toy.The octopus's face is so friendly that he can stare and talk to it for an unbelievably long time.This is a really great toy.We introduced Mr. Octopus (we call him that too!)He couldn't grab yet but we would crinkle the tentacles and play the music for him.Now that he is 6 months, we can't go anywhere without this toy!He can now grab the tentacles and crinkle and chew on them as much as he wants.He chews on all the rings and snuggles with it in his car seat and the music does (most of the time) stop the bored tears.So far, I've just been spot cleaning it but does anyone know if there's a more thorough way to clean the whole body?He gets dropped/thrown on various floors a lot (restaurants) so I take it into the bathroom and dab it with paper towels but I'd just like a more thorough cleaning when we get home.I really went looking for a nice shopping cart / high chair cover to use with my 7 month old son.I was drawn to this one because of the bright blue colors, it really compliments the baby, and I've had more than a few comments: )The Good:- It's not bulky.Folds up well.- Simple design- Pockets in the back for storing items- Two reinforced feet holes for baby's legs- Elastic that fits well around the handles of the shopping cart so baby won't lean over and suck on the handle bar.- For a standard shopping cart it covers well!- Strap in the back to attach the cover to the grocery cart for security.The Bad:- Most covers fold into themselves making it easier to carry; this feature isn't a big deal for me, but to be able to roll up the cover and clip it together would have been nice.Unfortunately with this you end up stuffing it under your arm making carrying baby, purse, and cover a bit difficult.- The cover includes one strap to attach it to a grocery cart, but not one to strap the baby in.There are holes for the straps of the grocery cart, but I've found some store straps are just too short, so baby wasn't able to be strapped in at all.That was a big disappointment!It would have been nice to have a fall back option.- Shopping cover works well on standard carts, but on a oversized cart like the one's at Costco, or Sam's Club, you have to pull it over in the back and it doesn't fit well.Overall it's a nice cover that works well.But I was really bummed that the cover didn't come with it's own strap to secure baby, it would have been a nice added feature.On a side note, this cover is very similar to the Boppy Cart Cover, which they sold with a similar pattern, but isn't being sold any more.I wonder if they were designed and manufactured by the same company some how.Our child enjoys standing on the wheelie board when he just doesn't want to sit in the stroller anymore.It was easy to assemble and even easier to operate once attached, but the restraining cord is a little weak to take the weight of the board, causing it to open on more than one occasion.Many heads turn and smile, too, when they see this in action!This doesn't have a drawstring top, it's an elastic top (kind of like underwear elastic).Color selection is good, too (we got the orange, it's very bright).My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is how sopping wet it gets in the washer.I line dry this, and it *does* dry overnight in our NorthEast climate... but while taking it out of the washer, it's a wet mess and you have to ENSURE you dry it with the 'fabric' side out, else it'll just hold the water (proof that it's truly waterproof).However, I would purchase again, no question.I am so disappointed in these diaper pail liners.I got two in celery (currently unavailable) to use in rotation.I loved them until after two months I noticed holes towards the top (near the elastic, but not on seam) and subsequently stopped putting them in the dryer.I'm not rough on things at all, so I'm really shocked they fell apart after such a short period of time.I LOVE their wet/dry bags and use them often, but don't need to wash as often as I need to wash my diaper pail liners.Such a shame.I really like this as a diaper bag but am still undecided as to whether I will keep it.As a diaper bag alone - love everything about it.It's also a huge plus for me that this bag is completely PVC and Phthalate free.The only thing I don't care for is how stiff and structured the bottom is.I keep my stuff AND my kid's stuff in the same bag.So the stiff bottom doesn't feel very comfortable when it's over the shoulder - it pushes my arm out instead of conforming under my arm and sitting closer to my body.If it had just a little slouch or give to it when you put it over the shoulder I wouldn't even consider returning it.For now I will keep trying it on to see if I can get used to it because I love the bag otherwise.I loved this bag when I first got it.The outside material looks like leather but is actually made of some glossy, lightly textured thick material which wipes clean without stains.The inside has a thin umbrella-like material.Unfortunately, this bag is not practical.It doesn't close completely on the top, and it is narrow.So when the bag falls over, half my things tumble out.The magnetic snap that holds the top "closed" is only an inch wide, so you can see everything inside the bag.Yes, this lets you put more stuff in, but having your bag that full doesn't look very nice.In fact, I got this bag thinking it would be big enough for cloth diapers, but it only holds about 4 pocket diapers.Also, it sticks out a lot in the back when you carry it on your shoulders.I was in a store with narrow aisles and starte hearing things fall on the floor.I went to pick up the things, and as I stood up, more things fell on the ground.I turned around to see what happened... and knocked more things over.Aargh!!I just got the green bag and I can't wait to start using it.The green looks exactly as it does on my computer.I can't imagine that I will need more room for all my baby stuff.In fact, I think I'll be ditching my own purse so that I only carry the one bag once the baby arrives.update.I have now been using the bag for 2 months.It is really too small for anything but a really quick dash to the store.Once I had the baby I realised just how much stuff I have to take with me each time I leave home.This bag doesn't hold half of it.The fact that the bag doesnt close is a big problem as stuff is always sticking out and it just looks untidy.Plus I use glass bottles so I am always afraid they will fall out and break.I will definitely have to get a bigger bag.I give this bag 5 for looks and 2 for practicalityI REALLY wanted a Combi carseat.We have a Combi double stroller that I am thrilled with, and I also know that Combi has a good safety rating.Well, first of all, this carseat - the violet one - is not as pictured color-wise.The color is actually a BRIGHT periwinkle, and I think it's much too girly for boys - at least for mine anyway.But even for being so bright, the carseat just looks very drab and boring.Anyway, as far as use, I didn't even install it in the car to try it out, because I thought the installation of the carseat itself into the base wasn't as easy as it could have been.Also, this was a little too big - in my mind - for smaller babies, which mine were/are.They were preemies (but going home weights of 5 and 6 lbs), and this wasn't going to work even though the lower weight limit was in line with them.The carseat didn't snap in and I felt like it wasn't stable.I gave it three stars because it does have a good safety rating and it feels structurally solid, but costmetics and functionality cost it those last two stars.Our baby hasn't arrived yet, so I will update this review when we can actually put this seat to use, but so far, we love it!I spent a great deal of time researching car seats, as safety, comfort, style, and size were all HUGE issues with us.Finally settled on the Combi Shuttle due to it's safety ratings and overall features.Then, they came out with the Shuttle 33, which made our decision even tougher.We figured that the extra pound of car seat weight was worthwhile.Some have said they don't like the handle always having to be up while in the car, but I am on the other end.Putting the handle down just extends the length of the seat, pushing the front car seats even further forward.I do love that you can use the handle to prop the seat up for the baby to sit or nap in.The buckle is a little tough, as are all puzzle lock buckles, but safety first!It is soft, easily removed and super washable.ETA ~ We've now been using this seat for over 10 months, and still love it.We cloth diaper, so on days when we are out and use a disposable it makes it very simple to quick adjust.Awful decision that we regret every time we use the seat.1.Heavy beast, even without baby inside2.Hard to get baby in over the rebound bar3.When taking our baby out, his feet get caught under the rebound bar, a couple of times hard enough to make him cry in pain4.Our sunshade broke almost immediately on one side.It arrived broken.Total waste of time.It stopped working after 2 weeks.And I like that it saves energy by turning on only when it is darkThe Amazon listing doesn't mention it, but this item will not fit on a stroller with a hard plastic handle.It has to be a soft rubber or foam handle.Letting your other hand free for holding a toddlers hand, grabbing an item or taking a drink.Not only that but it is ergonomic, helping posture.This was especially nice for those who are taller, and we noticed that we didn't have to hunch over to walk with the stroller, and there was less strain in our arms and backs.Easy Stroll works on most strollers that have standard handles with rubber or foam hand grips.The installation can look a bit daunting, but grab a mommy friend, or the hubby to help you install in quickly.You'll love this product!When I first bought these diapers I was very excited to use them.Once I did I was disappointed.Pros- not as bulky as some diapers, and they are really cute, I have not had leak when he is awakeCons-  When the inserts get wet the shell gets wet as well and the odor is strong.I don't feel the insert was designed well.Its a great concept but not very functional.The sheets were soaked as well.He is 9 mos old and the first and only time this happened is when I put this diaper on him.These are the only diapers I have besides the prefold diapers so now I make sure to put on a prefold before a nap.I just recently ordered bumgenius and thirsties.I have been using disposables for overnights since my son is a heavy wetter.I am hoping with the new diapers I can eliminate the use of disposables.I know for sure the grobaby diapers won't work for that purpose.Pro's:-Once the liners for this diaper have been primed, they are quite absorbant.These have my favorite snaps and I love that the liner snaps into place.-Velcro is great for quick changes, my husband apreciates not having to line up the snaps.-They are very trim between the legs and the liners have a wide backside to them which is great for girls who pee a lot...My daughter.-they work GREAT with the Gro-baby disposable liners.Cons:-The liners are on the rough side, and once they are wet they feel VERY wet.For some reason, (and this is since I've had them and not the result of a terribly stinky potty) they STINK!I have several other types of liners and do not have this problem.They tend to bunch up around the genitals and are not very comfortable for him.I would like to have more of an hour glass shape to them since I use them for both of my kids.I would definately reccommend!My 12 month old is sooooo much happier now in this over the infant seat.It was easy enough to instal rear facing and I have not have any trouble with the buckles being hard to snap.The toys on this are better and my girls prefer to play with them, but the seat unit is so big that they are very unstable in it (including my bigger girl), so I have to put them in there with a baby boppy or towels and cushions etc which is a pain.They will both play in it for 30-45 minutes at a time, giving me a chance to get a few things done.I did replace two toys with Switch A Roos.We now have an Apple Book and a Chewy Fish - I'd hightly recommend both these items.I purchased this exersaucer because of good reviews, the price and the fact that it requires no batteries.We're saving a bit of money on this toy and both babies love it!She said I'd hate the jumparoo (which I don't... we do like it) but he loves this toy too.The older kids like showing him all the new toys and it allows him to interact with them face to face so he can feel like a big boy.His favorite toy is the one with the smiley face.I was iffy about this toy, but I'm *so* glad we have it!I am also fascinated that it is one of the few toys now a days that don't have any battery necessary parts yet it still is VERY amusing!I'm very glad I didn't get one with MORE "bells and whistles" because the stuff on this one is plenty, in fact i don't even use all the attachments at once because he gets overwhelmed.I can't imagine the overload from one of the crazy ones that costs more.This thing is plenty entertaining and it totally wears him out.The bad:  At 6 months old and only 70 percentile in height, he is (according to the instructions) already supposed to be on the highest height setting so that he's on tippytoe not flat footed.So that seems rediculous, he would outgrow on height almost immediately.I felt a little guilty buying DS the one of the cheaper exersaucers that didn't have dangly things overhead and took 12 batteries, but he indeed has tons of fun.At 6 mos, he's discovered the rocking and bouncing part and has a blast, not to mention refining motor skills with all the little toys.Also, I'm definitely a proponent of buying things used, but once I saw how most of the toys are within 'mouthing' distance, I was very happy that we got this new.Packed with toys a plenty, my almost 5 month old, adores this.It seems to be really helping to strengthen her core and it is amusing to watch her in it as well.It only took about ten minutes to set up and this may be one of the few toys we now have that doesn't require batteries (which is an added bonus for us :)PROS: Reasonably priced, doesn't require batteries, higher weight limit than most jumpers, interesting toys that can snap out and be exchanged.CONS: Springs in the legs sometimes snap out of place (easy to fix, but annoying), no 'kickstand' to stop the Exersaucer from wobbling aroundBEST USE: Around 6 months in age4 MONTHS: We bought this when our son was 4 months old, it took him another month to really grow into it.Had it come with some stoppers (old school exersaucers used to have them) it could have stayed still and been less scary, though he adjusted quickly.6 MONTHS: Ideal age, able to interact with toys, but because child is not really mobile - wouldn't object much to hanging out and playing.Would play for 30 minute clips easily.8 MONTHS: Nearly obsolete.While my son was still within the weight limit, he really didn't like to sit still.He might hang in there for 5-10 minutes, but no longer.12 MONTHS: Gave it away.RECOMMENDATION: Worth the investment.It provided a safe, entertaining place for my son to play if I had to run to the bathroom or couldn't closely monitor his playtime because I was preparing dinner or answering the phone.The bottom is concave so he can rock.It was easy to assemble and it has been VERY easy to clean - gotta like that!He really enjoys it - and we love watching him in it!My 5 month old is a very busy boy.As soon as we stuck him in this, he LOVED it.There are a lot of steps to putting it together, but it took about ten minutes.There are three height adjustments.My 5 month old is 50th percentile and already needs to be on the second setting.So, if you have a taller baby, he might grow out of it.She will probably be too tall for it in a few months but for the time it can used it was worth the price.This is very easy to put together (no tools needed) and we can transport it very easily (has a convenient carrying handle and is very lightweight)The longer handles are easy to hold and feed with, the larger end gives mom or dad an easy grip on the spoon.The spoon head is nice and narrow for little mouths, and is soft and shaped nicely for cleaning up dribble along the way.Although the handles are easier for parents to grip, they do tend to fall out of bowls easily, due to the larger ends.These are very good spoons for beginners, I sued since my baby was 4.5 month old.The long handle is a plus in the beginning as well, but it can also cause the spoons to fall out of the bowl because it is so long.The biggest drawback for me is that after a short period of use, the edges on the back of the spoons start peeling off (the thin layer of plastic or something starts coming off), and I stop using them and buy another set, which is much cheaper at babiesrus by the way.Also, if you use them on like sweet potatoes or carrots, the spoons may change color to an orange hue, not the handles though.The long handles are easy to hold.The plastic on the spoon part also starts to peel off, so we stopped using it.So the set of 4 spoons lasted a little over 3 months for me before I have to go buy another set.I'm going to try another brand to compare.This is a great baby toy.She also really loves the rattling star and the mirror tail.There is a crinkle patch too but I do wish it were bigger because she loves the crinkle sound on other Lamaze toys.I have several of the Lamaze Play and Grow toys.My baby got this around 4.5 months and is now 6.5 months.He really likes the felt feather in the hat.He's getting better at grabbing the rattle ball.The mirror does nothing for him, surprisingly.Over all, the toy is very cute and kinda reminds me of Captain Jack Sparrow which makes a lot of adults that see it like it as well.As far as comparing it to the other Lamaze Play in Grow Toys we have, I'd probably rank them in this order:1.Jacques the Peacock (excellent toy and perfect length to hang off the side of my diaper bag, I highly recommend)2.Freddie the Firefly (very good length to hang off the stroller visor)3.Captain Calamari4.Tina the Tiger5.Logan the LionI think he actually likes him more then Jacques the Peacock, only because he's a lot easier to grab at, and he bites on the rings..It is a bit big, but it fits okay in our stroller plus we hang it from our activity mat and he's obsessed with Captain Calamari!Definitely recommend it :)This toy is super cute and actually a bit larger than I thought it would be.He loves the two rings and the mirror on the bottom of it.I love how I can hook this to my sons stroller with no problem.Would definitely recommend to a friend.some of the arms and hat makes crinkly noises and when you move captain calamari around you hear the rattle and clunking noises from the 2 teething loops hitting the rattle.now i bought this for my baby and he isn't born yet so not sure how he'll like it so i'll update when he gets here but i've seen some babies on youtube playing w/ him and that's what won me over.This toy is cute and entertains my newborn.She likes to stare at him and his bright colors.This little stuffed cephalopod has always entertained my baby daughter since we got him months ago.The legs are lovely to chew on, the hat makes nice crinkly noises when clinched in teeny fists, and the secret mirror between his teNtacles (careful spelling that) is always a happy surprise while slobbering on the plastic teething rings.The Captain is bigger than I expected, making him actually cuddly, which is great.The noises he emits when being played with are never annoying, which is much appreciated.He can entertain both sexes without lacking personality, unlike some gender-neutral toys...I am looking at you Mr.Plain Yellow Duck.I tip my hat to the Captain for allowing me to wash the dishes for a FULL 20 minutes to the sounds of a delighted and entertained baby.We received Freddie the Firefly as a baby shower gift and my baby started playing with it at about 4 weeks old so I decided to buy more Lamaze toys to hang in his playgym.I purchased Captain Calamari and Logan the Lion.Captain is clearly the winner as my 8 week old baby spends a lot of time looking at and hitting it.Logan gets 2-3 minutes of attention, if that.There is just so much more action to Captain with the crinkly noises, squishy tentacles and noisy rattle.Baby loves the sounds and I love Captain for helping baby with hand-eye coordination as well as giving me at least 30 minutes to have breakfast in peace.This is the first toy that my daughter grabbed and liked.I sort of had to get it at that point.It's really cute, we named him 'Ruffles' because he has ridges on his belly.The only cons about this toy is the ring at the back of his neck is starting to come un-stitched and secondly, this toy is not washable in the washing machine, it's damp cloth wash only.That doesn't exactly help when your daughter projectile vomits up 8oz of formula all over the toy.I hang it on her swing and she stares and smiles at it all the time.This is a nice quality material that fits nicely on high chairs and standard shopping carts.If the maker added a stretchy band of material (in the back maybe?)so it would fit the huge shopping carts of the world it would definitely earn 5 stars.My son is 7 1/2 months old and we recently switched him from his infant carrier seat to a convertible car seat because of this I no longer had a clean place to keep him while we are at the store or out to eat.I am a germaphobe so when I saw this product I knew I had to have it.It is great, it covers the shopping cart 360 degrees making it a germ-free, clean place to put my son while we shop.My only complaint about the product is that the strap is a bit awkward to tighten, it's really long and there is a lot of excess material just hanging in the back after you tighten it but overall it's not really that big of a deal.Oh and contrary to what Balboa baby says, I don't think it fits nicely in a diaper bag, I think it's a bit too bulky for that, so I just leave it in the car and grab it when we need it.I would definitely recommend this, you need it and will use it way more than you think!!!The problem is that it's tall only on one side (6" or so) and on the other side (the one closest to your body) it is very short (about 3.5").This means the baby just rolls off and then in between the pillow and my body, pushing it out of the way.There is no way to keep baby on the pillow.This is the WORST design of any pillow I have tried, including the Boppy, and trust me, I have tried them all!I love how soft this sleep sack is!I can't wait to snuggle with my baby in Feb!I gave it a 4, because it is much smaller than other brands.If you are wondering about what size to go with, I would size up.I like these because I always save tons of little things of my kid's.I glued it back on with a hot glue gun but probably shoudn't have happened to something I paid almost thirty dollars for.I love my kokopax city carrier.I am a mom of 3.My two youngest are 2 and 5 months.I have a couple of pouch slings, but those aren't practical for cooking, housework, or other things that require both arms to be free.Take for example, the trips I was making to the grocery store prior to getting the Kokopax.My older son would be on the seat in the cart and my infant would be in his car seat taking up the entire cart space.I'd have to pile groceries underneath the cart.Also good for maybe 1 diaper, keys)looks goodbaby is comfortableI've had many mothers either looking at it or coming up to me asking where I got it.I use it nearly every day.My only complaint is that the fabric covering the padding on the lumbar support seems to be rubbing on my clothing and it is wrecking some of my clothing.This happened the very first time I used it.My daughter came up and asked what was all over the lumbar padding.I have one of those nylon, super stretchy tank tops that I wear under some t-shirts because I like the length and the layered look, but it really messed that tank top up in the spot where it rests against the Kokopax.It is pilling nearly all of my clothing.The padding now has multiple colors of pills from the various shirts that I have worn with it.If I didn't LOVE this carrier so much, that would have turned me away from the product.There has got to be a different fabric that can be used that won't do this to clothing when there is friction.Because I love the carrier, I am going to try and find a way to cover that pad with another material.Maybe one that is less coarse.Now that I'm taking care of my granddaughter, I was desperately seeking for a similar baby backpack until I found this one.The waist belt is a must for the wearer, for an evenly distribution of the baby's weight, so that your shoulders don't get hurt.My 8 month old son HATED this carrier, sadly.We'd had high hopes based on the reviews.But he didn't seem to feel secure in it.Because of the way the carrier is positioned, he was able to push against my back with his feet and try to stand up, and the unpadded straps holding him into the backpack would cut into his neck and leave horrible marks.We had a difficult time getting him in and out, because the clasp for the straps that secure him are placed very low in the carrier, and the carrier is very narrow, and we couldn't see the release buttons to get him out.We also had a diffult time with the very stiff metal stand -- it's hard to put your kid down when you can't get the stand to release behind you!Finally, the lack of any type of chest or waist strap was a big problem from an ergonomic perspective, and our kid is only 17lbs.I can't imagine have a much heavier one in there.It arrived yesterday, and is being returned in the morning.You get what you pay for, I guess....Toddlers are smarter and stronger than you think).What I don't like is we always always forget to NOT slam our toilet lid down.You must remember to lift up the latch before putting your seat down.It has an array of Velcro and tie straps that we sort out every time, and have to deal with when we fold the stroller, and the only way to really make a shade for our boy is to tie it through the side bars of the stroller, encroaching on his already pretty limited space.It makes keeping him shaded rather a challenge.This thing is, basically, a good concept but not quite adequately executed, if what you're looking for is a replacement canopy and not an extension.I haven't had them in the sun yet, but I know they will keep a lot more sun off my girls than the shades it came with.They were cheaper too.It also helps keep them a little more separated, since from time to time my 14 month old likes to bug my 3 yo.Since we are going to Dollywood in about a month, I couldn't wait 6-8 weeks for these shades, so after a lot of searching, I found them at [...].Everywhere else they were out of stock or backordered.This is the best stroller it not only is a very compact size it holds and supports our baby so well with the shoulder harness.I really wanted to LOVE this stroller.I called and they offered to send a replacement wheel.Perhaps I had not snapped it in enough?I never experienced this before.The only other issue I have is with the length of the straps for the upper part of the five point harness.I expected more from a stroller that claims it has a 50 lb requirement.The reason I sold my Chicco Capri was because of this very reason, the straps were too snug for him.It's also nice and light which is what I needed.I would recommend this to my friends, with a little warning about the wheels.I have been looking for a while for just this stroller.I was looking for something to put in the back of the car for mall and short grocery shopping.Also I didn't want it to look cheap, it needed a sun shade and needed to fit my skinny one year old.Finally, this fits the bill.The stroller was tightly packaged and all the end parts were covered with foam.The 4 sets of wheels were easy to pop on, though I probably should have turned the lights on to see the direction arrow because I ended up putting the first one on upside down.It took me 10 minutes to put together with a toddler crawling all over me and it, which I categorize as a success.Cons: the back is not breathable, so summers might be a little rough with back-sweat.Also, it claims to have recline, and although it does, it probably only reclines about 2 inches at best.I would not get this for that feature, it's pretty lame actually.I got it in all black because I didn't want it to look dirty after a while.The stroller is good for up to 50 pounds, though honestly if my child still wants to be in a stroller when he's 7, we've got issues.Some things to note, it does not recline very far.I mean it barely reclines.It doesn't bother me, my little one sleeps just fine anyway.The stroller doesn't have a cupholder but it has a fabric storage bag that is kinda cool.The shade pops on and off, and I learned that you cannot fold the stroller without it popping off on one side.I am short, 5 ft 2, so it is a good height for me.The hippo print is cute.Much better than a cheapo umbrella stroller!I would have liked a bigger storage area, and hard plastic cupholder.Needed an extra light weight stroller for my husbands car and it's been great.Taller handles so its comfortable for my husband and it's way more durable than the $29 umbrollas.I see I am not the only reviewer having this problem.I was excited when we first took the stroller out of the package because the print is great, the height of the handles is a little better than most umbrella strollers, the canopy is nice and there is a little zipper storage bag and basket big enough for a small diaper bag.However, once I took it outside, the front wheels immediately started shaking every few feet.I tried it on flat indoor floors at the mall and it still shook.I am calling them tomorrow and if they won't replace the wheels, I will be sending this back to Amazon and will never buy anything from First Years again.I absolutely love the little caddy part up by the handles.I am frequently able to avoid even having to carry a diaper bag b/c of this thing.It seems very durable and so easy to steer.The only con I can even begin to think of is that when walking, my feet often hit the wheels.I have to make sure to take smaller steps to avoid this.We do have a very expensive Quinny stroller for our son but that thing also takes up a lot of space in the car, is unhandy and rather heavy.We went looking for a "cheap" umbrella stroller that can easily be stored in a corner, is light and still somewhat good and comfortable.We came across a lot of very cheap and flimsy ones until we spottet the Jet stroller.It is exactly what you should expect when you buy a stroller in this price category.You get a lightweight stroller, folds easy, can be stored in the smallest corner, has a compartment under the seat to conveniently store the diaper bag, has a cup holder, double wheels, adjustable sun cover, 5 point harness and a reclining seat.This was everything I was looking for.It is not remotely as high tech or comfortable as our Quinny stroller but it is light, easy to store and comfortable enough for a day trip to the zoo or the museum.I am sure some people have given this stroller bad ratings but you just don't get a Rolls Royce if you pay for a Hyundai...Good buy(p.s.: you can get this stroller at e-bay for only $39.99 plus $4.99 s&h;)I'm 5'6" and hubby's 5'10'.The seat reclines just enough to keep DSs head from bobbing forward when he falls asleep.Be careful when you install the front wheels...I got them in upside down and they fell off on our first walk!(Didn't come with any instructions.)But it was an easy enough fix.The only change I would make would be for the sun shade to fully tilt foward over the baby for when the sun is low in the sky.Often it doesn't do any good.It fits in the car, easy to fold and unfond, the baby seems comfortable in it at least during short outings.It's a little heavier and larger than I imagined, but I guess it's the payoff for durability and comfort of both the passenger and the stroller-pusher.But it grew on me after a few days.This red Ignite stroller is replacing a Cosmo Combi that I've had for about 2 1/2 yrs as a "store" stroller.I feel it's good as a store umbrella stroller because:1) It does not shake at all unlike my Combi.May not be a problem with a smaller child, but for a 37" child it is.6) There is no cup holder for the kid.I called the company and even though there are no mesh pockets pictured here or on their website, the stroller is supposed to have them so they are sending them to me.I am also able to put my reusable grocery bags around both handles which balances the weight nicely.9) Does not fully recline.So much better than Combi.For serious walks/outings I'll stick with my Tike Tech all terrain stroller.My tall 3.5 year old sat in it and she fits fine.The foot rest could have been made a little lower, so her legs can be more comfortable, but she's fine.I steered it with one hand with my big 3.5 year old in it and it was good.I really wanted a Maclaren, but they're so expensive!It looks great and durable.because of the price difference/description.Unfortunately, the canopy does not adjust (at all) like the one on the Jet version.The description should be changed because it states it has a "fully adjustable canopy"....unless you consider "fully adjustable" the fact that you can open and close it!We have an extremely pale child, so it was one of the major selling points for me.I have the khaki Stroller for about 3 weeks now and its great.I was about to buy Britax Blink Lightweight Stroller, Double Dots which was on sale for $99, but then I saw this stroller in suggestions.I immediately noticed the amount of 4 and 5 star reviews and I thought, I should really look into it.Pros:- comfortable open seat, my kids love to look around and see everything.- handlebar console - parent tray with 1 cup holder and pockets for the keys, cell phones, wallets.Very roomy.- tall handles.They are a bit bigger and because they are made of rubber they do not make as much noise compare to hard wheels that you see on umbrella strollers often.- YOU CAN PUSH AND TURN THIS STROLLER WITH 1 HAND!Pretty lightweight (14 lbs) but it is heavier than the umbrella stroller and therefore a lot sturdier.- this feels a little like all terrain stroller.I had no problem pushing it on a grass field.- love the 5 point harness.Great value for the money!Cons:- I don't really like the cross black metal thing in the back but it does add support so it's ok.- Basket is a bit small and hard to reach.- As in many other umbrella and lightweight strollers, the seat does not recline all the way flat.It still reclines some.I do not need this feature but some people do, so I thought I'd mention it.I can't think of anything else negative about this stroller right now.Wow, I'm impressed with this stroller so far.We've been using it for one week while we're on vacation (so it's getting lots of use).My husband is 6 feet tall and has no problems with the handle length or with kicking the wheels.There is a cup holder near the handles and a handy zippered pouch.The under stroller storage area doesn't look huge but our big diaper bag does fit.I also like the 5-point harness because it helps our 6-month old remain upright.He also had no problem napping in the stroller in the reclined position.I have no trouble navigating tight spaces or bumping into people with this stroller.The inexpensive options were not for me- did not want to hunch over just to push the stroller or have something that reminded me of a toy stroller.The 5 point harness is simple to use.The canopy is OK- not big enough to really offer much protection, but it will work.Well worth the money!The strollers 5 point harness is easy to operate and it's a very comfy ride for your child all in all.A reversible stroller, that can also be used as a snap-n-go for a car seat-- for this price, you can't beat it!Pros:The assembly was super easy.Includes parent console/cupholder and belly bumper bar.Seat sits very upright, which my 10 month old likes a lot.Pushes and handles really well, inside and outdoors.Fabric seems waterproof and very durable (kind of nylon-ish)Of course, the versatility of the seat positions-- front facing, rear facing, and fully reclined, it becomes more like a bassinet.Has leg extender so child's legs don't dangle in the air, more comfortable.Huge basket.Easy to recline, move seat, and fold.Cons:Only comes in gray or red (so far anyway)Handlebar may be a little high for short people.(I'm 5'3" and its manageable).With the seat on, its bulky.Doesn't have a very tall seatback, wouldn't be good for older, tall kids.You are getting a lot for your money, and its great for young babies.I wish it had come out a year ago!We wanted to get a smaller stroller than our jogging stroller and overall we are very happy with this stroller.Also the wheels do get squeeky from time to time, but a little WD40 fixes that.Overall I would probably buy again.I bought this stroller because my 4-month old hates his car seat and hates strollers where he faces away from me.The stroller interior is a dark grey and the hood interior is turquoise.It was very easy to put together- took me under 5 minutes.It only fits Graco car seats- fyi.Cons:-The wheels are fingernails on a chalkboard squeaky and that started about 2 days after receiving the stroller.WD-40 will fix it-but you'll need to apply it weekly.I didn't think the squeak would bother me (after reading other reviews mentioning it) but I mean they have this loud squeak that would wake the neighbors type thing.-The wheels are also very cheap and look very worn after about 5 walks (walks just down the street and back).- The handle bar is too flimsy to hold a diaper bag- but the diaper bag can fit below.-Stinks when it comes out of the box- we had to let it air out for 2 days before use.-Stroller shade is UNBELIEVABLY small/short.I mean it barely covers anything- so if you're out alot during the day you'll need a shade extender or something.Pros:-Stroller looks more expensive then it is.-You can flip the seat to face you (the only way my son will use it) or to face out.-The seat has 3 angles- straight up, kinds reclined, and all the way down.When going to the mall i can fit my wallet, keys, cell phone, lip gloss, tissues, baby wipes, pacifier, and water bottle in the compartments!!!-Bottom storage is large- but since you can't fit your diaper bag on handles you have to use that space below.I find I can fit my diaper bags and 2 small-medium shopping bags.Sorry girls.-Easy to take apart and fold up.It does require that you remove the seat and then fold stroller- so you have two pieces.For the price- you can't go wrong!Just grab some WD-40 and your set.I would recommend this to any mom- especially moms who have fussy car seat babies.Also my son is 4-months, 16 pounds, and 26 inches long- he fits fine.I am admittedly a strollers obsessed person.I am on my fourth baby now and have purchased over 7 strollers over the past 8 years.Update: 2011I used this stroller for about 8 months when the foam on the handle bar ripped (not even sure how).I contacted the company and they had me ship them 2 of the wheels and then they shipped me - for free- a whole new stroller.I was really impressed with this level of customer service.I did decide to sell it at this point and get a single BOB stroller as it fit my needs better at that stage in the game.Pros: The stroller was absolutely great to push the whole 8 months I was using it.The fabric really held up well.I am not due any day with my 4th baby and really miss this stroller :) I just can't justify having it AND my BOB double stroller (which rocks!I LOOOOVED it so much and used it all the time with ease.Cons: The seat was a bit too reclined in my opinion even in the most upright setting.My son seemed to pull himself into a more upright position.Undoing the seat from the frame (chassis) every time I folded it into the car was a annoying.But it was worth it for those first 5 months when he really needed that flat area to sleep.It is quite bulky even when folded.I never invested the time to really figure that out.The storage basket is a bit of a joke.....thank goodness for my skip hop diaper bag.I plan to return to my part time work with my baby and so wanted a comfortable, compact place for him to sleep completely flat.This stroller fits my goal exactly.The first thing out of hubby's mouth (and mine) when we opened the box was "WOW, that looks exactly like that $800 Uppa Baby stroller you wanted!"The hood is a very good size and offers more than 2/3 coverage.I always wish that any stroller will be as good as a BOB stroller's hood size, but we can't have everything :) (LOVE BOB strollers by the way)So for my turning test (because I am still pregnant) I put my 43 lb.I was actually shocked.it did not lean to one side or favor the front or back and it didn't have tough points while turning.I can see putting a small diaper bag in there OR a purse and some loose diapers and a few other small things.For me this is not a huge deal as I have the Skip Hop Duo Deluxe diaper bag and it clips on to the handle bar very sleekly and offers me all the storage (I hope) I need plus I can put my water bottle, keys, etc.I love that bag!!!I bought the "Childress Bottles and Bags stroller organizer with shopping bag hooks" thinking this would be the perfect compliment to this stroller and I don't like it one bit.The "water bottle holders" are a joke unless you drink from a kid sized water bottle and the other pockets I found awkward.Anyway, I am returning it and just plan to use the diaper bag as my "parent organizer."I do consider it a downside that you have to remove the seat in order to fold it into your car.But I also have never seen a stroller that was a bassinet and a toddler seat in one.They also had the grace to include the adapter for a carseat so that your infant carseat will fit right into the metal frame when the seat is removed.Almost every other company that sells high-end strollers makes you purchase that separately.My hats off to them for this.As a mother of almost 3, I know the importance of being able to do this with your stroller so you are not waking your sleeping baby.I only gave it four stars because to me, the 5th star should be reserved for products that you wouldn't want to change or improve.As a last note my other favorite strollers are the Peg Perego Pilko P3 or a BOB for singles, and HANDS DOWN the BOB Dualle for a double.Here's why:1)It does not sit at a full upright "0" degree angle (90*).This was a major factor in my decision.2) Basket.Basket basket.The lack of storage was really annoying and got worse as it went on.3) The footrest is not adjustable.This is sort of a pro/con based on the fact the seat turns into a bassinet, but his little legs stuck straight out when seated and hung over, he was uncomfortable.4) The two part fold.This really didn't bother me that much, but I greatly prefer being able to fold the entire thing together if necessary.5) Fabric.It did repel stains but I wanted something that looked nicer.All in all, I did enjoy the stroller and was quite sad to give up the spin feature.If you're looking to save money, the Wave might be for you.But ultimately, there were some things I still really wanted out of a stroller that the Wave just didn't provide.***EDIT 1/11/11***I've been using this stroller for a few months now.I still really enjoy it.The packing/unpacking of the stroller is quite a breeze now.As another reviewer stated, we've had a little bit of trouble feeling like the right side of the handlebar is just maybe half an inch or so lower than the left.Apparently there is an easy fix so I look forward to that.It is easy to clean, and my six month old likes to sit in it upright as well as sleep in it bassinet mode.I still largely hate the basket.I use it to stash a water bottle and a blanket, and maybe my jacket.I use stroller cruise hooks to attach my diaper bag.If you're debating I'd still recommend you get it.and it has not disappointed.Also, I get a lot of comments of 'that is the coolest stroller I have ever seen' and people asking me where to get it.I spent time in Miami where EVERYONE and their dog has a Bugaboo.There were at least 6 Bugaboos out by the Ritz Carlton pool there, along with my stroller, and even the Bugaboo owners took note!Happy shopping!*If you are looking for a footmuff, go for the JJ Cole bundle me in TODDLER.I also went with the Cruise Hooks to attach on the handle.Those are the two accessories I'd say are a definite must-buy.I'm going to purchase a Meeno babies stroller liner for summer, as well, but can't comment on its fit yet.I'll update later._____________________________________________ORIGINAL REVIEW:I just got this stroller today after lots of research on reversible-seat strollers.My initial impression is very good!Here is a breakdown of what I like and don't like:Like:1) Obviously the stroller looks very nice.2) The spin handle!This is the reason I chose the stroller.3) It was very easy to assemble.It took less than five minutes.4) It handles well due to the large rear tires that always stay in the rear.5) For those that want, it already comes with a car seat adaptor which is nice.My baby hates his car seat, which is the reason I wanted a parent-facing stroller, thus I don't need this part.6) You CAN adjust from bassinet mode to toddler mode and vice versa while the child is in the seat (also not recommended though).Going from bassinet to toddler is easier though, because I wanted to be able to quietly lie the baby down when he fell asleep upright.This is more difficult to do because the seat part drops quickly if you don't support it when you release the buckle.7) Large canopy with peek a boo window (vinyl).This combined with the ability to flip the seat means baby never has to have the sun in his eyes!8) Easy operation: Easy to undo belly bar, easy to undo/place seat, easy to flip, easy to fold.Dislike:1) The stroller fabric isn't quite as nice as I would hope, but I am getting a Meeno liner.I DID manage to hook my large Burberry diaper bag onto the handlebars (I know, it says not to).However, when it is in bassinet mode, it is awkward and the driver is right up against the bag.When the seat is upright in toddler mode, it touches the part where a child's lower leg would be.My baby is only 4 months so that is not an issue now.The two straps that adjust from bassinet mode to toddler mode are a little tough to do, you really have to squat and pull them pretty hard to buckle.I guess that means they're secure...Overall it is the best option for the price considering the bassinet to toddler and the reversible seat.We also have a Chicco Cortina system and that stroller takes up more room in our BMW trunk than this does.It doesn't have a lock when folded, but it stands up so that really isn't a problem for us.As for the velcro and the swinging bar on the underneath side of the stroller: put the seat in bassinet mode.Fasten the two 1" velcro tabs around this bar.Then take the large velcro closure that runs the width of the stroller and fasten it around the previous bar you just velcroed.We will stick to the Chicco when we need more storage space (i.e.going to Disney World, need a big shopping basket).I contacted Amazon and as long as the product hasn't been used you can return it within 365 days.So, you can take it out, put it together, try it in your home and if you don't like it, you can return it for free, shipping included.Update 4.21.11: seems like it's best for small babies that can take advantage of the bassinet and reversible handle option.She likes to sit up and look around, but somehow in the Wave she was always somewhat reclined and couldn't see far enough.I pulled up the seat to the max and even put a blanket behind her but she still screamed.Bottom line: if you are still pregnant or just had a baby, get the stroller.If the baby is older than 6 months, there are better options out there.I have been using the stroller for 4 months now and still love it.I agree with other reviewers regarding lack of accessories and small bag space, but for my circumstances it's not an issue since we don't take long enough walks to have to tag along bottles and diaper bags and what I do bring fits fine in the basket.I did get a universal caddy for the handle where I can fit a water bottle, keys, and wallet.My daughter is very sensitive to sun, so as soon as I see her squint, I just rotate the seat to make her comfortable, same for if she's had enough of me and wants to see something else  :) I first got a cute Graco stroller with the whole infant seat attachment gig, but my baby looked so uncomfortable and hot and could never take a nap.She started taking naps in this one when I got it.My daughter is only 5 months old now, so we are using a semi-reclined toddler seat now and I can't comment on how she will fit in the stroller a year from now, but I'm hoping we will get to use it until she's two.The only "con" if you can call it that is that it is bulky and you have to take off the seat to fold it, but we can live with that since it offers so many other cool features.As for the other reviewer commenting about the smell, most baby things we bought smelled and we had to air them out.I didn't have any more of a smell issue with the stroller as I did with everything else and there is absolutely no smell right now.My partner can smell anything a mile away and he hasn't complained.Its so much nicer than i even imagined!I'll update this review once my baby is born.I haven't been able to use it for real yet, I've just played with it around the house.------------------------Most of the negative comments about this stroller have to do with:1.Bouncy seat3.Seat needs to be removed in order to fold the stroller1.The handle is what is used to flip the seat around, and after the flip, the handle bar is reversed!Can you imagine some sleep deprived parent with hot coffee in a built-in stationary cup holder going to turn their baby around?Also, babies like to be bounced a little anyway.Yes, the seat does need to be removed.I look on the bright side: removing the seat splits up the weight and allows for greater flexibility when transporting the stroller (seat can go in the backseat if needed for example).Overall I think it's a fabulous product.I also love the huge sun shade!I think if you read all the reviews you will have a good idea of what to expect from this stroller and you will buy it for all the positive features of this stroller for the price.(Price does vary - I've seen it go from $280 down to $225 on Amazon)My baby was only 8 weeks old when he first rolled out of this pillow.We have the boppy (nursing pillow) and use it to prop him up from time to time, but wanted this for safety.I still use it on the floor when I'm right there and he enjoys it for a short time.We even used it for her to sleep between us the first few nights when we couldn't stop staring at her...she is so comfortable in this she often falls right asleep.I know it says not to sleep in it but until she is mobile it seems safe enough.Unfortunately we learned that she also has reflex and is prone to spitting up after she eats.This is made worse if you set her in any sitting position; bouncy seat, swing, carseat.This works like a charm as she is more reclined and doesn't spit up when we lay her in it.I would also suggest the cover that you can purchase for this as well.I was afraid the cover may not be very soft since it was meant to be under another cover but it's very soft and can be used by itself.It's a great cover for the price!great product, pretty self explanatory.It's quite thin and fits the boppy very snugly, doesn't bulk it up at all which is great.I recommend this product!Product is definately water resistant.I only purchased this slipcover for my boppy as I found it was not necissary to buy an additional cotton cover.The sippy spout is good unless you're sucking very hard - then it seems to kinda collapse and also baby got some air bubbles and was hiccuping.I do like that the spout interchangeable with ThinkBaby - we have those and I'll give those a try as well.Overall I prefer glass (more inert), however this stainless is better for travel and lighter for baby to hold up than glass.I have quite a few healthy drink holder options at home for him for different scenarios and needs.This a good option.Not HG though.... sigh.Sunlight breaks down vitamin c and other nutrients in milk, so it is great to not have to put a cover on the bottles like I did with the glass.The reason I didn't give it above 4 stars:1.They currently do not come with sealing discs.I  wish that I could pump directly into them rather than transferring (exposure to air also causes oxidation of vitamin c in milk).They say they are coming out with an adapter soon.It may be too late for me unfortunately!3.I had to buy other nipples as well.I stuck to newborn vented nipples --- think baby nipples, mam vented, and coddlelife classic vented all work well.I think my daughter likes the mam nipples best.BUT that was more cash I had to shell out on top of the price of the bottle.-------Edit 3 years later.1.These have held up well as I am using them with my 2nd baby - with the exception of the paint!!!Almost all the paint has chipped off after 3 years of hard use.I have started to try to manually chip the paint off the others after a run in the dishwasher.Stick to the non-painted ones for long term use.To be fair, this is also the case with our Kleen kanteen bottles.I guess it's just not good to put painted steel in the dishwasher.2.They now sell their own sealing disks, but they are much more expensive than the avent ones.I can't imagine how I functioned without it.I really recommend paying the money for benefit.Plus, I figure I can resell and get some money back when I'm done with it.All my friends with babies find this appealing too!Honestly, I don't know why people still mess around with those silly pads.This thing is small, portable, easy to use.Never had a false positive after a month of use.Love the product!We chose this one over the regular snuza because of the ability to adjust the time of the alarm (15, 18, or 20 seconds) and because of the ability to replace the battery.These factors combined with the fact that he sleeps in multiple places (making an under-mattress monitor useless) made the snuza a great choice for us.We can use it whether he is sleeping in bed with us, in his crib, in his bouncy seat, or even in his carseat.I highly recommend this product!*NOTE*We used this until our son turned about 9 months old, at which time he became to squirmy.The Snuza simply would not stay on the diaper anymore at that point.Though we still recommend it to others, I was extremely disappointed with the battery life.It lasted nowhere near a year and, based off of local stores who sell it, this is a common problem that they often hear from their customers, as well.My daughter was born prematurely and was on oxygen until she was 9 weeks old.She wears this monitor EVERY night!It lets me sleep so much better knowing that if she were to stop breathing the monitor would alarm and I could immediately intervene.I haven't had any problems with false alarms.Great product, I would recommend it to anyone!This battery was supposed to last 1 year but it ended up only lasting for about 3 months!Very disappointed...Expecting our first child, we purchased this carseat after reading numerous reviews of many different brands and styles.The seat arrived promptly, looked great and I am sure it will function very well.However, two major points:1.I would highly advise, if possible, to get a measurement on how it will fit in your car.Not good for mom and dad to drive together with baby in the back.2.While the instructions are fairly straight forward, I quote to you from p.37 of the instruction manual: "Step#13: Ensure the angle indicator ball is the green with to keep the child's airway open."How can a reputable company print something like this?Granted my baby most likely won't be naked in it, but he will be warm and in as little clothing as possible during our California summers.2a) The removable back/seat padding piece is kind of hokey.It has open teeth for the straps to fit into but it looks like it would get folded up weird and maybe get frustrating for both myself and the child.2b) The aforementioned pad covers up a square cut-out in the seat cover that would collect crap.It seems like having the extra padding is a must just to keep the hole covered up and that it would be uncomfortable for chubby legs to be rubbing up on the hole if it weren't covered up.3) There is no head padding for an infant.Has no metal frame in it.The E brand's seat does have a metal frame.6) The main fabric is attached to the seat with snaps.Also, elastic loops are so much easier to fix/repair/replace on your own.7) The manual doesn't say how the level is supposed to read for correct installation.I assume that for rear facing the ball is supposed to be in the Green zone with the 2's and for front facing it's supposed to be in the yellow with the 1's?Or maybe it's always supposed to be in the Green.Fully 'reclined' rear facing, the passenger seat can still sit back almost all the way back.If the passenger seat is pulled up a bit it could even be slightly reclined and not hit the car seat.The padding doesn't seem like it would be that great for a baby.Just looks uncomfortable.All the 'no thread' features just look hokey, and there are a ton of crumb and muck catchers on this seat.And just like with the non-premier models once the seat is forward facing and you remove the extra padding there's a huge gaping hole at the crotch...that's going to be gross and uncomfortable.I would rather take 5 minutes out of my day to re-thread the crotch strap than to spend longer than that trying to clean it or sewing up a cover for the hole.I just really have a hard time buying that this seat is better than a more conventional model that has a smarter, mom friendlier, mess resistant design.Pluses: The fabric is really nice and soft.It fits in our Prius.Maybe the Sunshine will be 'the one'.If not, I'll keep the baby in the infant seat as long as I can and just get a forward facing chair.I bought this car seat 2 months back.Knowing is rated as one of the safest car seats it makes me feel even better.I would recommend the car seat to anybody from newborn to toddler.The anti-rebound bar is a great safety feature.I like the anti-rebound bar on this car seat better than the tether on the radian xtsl.Cons: probably not very easy to travel with, sometimes have a hard time reaching the strap tightening slot.The colors, squeaker, contrast, mirror, and taggies!When the dog got a hold of it and chewed it apart we quickly ordered another.Great toy!Great product!We have had it tied up in her crib since she was about 3 months old... she plays with it every morning....we just hear the bells on the racoon and know she is awake.She is now 11 months old and still very interested in it.Only thing I wish was that there were ties on both top and bottom.My newborn lies on her back and stares at this book, keeping her content for good stretches of time.I also prop it in front of her during tummy time and she lifts her head to look at the shapes and to hear the sounds -- a great distraction during an activity that many infants do not enjoy.Turns out she is more interested in the animal side.She loves it so much, would recommend this for others.Also, it is machine washable which is always a plus and easy to take along with you where ever you go.Messy and difficult to dump the water when done.The rack has 2 usable levels.Bottom level for bottle; top level for nipples and caps.When it is complete, water accumulate on the bottom rack and base unit.So you have to dump the water on the bottom rack (usually half of this water end up on my kitchen countertop when I do this).Then you have to dump the water that accumulate on the base unit.Note to manufacturer: Make some holes on the bottom rack so the water drops down to the base unit; so water only collects in 1 place and I can clean up in 1 step.The unit is designed with 3 levels, which only works with all  small parts.You cannot use 3 levels with bottles.And it is difficult to add/remove this 3rd level.I wanted a different warmer but this was available at the store and I liked the reservoir and the flexible options.It worked really well for about 2 months.We are scared to use it now.Pro's flexible, water reservoir is a plusCon's leaks, loud beepingThe buttons are self explanatory and it heats the formula quickly.There is no need to refill water everytime you use it, just once in awhile.You do have to play around to find the best settings but after that, you just press one button.The only thing that is problematic is that the beeping is very loud, although there is an option to turn it off.I leave it on so I can know when it's done when I'm in another room.My daughter has learned what the beeping means and gets excited when she hears it!CONS -+ Volume: like others have said, the beep is almost as loud as a fire alarm, and lasts a bit long for my tastes, but its nice that I can hear it from another room+ Time: It feels like this warmer takes forever, which isn't a problem when you can distract the baby in another room, but feels like hours when you've got a screaming child in your hands - there are a number of times that I have given up and taken it out mid-warming cycle because I couldn't wait any longer+ Quality of Heating: It did a GREAT job with small volumes of formula/breastmilk (I did both), but doesn't seem to do as great of a job with larger volumesIt was inconvenient because I had to refill the vial everytime.Here are the pros and cons:Pro:1) The heating is very even and heats slowly rather than steaming the milk scorching hot very fast.With the other warmer, I had to constantly shake the milk to make sure the heat was distributed evently.2) Not having to refill the vial each time.Con:1)I move the warmer upstairs in the evening, so everytime I plug it in to the electrical outlet, the previous setting is lost, including the beeper deactivation.So now I just let it beep, which is kind of loud.I wish there can be a permanent setting for this so I don't have to deactivate the beeper everytime I plug it in.2) I think in order for this warmer to work effectively, the water level is suppose to be below the basket (which means the water never touches the milk bottle but rather just use the steam heat to heat the bottle).This is not a problem if you don't move the unit excessively.But I notice that everytime I move the unit between upstairs and downstairs, the motion would cause more water to go into the warmer, which creates ineffective heating the next time I heat the milk.To fix this, I have to pour out the excess water and reload the water reservior after I move the unit.Overall, I would recommend this product if you don't plan on moving it around a lot.You'd have better luck steaming the veggies by just blowing hot air on them.This poorly designed, overly complex, expensive waste of plastic comes with the base, four plastic bowls, two lids and the blade.It requires three of the specially-designed bowls to be stacked in a certain order with only one of the two tops fitting on for the steaming process.The blender is probably the worst I've ever seen, which is saying something since I've bought the cheapest on the market.This is an utter waste of money, time, and packaging materials.I returned mine as quickly as possible.Believe me, convenient though this concept is, it is anything but.when I first got mine out to use it I thought it was broken because the steamer light wouldn't stay on.Then I looked up FAQ's on learning curve's website and the container that does not have holes in the bottom that looks like it is supposed to hold water is not where you put the water.When I was searching online I found a lot of people had this problem, the directions are not very clear.However, the price has jumped for some reason after I purchased mine and I don't know if I would buy one now.As an older mother-to-be, I prepared myself for a high risk pregnancy and tried to foresee any difficulties my baby might encounter.I plan to purchase a more expensive Angelcare monitor that alerts when the baby does not move.I was interested in also getting a less expensive monitor model for when the baby visits its grandparents and naps.The first time I plugged it in, I was upset that it didn't work, but that was operator error!Sure enough - the instructions warn the user NOT to do what I did!I chose to use the AC adapter because the battery compartment is difficult to take apart.There is a small screw that has to be removed placed under two clips.That seems like a poor design.Not expecting much, I then tested the monitor by listening in the next room.No problem!The sounds were picked up easily and I could hear very well.It no longer worked when I tested it the full width of our home.I have to admit, it worked better than I expected, but for those with the nursery a distance from the parent monitor, like in home where the master bedroom is on one side of the house and the baby's room is on the other or on another floor, a different monitor would be recommended.I was not impressed enough by this monitor to cancel my plans to buy a better, but do feel secure that it will do its job well enough for taking on trips.This digital monitor is a great idea, but unfortunately the execution of the idea needs improvement.Like many others who gave the monitor a low starred reviewed, I too had problems with reception.Sometimes it was so poor that I had no idea what was going on with the baby in the other room.The receiving end (my monitor) often had a lot of static and blank moments in the reception.There were times when I could hear the baby crying through the doorway of the room I had the receiver located, but the receiver barely seemed to pick up the cries when the baby's monitor was located right next to the crib.I do like the design and don't mind the bright light of the LED, but the fact that the unit was an unreliable monitor makes it a one star.If the baby had started to choke I would have been unable to hear any warning signs if the receiver was in its static mode or was blanking in and out.I don't use this very much since I live in a small house but it does work for when I am working in the yard while my little one takes a nap.I have been using it for 6 months with no problems.We purchased our unit from Target and I thought I'd share our experience with this unit for other Amazon folks.Due to us misreading the labeling on the packaging, we believed it had a rechargeable battery, much like the Sony we were replacing.Instead we discovered it needed straight up AAs.I'd estimate two AAs every three days.It reduces the portability, but we don't eat through batteries anymore.My biggest complaint though is the snapping and popping noises the parental unit emits.People complain about the blue light in their darkened rooms which I just don't find it that bad.But the popping and clicking noises are enough to drive you mental.I feel like we are listening to aliens speak, like in the movie "Signs".We find the general volume of the monitor to be adequate when not listening to pops and clicks.Compare this all to our newer Safety First baby monitor bought for our second child, which was FAR cheaper, rechargeable, ample volume, and has zero popping.I simply can't recommend this First Years product to anyone.We registered for this monitor, and got it at our first shower.Thankfully, I set it up and tested it before throwing the box out, because it was horrible!The reception wasn't clear at all, and the volume is really low.The difference was unbelievable!I got this monitor because our old one was horrible.It made high-pitched sounds when I held it, made buzzing sounds depending on the weather and sometimes, we got interference and could hear our neighbor's baby wailing.(This happened one night when they baby was let to "cry it out.")So I thought that no matter what, this new monitor would surely be better.I was wrong.Can you believe I am actually switching back to using my old one?Oh where to begin?Okay, I should start with the one good thing going for it: I never heard my neighbor's kid.So I guess it isn't *that* horrible but still.If possible, the range was worse than my old one even though this is digital and 2.45ghz while my old one was 45mhz.I had to set up the parent unit right outside my toddler's door in order for it get a signal and when it was farther away, it made high-pitched sounds that was akin to nails scratching a blackboard.When it did work the sound was not very loud, even on its highest setting.My old one was LOUD, I could hear my child from across the house.I could even hear my kid breathing on the old one but with this one, he could be crying full blare and it's not that much louder than what I could hear without a monitor at all.Another pet peeve was how the light kept blinking on the child unit.I guess it is supposed to indicate whether or not the parent unit was in range, but even when the parent unit was close by that light kept blinking and distracting my little one who was so curious as to what this blinking light was that he wouldn't go to sleep.Save your money, pass on this one.This is good for older kids in a playroom, not a baby.Also if you place this 3 rooms away, it does not work that well.Clarity isn't nearly as good as we've had with slightly more expensive monitors in the past, but it's not terrible as I've read in some other reviews.Also, there really is no reason they shouldn't have included a rechargeable battery.This thing does eat through batteries like nothing (about every 10 days) if you don't have it constantly plugged in instead.Other than those issues, it seems to be functional, and we've never had any major issues with it malfunctioning.Still, you may be able to find a better monitor at around the same price range.Several reviewers have complained that they could not hear the child.I found that if the unit is close to the child, then you could hear well.The sound-light indicators, out-of-range indicator, low-battery indicator, volume control, battery and plug-in options are useful, but if you are looking for remote control and other digital options, then this unit may not be for you.1.Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby CameraI like lights on my baby monitors, but this isn't your normal light...it's like a darn flashlight that alluminates the entire room like a TV is on...yes, it is that bright!That alone makes me want to throw it away, yet I find myself compelled to tell you all about the other bad features....Reception...It is just OK.I think it is switching channels when it does this, but in the middle of the night it will just start beeping (the parent unit)...unsure why, but it beeps and it beeps loud!This only lasts a few seconds, but enough to make you wake up and pee your pants because you think something is wrong.I have 3 kids and have a monitor in each of their rooms...that's 3 baby monitors on my nightstand at night.I have been using the Sony Baby Call monitor for each of them for years and have had no problems at all, except if my cell phone is set next to the parent unit (every 5 minutes when my cell connects to my email for updates, it messes up the monitor)...therefore I can't put my phone near the monitors, but that is acceptable to me for the quality of the Sony monitors.I will give this POS credit, it doesn't mess up with my cell phone right next to it...but that is probably the last compliment I will give it.It can barely handle transmitting through 3 walls in my house on a single floor...quite pathetic for technology these days.The Child Unit...I do like how this unit looks, it is all sleek, thin, and shiny-white like a Cisco router (if you have seen one and see this in person you are going to think the same thing!!hehe).First thing, why couldn't they put a rechargable battery in this unit??My Sony has it and I feel lost without it here.For an extra 3 cents, they could have made a huge upgrade to this....but no, you have to use standard alkaline batteries if it isn't plugged in.I've had this for a little over a week and already had to change the batteries, another unacceptable thing.I put masking tape over it to try and dim it a bit, which worked...but I shouldn't have had to "rig" it to get a peaceful night sleep.It also has this flip-out stand for when you have it on a table...yet again, it was designed by a moron and if you sneeze, it falls over...another useless feature.!The sound quality on this thing is horrible.My daughter can sit a foot from the child unit and sing a song and I can hold the parent unit inches from me with the volume on high, and I can barely make out the words she is saying.The volume is loud, yes...but it is 99% dead-air noise rather than her voice.TRASHED!Well for starters you can't count on it working (not exactly something you want to say about a monitor), and when it does work, it does such a poor job that you end up getting a headache trying to hear through the soft volume and overwhelming array of static.It's worse than a drive through speaker from the 80s.You do get a reprieve, when it stops working altogether and offers silence, but that kinda defeats the purpose of it!Then there's the loud beeping sound, at least that covered up my cursing at the unit.Anyway, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!I got this for a co-worker who recently had a baby.I don't know why there are so many negative reviews of this product based on what my co-worker reported.It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a more high end baby monitor, but it does exactly what it's supposed to...and that is to alert the parents of the child's noises while sleeping.The price is right and if you want a more "blinged out" baby monitor go ahead and spend the extra cash...but there's really no need as this monitor is more than adequate.As of mother of 3, I have been through several baby monitors.First the Graco sight and sound monitors, then Summer Infant's video monitor and have since been given this monitor by "The First Years" to evaluate.I feel bad, I really do.When given things to evaluate through the Vine program I really love to try to pick out a few positives.Ok, that's enough now on to the irritants associated with this little torture device.1000 feet of reception - no.Crystal clear sound - no.Battery life - epic fail.Plan to keep parent unit plugged in unless for short outings.I have since given this review time to settle in my mind a bit and have decided to come back and add more.First, I added a star to my 2 star review and the reason is simply that this product worked better when I brought it to my parent's house as a back up monitor for the weekend.Another wireless monitor.2 cell phones.3 laptops with WI-FI antanna.I also have a 3 story colonial vs grandma's ranch home.Still, to put in perspective all those other items at my home work just FINE together...Although I have found cause to slightly modify the prior review and rating I still cannot find any cause to recommend this particular monitor over the others (Graco Sight N Sound, Summer Infant Night and Day Video) that have served me so faithfully over the past 7 :) years now.This is the only digital baby monitor that I have used other than the Philips DECT.So far in my 2 weeks of usage - I find this to be pretty decent  Baby monitor- Price is right\- Quality of child unit - good quality mic, but does not compare to Philips- Parent unit does not have battery backup - what if the power goes off- No 2 way communication - there is no way to communicate back to your babyHaving used only one other monitor, this review will be a sort of comparison between the two.The other monitor is the Philips Avent Baby Monitor with DECT technology http://www.amazon.com/Philips-Avent-Basic-Monitor-Technology/dp/B001COIH3A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=baby-products&qid;=1278522722&sr;=8-1.However, I had to stop using it because of the clicking issue.Pros:-2 parent units in case parents are in different areas, so one doesn't have to be the go-to person all the time-good range--about a half block, which is equivalent to the Philips monitor I mentioned above-slim size and belt loop/stand-no sound when pressing buttons--drawback to the Philips monitorCons:-power connection on the parent unit sometimes flashes even after a full 8 hours of charging--the book does not mention that this light should flash--it stays on if it needs charging, so the steady flashing light is a mystery (the batteries are solid in their case)-sound sometimes cuts out on the parent unit--kind of like when you're on a cell and the sound cuts out, except this isn't during the 3-way communication, it just cuts out-charge on the parent units is variable--sometimes after 8 hours of charging, it goes out after 45 minutes, sometimes last several hours-no complete charge indicator, so you just charge it for the 8 hours--it's nice to have a complete charge indicator (green battery light, etc.We're too far down the hall to hear our daughter unless she's absolutely screaming, so we want a parent unit in the bedroom at night.Overall, this unit is a good unit, but the idiosyncracies are irritating.But just in case color matters to anyone, mine was grey.We have a smaller home, so reception was not a problem at all.I appreciate that when you about to lose reception there is a tone to let you know.Be sure to remove your parent unit when going into the room with the baby's unit, or else you'll end up with a loud feedback sound (not good if your little one is sleeping).Overall a good baby monitor for a small home.There are two parent units (walkie talkie type devices) that facilitate communication.They can attach to your clothing or convert to a somewhat shaky easel.Sound quality is acceptable, ie you can hear the other person fairly clearly but an iphone it ain't.There is a night light sensor on the base unit that is in the monitored one's The range is pretty good and the batteries are rechargeable.I have not yet encountered the problems other reviewers have described.I have used this device on in two different settings.The first was while subbing for a friend who is caring for an elderly relative.However she is never comfortable,either too hot or too cold.She always wants really cold things to drink and her room is situated at the opposite end of a large ranch.She sometimes falls out of bed.The monitor worked well  and provided some respite in a situation where the caregiver does not have to be there every single minute.These second situation was a two story home where we were monitoring some newly born puppies.Again, I experienced no feedback and the device worked well.I liked this device and think its uses should not be limited to just baby monitoring.It is something that caretakers of the elderly, sick children and pets would find useful.The only down side to these monitors is that it doesn't seem to have a very long range.I can't take even take it out my front door, less than 50 feet from the baby.The glowing lights on the monitors, and the short (if rechargable) battery life are all cons.The portability is great, and being able to clip it to my belt is a huge plus.The negatives are not necessarily too much to avoid this product, but be aware of its limitations when you purchase it.With three children, 4, 2, and 0, we love having the two monitors.The P400 is a top of the line baby monitor--we are grandparents and use this for visiting family.The two listening units make it very convenient to monitor our grandson from different levels of the house without having to carry the unit around from room to room.Yes, I know this is being marketed to folks with babies, but its appeal is much, much bigger.Have a friend who was critically injured in an auto accident and when she came home I was interested in this unit for her since she will be in a hospital bed for weeks or months, and the bedroom is in a different area of the house.This means someone has to check on her every fifteen or so minutes to see if she needs anything.Lets you know when you are out of range and wearing the parent unit.Again I recommend this for more than just babies.This monitor system is a significant step up from the older monitors that were around when my kids were babies and now that we are caring for elderly parents we again have a need for this type of system.With our first child, my wife and I went through 3 different baby monitor brands before we finally found an acceptable model--a Sony that we use presently.However, we tried out the monitor right away to ensure that it meets our expectations.First of all, we live in a 3-story home, and our son's room is on the top floor.We wanted a monitor that would have clear reception on both of the lower floors--no crackling, static, or other annoying noises, like we have gotten with other monitors.The sound coming out of the roving monitors clipped to our belts was crystal clear--as if we were standing in our son's room.Very impressive!In addition to the #1 priority of clear reception 1 or 2 floor away, we wanted a monitor with plug-in recharge options for all 3 pieces--the stationary monitor in the nursery and the 2 roving monitors.This unit comes with all 3 plug-in options (actually, the stationary monitor is always plugged in, which is typical).Surprisingly, we have found the communication between the roving monitors to be pretty neat.We can speak with one another in different parts of the house with these monitors.For those who want to terrorize your kids with exorcist-like ramblings, proceed at your own risk.The only drawback we have found is the limited battery life of the roving monitors.By this, I can honestly say that the monitors would not make it through the night unplugged.We do not use the monitors at night, but we would plug them in if we did.We have found ourselves charging the roving monitors daily, due to their limited life.In summary, these are nice baby monitors that I would recommend to any parent or prospective parent.We know from experience that there is a lot of junk out there on the market, and these are the best we have tried out of 4 total models from 4 different manufacturers.I got this baby monitor for when I am babysitting for my grandson.I love the fact that there are two parent monitors, so if I'm busy, I can just have my son use one while he is inside the house.I especially love the fact that I can speak to my grandson if he is just waking up and I'm not able to go right into the room.I also love the fact that it automatically sets to the right channel, so you don't have to sit there and try to find the best channel.There isn't anything I really dislike about this baby monitor, it is a big difference from the one that I used when my kids were babies, so I give this two thumbs up!It was not as clear as our DECT monitor, but still pretty clear.The features that need improving or are missing: the belt clip could be a little stronger  or tighter, the rechargeable monitoring parts have weak battery life.It barely lasted overnight.This is not good when you might need it again and again throughout the day for naps.Yes, you can charge it, but what if you forget?Finally, there is no charge indicator light on these parts.You plug it in and guess as to when it might be fully charged.Overall, these are decent monitors and the features are great.It is good enough for a 4 star rating from me, but not five.I really liked this option of this product.I also liked that the sound was very clear and there was little static like the old types of baby monitors.However, there were a couple things I disliked about the product.The range was very short.I left one parent unit in our master bedroom, and the the child unit 3 rooms away down the hall.Both units stayed stationary the entire time.The signal was there most of the times so I could clearly hear from the child unit.The problem w/ loosing the signal was that you would keep hearing a ringing tone from the unit.Once you heard the ringing tone, no matter what you did the units wouldn't synch up again.You would have to turn off and on the parent unit to synch up again.In addition, another negative thing about the product was the feed back.If you walked near the child unit w/ a mobile parent unit, you would get a loud feedback.So you have to remember to turn off the parent unit.Overall, it's a good product, but the range is actually a lot shorter than my 6 year old bulky Fisher Price baby monitor that I can reach anywhere in the house.Whereas, this First Years one was intermittent w/ only half of my house.I also didn't get feedback when I walked near the child unit on my old monitor as well.Thought this product will serve the dual purpose of monitoring our baby (due in a couple of months), and to talk to my wife when we are working in opposite ends of the house, without having to run back and forth.We tested this product during the baby shower, and here is what we found:PROS:- When we were in range, we could hear the child unit quite clearly.- Ability to communicate between the parent units, or just parent/child.- Night lightCONS:- The communication range between the two parent units was quite short.My wife was in the back-yard while I was upstairs, at the front of the house.We couldn't hear each other until we were about 60 feet apart.Our house is not that big, so that's a little disappointing.- Another thing to note is you have to remember to turn off your parent unit when you walk near the baby (or rather the base child unit), or the feedback between the two units will result in a high pitch screech that will guarantee to wake up your baby and everyone else in the house.- Long charge requirements and no indicator when the unit is fully charged!I would hate for the unit to run out of batteries when the baby needs us most!Based on what was advertised, I was excited in what this product had to offer.Unfortunately this unit did not live up to my expectations, and my hunt for a better baby monitor continues.I have just ordered theGraco Ultra Clear II 49MHZ Baby Monitorbased on the positive reviews it has received, so hopefully that will deliver the results I would expect at half the price.My husband and I use this monitor in a 3000 sq.ft, 2-story house.The baby's nursery is upstairs, and the monitors work well all over the house, including on the front porch and in the garage.I still use a monitor for my 6yr old (Philips Avent Digital Screen Baby Monitor with DECT Technologywhich offers the ability to talk back to her (the main reason I got it) since she can now call me if she needs me in the middle of the night and I can respond with out having to get out of bed and she can communicate with me easily if she's playing in her room and I'm busy in the basement etc.I highly recommend that monitor but for our baby I wanted something different (plus this one is cheaper).The cincher for me with this model was the ability to communicate via walkie talkie style with the other parent unit.... my husband and I tested it out and it works great, I can be upstairs and him downstairs both of us with the monitors turned on to hear our infant, then if I need to take a shower etc I can connect to him and ask him to please attend to the baby if she cries as I'll be busy (also great for harassing him to get me something I might need LOL) While this will remain packed away for awhile until I'm ready to stop using the angelcare monitor I know it'll be a perfect addition to our monitor collection when the time comes.We live in a two story home and the main monitor is upstairs and we use the parent monitors throughout the home and even outside on the deck or in the garage.There is nothing more convenient than being able to talk to your partner without shouting with the sleeping baby near.My favorite points about this monitor are that there are different push-to-talk buttons on parent monitors, "parent only" or "child / parent".There is a stand to prop up parent monitor on a countertop and it has a very lightwieght belt clip on parent monitor works great.I can see myself placing the main monitor in the living room once we hit "todlerhood" to be able to discreetly monitor that he is playing safely while I do chores in other areas of our house.I've looked all over the market and not been able to find a monitor that boasts all the features of this one.I saw some of the other reviews prior to receiving this product and noticed complaints about static and poor range but I didn't notice any of these things.I put the main unit in my son's room to give it a test run.My husband stayed in the room while my 5-year-old and I wandered around the house and yard seeing how far we could go.It wasn't amazing, but it wasn't any worse than any other monitor we've had.I was able to go down the driveway and get the mail and go to the garage without losing the signal.I was getting some static at that point but I could still hear everything he said and he could hear me and I decided that was far enough.Again, not really any different from any other monitor I've had.On another note, I quickly noticed that the box claimed the monitor was eco friendly.But I was very pleased to find that the set came with two rechargeable batteries and three adapters.The main unit does not include a battery but has the option of using batteries, though this unit will probably always remain in the baby's room unless you're traveling or visiting family, etc.The other two units have the batteries and this allows you full reign of your house without feeling tied to a specific room where the monitor may be.I know the idea of batteries isn't a new idea with monitors, but even with batteries, the unit is usually so bulky that you're not going to be carrying it around with you from room to room.I can hear baby and she can hear me.I push the button that goes only to the main unit in her room, and she can hear me telling her I'm on my way.I've noticed a huge difference in her behavior and she's much calmer as she waits, rather than wailing until she sees me come through the door.I don't have to get up and run across the house to ask him to check on her.the headunit would turn off and on, didnt matter if on batter or house power.youd have to kinda smack it for it to work right.and one of the hand sets battery just wouldnt charge anymore.no idea why.out of box, wouldnt synch up correctly.it was static and hard to hear.i checked to make sure the battery was plugged in and it was.i even swapped batteries from other handset and it still happened.so one handset DEAD right outta the box.everything is plugged in correctly.just go get something else.its a bunch of junk and my wife freaked when we were sleeping and we found out the baby parent unit turned off in the middle of the night.(that was the first of the sets)Any electronic device can fail and no manufacturer can guarantee that every device they make will work perfectly.In other words, this device, or any other, does not replace a parent physically checking on their child.Rather than echo many other reviews about the product features, when dealing with a child's safety, it is more important, in my humble opinion, to discuss the constraints of such a product.As mentioned above, hopefully, the product works as advertised - but there can be no guarantee of that.I had no problem with the one that I had - it worked perfectly.Still, batteries fail, electronics fail, and numerous other problems can occur.If the product does nothing else but provide a secondary source of information about what is going on with your child, while you are the primary source, it may be a very helpful device for parents who are concerned about minute-by-minute welfare of their children.UPDATE:  After three months, one of the parent units stopped working.All the lights came on and no sound registered.When I contacted the customer service, I was told that the unit was defective and to contact the store from which it was purchased for a refund/exchange.After six months, I am fed up with this monitor.We have to hide the parent unit under the bed, and it still lights up the room.I definitely do NOT recommend this monitor.Initial review:  We've been using the monitor for about a month now, and it seems to work well.We haven't noticed any interference.Our old Sony monitor had channels, which this one does not have, but it doesn't seem to need them.We've even used the parent unit in the same room as the old Sony parent unit without a problem(one monitor in each child's bedroom).The parent units are nice and slim with a handy clip.The monitor does have a bright blue light that blinks when the parent unit is not turned on, which seems a little annoying for the child, so the monitor is better placed out of sight in the child's room.When the battery runs out of charge on the parent units, the only indicator is a light that turns red, so if the battery runs out in the middle of the night, you would never know.My old Sony monitor made a beeping sound when the battery was running out.While it was annoying to be awoken by the beeping noise, at least we knew when the monitor was about to stop working.It doesn't seem to pick up sound quite as well as our old unit in which we could hear baby breathing from several feet away.With first child, I wanted to hear every breath.The plaster walls have been known to cause some problems (funky wi-fi dead spots and such) but haven't been a problem with the monitors.No interference problems with any other electronic devices (or neighbors).I like the design/look of the products, compared with other monitors.Other reviewers have given very detailed descriptions of this product, so I won't repeat information that is already available.I will say, though, that I like this monitor a lot.The construction of the product is attractive and durable.I was surprised by how often we had to charge the monitor, but it wasn't too inconvenient.Overall, I would recommend this product, especially if you are looking for a monitor that offers two-way communication.I'm with those who doesn't like the fact that that power button is on the side of the parent unit as I turned it off several times without thinking about it.These are sure better than when they first came out with these thingsThe idea of having two parent units is priceless  Both parents can have one with them at all timesYou can communicate with each other and the baby the rechargeable batteries are for the parent units you have to buy the 3 aaa nursery batteries for temporary useThere is a sweet little night light that is a hand activated sensor and you can manually shut it off  There is an indicator that shows when monitors are connected to each other, so no guessingThere is also a sound light  for when the baby makes sounds You have a headphone jack and belt clip for wearing Andthere is an alert when you are out of range, and a parent finder..so far so GOOD!This is my first baby monitor, so I cannot compare to others.The two parent's units not only make it easy for both of us to keep track of things, but I find it easier to keep one each in the kitchen and LR, instead of carrying it everywhere.I haven't had any issues with static, and I can hear clearly from all parts of the house.Each unit has a charge cord which I find helpful.I have been using this for about a week and it works with no problem.We put the main monitor in the basement and one on the second floor as well as one on the main floor.There was no place we could go that had a problem with reception.I turned on the microwave, and no interference (I did this because my old wireless router had a problem and every time the microwave was turned on I had no internet access).VERY clear, no echo's and no static.This is a great way for us to listen to what is going on while the kids are playing in the basement and I would recommend this to anyone with children....not just infants.The units are fairly thin and feel flimsy....I was not prepared for the sound quality that came out of these.I should note that I have an old house (built in 1912) with heavy lathe.Set up couldn't be easier, and everything is very intuitive and easy to use.The only worry for me is if these fell they would probably break....but then, they can easily be placed in a descrete location where they are out of sight and touch.Thumbs up on this one!We've had no problems with this unit, in over a week-run test.We love the 3-way feature, the rechargeable battery, and the cordless options.It works well in our basement, outdoors too, when we've taken it out for gardening during naptime :)No interference problems, either, although there is a slight white noise, which is  very tolerable, just not "cell-phone clear."This is definitely a step above the previous monitor we used, The First Years True Choice A100 single unit variety.The biggest improvement they seem to have made with the P400 is the rechargeable battery, which was sorely missing on the A100.Other than that, the overall quality seems to be slightly better with this product.The two units are definitely a plus, as we can keep one downstairs and one upstairs.The transmission quality seems to be a little clearer than it was with the A100, although with this one we get slight bursts of static every now and then which can be annoying.Overall, however, The First Years seem to have made a good step forward in improving their product.If you're looking for a decent two-parent unit at a reasonable price, I see no reason not to recommend this.I was impressed with the physical design of this product.Second, the two handheld monitors can communicate with the main base in the baby's room, and with each other.The handheld receivers have rechargeable batteries, which will lower the ultimate cost of ownership.The cons - the contact range of the handheld receivers with the base unit was highly disappointing, and no matter how stylish the gadget looks, the need here is for something that works well so parents and caretakers can keep in constant contact with the baby and each other, using the walkie-talkie feature on the handheld receivers.So I don't recommend this product.In fairness, here are some factors that may have negatively affected my own use of the baby monitor:Architectural - I live in an old house with thick walls.Without a roof antenna, we never were able to get a TV signal into the house.This product relies upon wireless signals to work properly.Technology - My place is totally wired up, from wi-fi to cordless phones.The older generations of cordless phones absolutely did not work in my house.We've used about eight monitors over the last three years between our house and the grandparents' houses and this one is ok, but definitely not great.We just put it through a two week trial at my in-laws house, which is two stories, recently remodeled and tech heavy (wireless routers, digital cordless phones, blackberries, wireless laptops, other baby monitors, etc.).After two weeks some very clear pros and cons emerged:Pros:- 2 small parents units with chargers (awesome)- small base unit with minimal buttons- base unit has a hole in the back so you can hang it on the wall (why don't more monitors to this?What this means to us Moms: crystal clear reception without interference or static.It even has a belt clip for easy carrying.It has sound-light indicators to visually show if there is sound, a low battery light and an out-of-range indicator as well.This is a feature that we like, since babies don't always fall asleep right next to an outlet.Plus the range on the P400 is really good.They advertise a range of 1000 feet.What that means is that we were able to get to our neighbors 3 houses down before the parent unit began to beep to tell us we were out of range.(Note that we do not go that far from baby - it was for testing purposes only.)The only thing really missing on the monitor is a vibrating feature on the parent unit to alert you of baby sounds when you are in a noisy place.Otherwise, this monitor is great with it's compact units, crystal clear reception and fabulous 3-way communication feature.I needed some sort of in-house communication when my sister-in-law had (who lives with us) had knee replacement surgery.I gave her the "baby" unit and I put one "parent" unit in the kitchen and took the second with me to my home office (which is 6 rooms away in a straight line but separated by a solid block external wall).The kitchen unit, which is much closer but also separated by an exterior block wall, got really excellent reception and we could talk back and forth and understand everything clearly, not just random words.(I could even understand the dialog in the program she was watching in the background).If I wasn't in the office and went somewhere else in the house with the parent receiver, sometimes reception was very good and others just so-so.The quality of the reception is a just little canny, but not too bad.I always plug it in, I've never used the batteries.I was afraid that maybe the home wireless network, or the cordless phones might interfere with reception, but that didn't seem to be the case.Noises such as the air conditioning cycling on and off, television noise, water running, doorbells, the dryer, and the phone ringing can bother you a lot when transmitted to a receiver because you get a concentrated and artificial version of an already annoying sound.I remember that these background noises sounded the same when our house intercoms were new.I realize that this is a product designed for use with babies and not for use by people caring for sick or elderly persons.Therefore, the option I would have liked, that of being able to turn off the "baby" unit and turn it on only when needed, is a no-go.(If you turn off the "baby" unit, the other two units start beeping).But, for our situation, it would have spared me from having to hear a lot of background noise while working, and would have preserved my sister-in-law's privacy more when talking on the phone, etc.Still, for someone who is taking care of a sick, disabled, or elderly person, this is a product to consider until something more appropriate is available.Overall, I'm happy with the product.I don't think it's unreasonably priced for the performance, but I realize that performance may vary with location.I have a very spread-out, one-story house.The amount of background noise at your location will also affect how comfortable it is to use the product.I received this unit and was very thrilled because I occasionally have grandchildren spend the night and wanted to hear them if they woke up.This monitor worked from one end of our house to the other with good reception.Our house is 5000 sq.ft to give you an idea of the range capability.Other things I really like are:There are two adult monitors, one can stay put in my bedroom while the other can go with me outside.The adult monitors can talk to one another so I can have one and my husband can have the other.We can both hear the baby and we can talk to each other if necessary.If the baby monitor gets unplugged or the battery dies, the two adult monitors beep to let you know it is no longer monitoring.)- is designed to run on the power adapter full time, only falling back to the batteries in an emergency (I didn't test how long it will last yet)I travel a lot.I would like to be able to:1) charge all the units the same way with rechareablge batteries2) run the child unit for a whole day (or even weekend?)I bought these for purposes of holding snacks.The only reason I don't give 5 stars is that, because they're stiffer, the quantity and types of things they can be used for is more limited, whether holding food, toys, or other items.They're similar in stiffness to a pencil pouch- there is some flexibility, but space is kind of wasted in the corners where it's just too tight to hold much of anything.However, for bulkier items or for something more akin to a sandwich bag, I prefer the Snack Happened bags.I also store her hair clips and hair bands in them.The larger ones are great for holding a change of clothing when we go out and to leave at school.A few times when my daughter had an "accident" or got her clothes wet the teachers at her school put her soiled clothes in the pouches and they were totally water proof so that's a major plus.Placed a spoon and fork in the smaller one and it nearly punctured a hole.Guess it's a great alternative to a zip lock baggie.Love the pouches and will be buying more!not worth the money too short.my daughter has a big bad, queen size and this rail if too small for it.i use it because she does not move much, but i worry still and going to buy a different one.Also, does not get secure enough.I looked at many jogging strollers and almost didn't look at this because of the high cost.However, I'm so glad I went with this stroller.Pros:* The front swivel wheel is a huge help when navigating around the park or stores.* Reclines for sleeping baby* Huge canopy covers most of the baby from the sun.Cons:* If you plan on using this stroller as an everyday stroller, it is very difficult to get through some stores with it (I have knocked over a couple of displays trying to get the back wheels through the isles).Then the1) Battery started dying after 1-2 hrs unplugged...so annoying2) Charger cord is sorta broken and will only charge when placed at a particular angle3) I realized that having pre-set volume settings instead of a rolling one is a huge disadvantage, because the "softest" setting really isn't soft at all when your baby likes to talk in his sleep...I wish I could put this softer without muting it but I can't!That's really it.I seriously want to throw this thing across the room, it is constantly dropping the signal, makes all kinds of crackly noises, and the battery life is an hour TOPS.My house is only 1700 sq.feet!I don't get all the positive reviews on this PIECE.Spend your $100+ on another monitor; I wish I had!aren't really smooth to work with, but for the money the product is great.I would certainly recommend it to friends and family.I have had a quality issue with one -- one of the straps broke, from the top right which keeps the back upright aligned to the chair back, 4 days into use, when we were fastening it onto a chair and tightening.But this did not detract from the usability.may be a safety issue only if you are using for a very little one.But the manufacturer was extremely helpful though I have to ship back to them at my expense.I had purchased from target which refused to take back a defective used item at the store.I have the green placemat as well and the color does not match quite as nicely if you care about those things :-)I purchased a couple of these even though I have this one as well --Chicco TravelSeat Hook On Chair, Adventurefor my 18 mo twins because the Chicco is heavy and larger to put into a suitcase.For drive to vacations, where space and weight are not constraints I like the chicco better coz it puts the babies at the table.I travel a lot, so I needed a high chair that would be easy to transport.This is a wonderful product!The inside is lined in hard plastic, which is how the stuff in the storage doesn't get smashed.It has feet to add height which fold away when not in use.After I strapped it on, it could not be budged, and even though my son was leaning to the side, it stayed put and kept him contained.Overall, I love this product!!!This seats works well with children who can sit up unassisted.We needed a booster that was easy for outdoor terrace eating, instead of lugging out the large high chair.The booster chair is very portable and compact.I would say this is more appropriate for a 6 month old-1 year old or a child on the smaller side.Found this at a Target Greatland store and was thrilled to see it in person.I had been trying to decide between this and the Jeep version.I was leaning more towards this one since there is a 50 pound weigh limit as opposed to Jeep's 45 pound weight limit.Has 2 straps to secure behind and below a chair.The bottom has grips.The adjustable legs are pretty cool - you pull back the velcro, fold it back into the velcro on the bottom so those fabric pieces are out of the way.Lift the legs out and up, then push them down so they click into place - they are very sturdy when pushed in correctly.Has a carry handle and shoulder strap.Inside zippered compartment can hold quite a bit.I have a take and toss sippy cup, take and toss silverware in take and toss silverware container, soft travel pack of wipes, a small bib, and I am planning on putting more in there such as the biodegradable disposable placemats.Room for a few small toys.still room for probably a couple diapers (though we're potty training so I won't add those in).(blue, white, purple, and lime green)  Very cute and would work well with either a boy or a girl.My daughter is 28 months old and weighs 28 pounds.It's only a 3 point harness, so if you have a toddler that is good at getting out of those, it's probably not the best one for you.The interior storage fits enough for us.I also wanted to make sure I would be able to fit this in a suitcase for flights and it will, no problem.I bought this pillow after reading extensive reviews of other Snoogles.I specifically wanted the "easy" zip-on/off cover, even though it's not the most attractive pattern I've seen.Pros:- The cover was indeed pretty easy to put on.- The pillow supports me well, though I suspect I will also need a small wedge under my belly as I move into the third trimester.Others have commented on this in other Snoogle reviews.And it just gets worse with use, it seems.I think the cover is just too short there.I don't think I could relieve the tension just by restitching the seam -- I'd probably have to lengthen the cover with an insert there.- The material is not very soft.It's not bad, but it's not great, either, and requires careful washing in cold water and drying on super-low heat, if at any at all.Overall, I sleep much better with this thing, so I give it 4 stars.But that darn seam is very frustrating!EDITED TO ADD: The cover pills like mad after only a few washings!Very satisfied with the quality, softness, and durability of these washcloths, especially for the low price.Cute packaging as well that works great to store them.The only "issue" I had was the initial packaging...There was tape EVERYWHERE (all taped together, then taped closed individually, then taped to paper on the inside of each cloth).That was annoying.But other than that, 5 star product!For around $5, you can't beat it!I washed these right after I got them before using for my 5 month old baby boy, they SHRUNK a few inches in size, they do absorb well but they are smaller then I thought they would be.They are soft and cute though!We, unfortunately, were so sick of getting things thrown on our toes/broken toys/dirty bottles & pacifiers/etc.This little contraption is a lifesaver!Since getting this product, I haven't lost any snack cups!However, the thing I find annoying is the way you attach items forces you to clip and un-clip the whole thing from your stroller, or wherever you are using the product.I wish it had a clip for the stroller, and another clip for the cup (I have seen other products that do this).I trust this brand, and thought I would like this product, which is why I got this item.Like I said, it does do its' job, I just wish it was easier to use and I didn't have to take the whole thing off each time.It does what it claims, holding onto sippy cups, bottles and toys.*BUT* my main complaint is that it uses velcro - and my son has already caught on about how to rip it off - and he's only a year old.I think for securing toys and pacifiers to my stoller, theBaby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Orange/Goldwould have been a better option, just because they use snaps (which I think are a little harder to get off).I bought it for my daughters sippi cups but turns out it works GREAT for attaching my kids chew toys to their stroller or car seat so I don't constantly have to buy new ones.I'm not a total Star Trek fanboy (Trekkie/Trekker/Whatever) but why buy those boring blue onesies when you can buy this awesome lil onesie?A bit overpriced... with shipping it was over $20, and the icon is silkscreened..  For the price would have preffered an embroidered badge, but what the heck, your kid will outgrow this in no time anyway!\\I wonder tho... they have these in gold (commmand), and blue (science), but why would you buy your own child a red (cannon fodder) one?I think it's more common for the Size 1's to fit until about 14 lbs and the size 2's will fit at that weight, but they might be a tad large on a skinnier legged baby.I wish they were just a tad longer in the rise for both sizes so that each would fit longer.My baby is very long and I don't think I will make it to PLing in these and they are among the largest pocket diapers you can buy.I think the Thirsties could improve the design of the wings a little to be less "restrictive" by trimming them down a little.I found I didn't have any problems as long as I gave the tabs a little extra press when I attached them.I like that Thirsties is a really green company and they make their product in America.So they are near perfect, but by my standards, the perfect cloth diaper does not exit yet.I'm hoping Thirsties will fix that.I have tried Bumgenius and FuzziBunz, 2 of the highest selling diapers on the market.Thirsties duos are my favorite.I like that they fit a smaller baby.Fuzzibunz one size and the BG 3.0 are both silly big on a sub-10 lb baby.And normally you'd have to buy hemp inserts for an extra $5+ so getting one along with microfiber is a big bonus.Hemp dries slowly b/c it's SO absorbent so if you don't like how long they take, use them only when you need super protection.Best feature: that inserts agitate out in the wash. With Bumgenius you have to pull them out when the dipe is dirty.Yuck.Incidentally with FuzziBunz they agitate out as well though FB doesn't advertise that they do.The velcro has come loose a couple times.Might be my husband not pressing it down hard enough.That has been the only leak we've had - when velcro came undone.These diapers absorb well(much better than disposables) and are easy to care for.He's never had a rash with these, and let's face it, they're super cute.When we brought our baby home, he weighed 7 lbs.He was getting a rash from his disposable hospital diapers, so I attempted to put him in a Thirsties duo diaper.However, it was way too large for his 7lb body and left spaces for things to escape, even on the smallest setting.It also pulled at his umbilical cord stump and made it bleed, so we had to wait for his cord to fall out at 3 weeks of age to begin using these diapers.When he moves around, the velcro just comes undone and- if the diaper doesn't come completely undone and fall off- he ends up leaking out of one or both sides.He is only 10 weeks old, so my $500 diaper stash was only good for 7 weeks.My son is in the 50th percentile for both height and weight for his age- completely average- so there is no reason why this diaper should no longer fit him at only 12 lbs.I would be understanding if he were around 15 or 16 lbs when it began to stop fitting, but it's absolutely ridiculous for these to stop fitting at only 12 lbs when Thirsties claims they last up to 18.I'm now stuck purchasing an entire new stash of diapers, and I won't be including any Thirsties diapers or products in my stash.This is really too bad, because I would love these diapers if they were only true to fit.Immediately after purchase:I normally use prefolds and covers (including Thirsties Duo Wrap).The inserts can then be unsnapped when placing in the dryer (I line-dry my covers).I am still using disposables at daycare, but these might even be easy enough for them!I lowered the rating to 4 stars for a few reasons:1) The snaps on the hemp portion of the insert broke after about a month.However, I must add that the company was very good about replacing that insert for me promptly when I contacted them.2) The hemp insert takes a long time to dry, sometimes longer than my prefolds3) Velcro seems like it won't hold up great, but time will tell...Things I still like about this diaper:1) Leg gussets2) Velcro is easier than snaps for a squirming baby3) Very easy to stuff4) I like not having to pull out the insert prior to washingWe are now CDing full-time, using a combination of BumGenius, Fuzzibunz, and Thirsties Duo Diapers for daycare, grandmas and on the go (and prefolds at home).I like the all for different reasons.I like having the Thirsties Duo Diapers as part of my stash.Updated review 8/28/10I am again upgrading this review to 5 stars for a few reasons:1) This is the only diaper that my daughter can wear at naptime without leaking all over the place.There is slight wicking sometimes, but nothing like when she just wears a Fuzzibunz with one microfiber insert for naptime.2) She is still on the second rise, whereas her BG 3.0s are totally unsnapped.They held up well and washed up well.We have never had a leak through the fabric and we have not had any problems with odors to date (been using them for 7 months).However, having used both the velcro and snaps, there are pros and cons.Snaps - preserves the appearance of the fabric, but loud in the dryer, and a little more of a pain to put on as well as to adjust, plus they don't lay as well on the baby with the way they pull.I really like Thirsties diapers, we use them often for daytime,  but they have some drawbacks.Also, they can bunch up when you have a squirmy baby causing leaks.This really only happens at night or when the baby is very active during the day.Also, they pill pretty badly and some the stitching comes undone.They DO have many positives though, which is why I use them frequently: very easy to put on and clean, the velcro is sturdy, I like the liner system; especially that the liners come out on their own in the wash, they are absorbent, and the covers are very cute.Also, the fit is good.It is important to me to support US Manufacturing and I often do not trust the safety and health standards of products made in China, so I enjoy supporting a US company with my purchase.I would definitely recommend these and I think they are one of the better quality cloth diapers in terms of ease of use, durability, and fit.We went on a weekend vacation and used disposables... leaked all the time!However, i decided to make is easier for myself.istead of picking the buttols up all the time from the ground or the grass I use the sippigrip which prevents it from falling.I got 2- one for the sippy and one for the snack.Sometimes one is for a toy.Too hard for my 15 month old to get off (long bit of velcro!)and cute!So this review isn't for this exact model but I can't imagine the Pilko P3 has chnaged much since.I used it 6-10 times a week every week for 3 years.After researching strollers for hours and hours I was in limbo with one of those Graco (or similar brand) travel systems and this stroller.The price tag is hard to beat but they are SO big, SO heavy, you need a forklift to get them in the car, you need an SUV to fit them, it was very hard to push, the wheels were squeaky right away, the fabric was ugly, it felt cheap, etc.After seeing that, I returned it and spent the extra money for this stroller, and I am SOOOOO happy I did.The fabric looks great and I let my kids eat and drink in there all the time.I can't tell you how many bottles have leaked, cracker crumbs spilled, etc., etc.and I didn't had to do anything but wipe it a few times with wet wipes.I am not joking.There is no parent tray (annoying!)I just hung my purse over one of the handles and I didn't have any problems.It didn't seem to veer to one side when I did that either.I also hung my diaper bag over the back too.The drink holder for the parent is so small it doesn't hold the average water bottle and it broke off in 2 months - ANNOYING after paying so much.I am almost 100% positive I had a defective hood as none of my friends had that problem.All three of my friends who got the larger Graco ones regretted it, and one actually went and bought one of these.The selling points for me are:1) The HUGE sun canopy that is so large it can be pushed down all the way so as to cover your baby up completely so is perfect for when the sun in low in the sky and your walking towards it, or when it's windy.Nobody beats Peg Pergo and their sun canopies.2) The recline.It reclines flat or almost flat and very easily.3) Easy and smooth pushing.4) Snack tray and cup holder that can unhook on one side so you can push it open for diaper changes - or come off completely if your child doesn't want it.It just clicks and that's it.Dec 25th update:Baby is here and I can say that is very easy to use, it looks beautiful and drives smoothly.I love this play mat.Tummy time is especially better with this mat knowing it has more cushion compared to our hard wood floor.I love how you can take the mats and make cubes out of them too.Using an inflatible tub provides a measure of security for new parents and prevents little ones from having an extremely slippery surface on which to sit.Further, the inflated edges add a measure of protection for little heads if baby topples over while you are bathing him/her.The Secure Transitions Baby Tub is large; it is almost as wide as the standard bathtub in which it is placed.There is only one suction cup on the back tab of the tub; but, the bathtub in which this is being used has nonslip appliques on the bottom.I would recommend using a nonskid bathmat under the tub if you do not already have the nonslip appliques in place as they are not easily removed.Although the floor of the tub is supposed to be nonslip, I do not think it goes far enough.I would recommend getting a nonslip shower mat and cutting it to fit inside the tub as it will provide extra security.Several of the off-price stores have a wide selection of nonstick bathmats for under $10; some of these are large enough to be cut in half so one would not have to purchase two.I definitely recommend that you consider the Secure Transitions Baby Tub when you are looking for an infant bathtub.Good product overall.It is large, the compartments are handy and so far it's been very useful for our 7 month old.HOWEVER...the floor is extremely slippery.Our daughter is very active and reaches for toys and slides all over the place, sometimes falling in the water or hitting her head on the side of the tub.I am currently looking for something to put on the bottom to help and maybe purchase a foam cover for the edge of the tub.After our grandson outgrew his Tummytub we got this one for inside the bathtub - he loves it but it is slippery so we need to be sure he stays stable!The product has a good size, my baby is 26 lb and 32 in an he has room to play...I hope I can use this until he is at least 2 yo.Nice, thick splat mat that's easy to wipe clean.I have Fisher-Price Spacesaver highchairs strapped into two dining chairs, and I can put the two dining chairs side-by-side on one of these mats.It's our go-to tupperware for baby.Love that it's BPA free, too.I can heat it up via microwave or a cup of HOT water and feel okay about it.He sometimes uses a sippy but otherwise I let him drink from whatever cup-like receptacle is clean and handy so he can get used to sipping, and this seems to be the perfect size for his mouth and hands!It's also so small that if he spills some water it's not a big deal.Next, I am impressed by this  product's stain and odor resistance.are on hand, and this RESISTS CURRY POWDER!Yes, you know what I'm talking about...the yellowness and slight curry odor that clings to most plastic storage containers.It doesn't seem to affect these containers at all!I just take them out of the freezer into the night before so I don't have to microwave them.The only improvement I would suggest is that the lids be stackable.I recommend this item if you make baby food at home or want to store and transport baby food or snacks.I purchased these on a different website to avoid paying the outrageous shipping costs.I had many of the similar problems that others have talked about here.I do a lot of canning, freezing, buying bulk, etc.They are similar to this product but 8oz size, a whole lot cheaper, stackable, and can be found on Amazon or in a local grocery store.It is multi use in the kitchen (can make salad dressings, hummus, etc.)Amazon has very good price.Cuisinart CSB-76BC SmartStick 200-Watt Immersion Hand Blender, Brushed ChromeJoin Amazon Mom: http://www.amazon.com/gp/mom/signup/welcomeI love the way the containers snap together and the fact that the tops screw on instead of snap.It really does fit in the door of my freezer.I put water in one of them and gave it a good shake an it did leak.I haven't traveled with these containers yet so I'm not sure if this will be a problem.They freeze well, etc.and don't leak (so far!).They do everything this does (stack, don't leak, etc.)but they're an actual serving size.The opening is bigger and easier (mess-free) to fill.I also like that I can snap the lid on the rubbermaid ones, right out of the dishwasher, so I'm not always looking for lids as I am with these.After purchasing and using 1 set of these I immediately purchased another set.They are VERY easy to clean, easy to store, because they stack into each other and are perfect to feed the baby from.So far they work well, freeze well and microwave well.So far much better than the other options out there i think.I was really excited to purchase the Stay-Fresh reusable baby food containers.I make my daughter's baby food and was searching for a BPA-free, leak-proof containers to use for her baby food (which I freeze in cubes and defrost as needed).5oz) for the purpose of defrosting.12 containers would not go very far if I was using them for freezing purposes.One main feature sets this set above all the rest - they are SCREW tops, not pop tops like the others.I pull a serving out of my freezer in the morning, throw it my diaper bag with a baby spoon, and off I go.These are very handy!I make our own baby food and I can freeze, microwave, and serve all in these containers!Or I can freeze and then pop it out frozen into ziploc bags too.I had some of the same problems with these as the others have noted (cracked containers, lid problems).My favorite part is the attached lid - can't lose it and doesn't fall through the racks in my dishwasher.Sure Lid Lock-Seal Plastic Storage Containers * BPA Free, Leakproof, Waterproof Attached Hinged Flip-Top Lid with Lock Tab * 4 Ounce/Half Cup/118mL - 2 Per PackI also liked the canvas shelves because they are different from your average bookshelf.On the negative side, considering that it's not real wood or that big, the price was a little steep.I do wish that you could fit some more books on it - you can probably fit about 20 on the shelves all together.Overall, this is a pretty sturdy and decent product.Gave this as a gift to a friend of mine with a new baby.We purchased these tiles for use in our child's play area.We paired these with the Aosom Baby Kids Wooden Playpen Room Divider 8 Panel and we loved the result.You should note that you need two packages of tiles to fully cover the space for the Aosom Baby Kids Wooden Playpen Room Divider 8 Panel, with just a couple of left over.We didn't bother with the edging pieces because they were expensive and seemed unnecessary.We took off one star because we found that sneakers will mark and damage the tiles quickly.But hey - what are you doing walking in your baby's play area with dirty shoes?!Update:  We have had these tiles for two years.In fact, even two years later, they look good enough to draw positive comments from guests.Given how durable these have been, I have changed our initial 4 star review to a 5 star review.Plus, they have saved our son's head plenty of times when he's fallen down.These mats are nice and thick and give decent traction.(I didn't buy the edges or corners because i think they're overpriced.)Much softer than what I anticipated after reading some other reviews.These diaper liners are great.They're easy to use in the tissue dispenser style box.They're also way softer than other liners on the market for babes with sensitive bums.The only con - unlike other disposable liners, you can't wash a wet one and re-use.They just fall apart in the washer.I've tried a few liners (Imse Vimse - really scratchy, and Biosoft, OK) for use with Bum Genius diapers and like these the best.We fold them long ways, not quite in half so that they cover the most area possible.They not only protect the diapers when we are using butt paste or other diaper cremes for a rash, they also make it so much easier to deal with poopy diapers!We just drop the liner, and all the poop, into the toilet and flush it away.Now that my son is making more grown-up poop, it's nice to keep it out of the washing machine.The only thing that would be better would be if the little one could warn us a #2 was coming.When they are mostly just wetting, it feels like a bit of a waste.But they definitely keep the smell and mess down since most solids get pulled away.I cut them in half when she was in the NB diapers but wrapped them around when she got into smalls.These scissors are the best for cutting baby nails!!My sister uses a similar product from Pigeon, whcih they got from an asian store, and I have been trying to find something similar online.I'm glad I did, it is as good as the Pigeon brand.The seller ships fast too and product is as described.One mother even suggested using them to keep cupboards closed (with 2 knobs side by side, it does work)!You can use them to clip anything to the stroller or car seat, they're teethers, my baby just loves having one in each hand to hold on to.Amber's Experience (co-author of the Petite Consumer)I am the thrifty mom.When my second child was born two years after my first, I thought double strollers would be useless.Plus, they seemed like such a hassle.It was great when he was a toddler.Kept him out of traffic, with me when I was in a hurry, and still gave him the independence he desired.He wasn't strapped in.We all know how much a two year old boy hates to be strapped into anything.They defy restraint.Over time, both of my children got older and I finally succumbed to a double stroller.To my surprise, it even fit to my double stroller.It is also durable.I have taken it on rocks, over curbs, and through dirt.I have even used it with two kids at once (although I probably shouldn't have since there is a weight limit).Anyhow, if you have an independent child who refuses to sit in a stroller, consider the BuggyBoard.I would get stopped by moms, dads, grandparents, and teens just to ask me about it.We have SIX, count em' SIX at this point!3 cotton/light ones, 2 fleece (including this one) and one "luxe."The only thing is that you have to wash them after each wearing no matter if dirty or not to "shrink" them back to appropriate size as they stretch while in use.These have been a LIFE saver as he's so calm wearing them, and he'll also sleep longer at night.When we're putting it on, he's generally irritated, but we wrap him nice and tight, which is SO much easier than a blanket- and within 30 seconds, he's what we call "submitted to the swaddle" and the happiest, chillest baby ever- then he zonks.I wanted the flip feature, and I wanted an infant carrier for the beginning, planning to upgrade to a bigger carseat later.My baby does not like the angle this carseat sits at because of her reflux.Also, because of the upright angle, when used with a Snuzzler Summer Infant Snuzzler, Velboa Pink, her head tipped far forward until she developed neck control, I had to take it out because her head would tip to her chest.It worked fine in the stand alone Graco carseat though, because of the reclined angle.As for the stroller, it works great, I love the pattern, and the basket is a great size, but it is difficult to collapse it and it is very very heavy.Since since we have a small car the stroller can only fit in the trunk at one particular angle - if I can lift it that high - and takes up the entirety of trunk.When they are in the infant carrier, they face you, and when they sit in the seat, they face away.When you actually flip the handle, the "front" wheels are closer together and I end up stepping on them just walking normally.I wish I had purchased a lighter weight stroller, and a stand alone carseat so I could have chosen them separately.I need different things than come with the combination.I would still highly recommend the product for what it is, but I would recommend that you think first about whether you need a combo.BRU has it for about $30 more in a grey and yellow scheme.I like the Strata, which is what I purchased."My favorite part about this stroller is that the handle swivels so that you can push the baby facing you, or facing outward.Most the travel systems let the baby face you when they're in the snap-on infant carrier, but unless you go really pricey, it's hard to find one that lets the kid face you once they're out of the infant carrier.At one year old (when the baby outgrows the infant carrier), Mom is still the most interesting thing out there for most kids, and I want to be able to interact with my baby as I'm pushing him, vs. having him isolated from me and staring out at the world.The handle swivel mechanism is very easy to use, but locks in place with a nice, secure feel.The one and only tradeoff with this stroller (for me) is the lack of a storage tray for drinks, keys, etc.Because the handle swivels over the stroller body to change the seat from facing inward to outward, they didn't put a tray on the handle.If it were me, I would have designed a reversible tray so that it worked from both directions, but they didn't.What they did do was provide one cup-holder that sits on the handle off to the side, and can swivel with the handle.For me, that's an acceptable trade-off, but it might be a deal-breaker for others.This came with the stroller, carseat/carrier, and the stay-in-car carseat base.As with most products containing plastic products, this smelled when I first took it out of the box.We used this stroller a lot for the first 10 months or so, but once she outgrew the infant carrier, I found an umbrella stroller to be easier to lug around for shorter trips.If we're going to be out all day, I'll take this one along.CONS:  Folded up in my super-tiny Mazda 3 trunk, it's bulky (as is any stroller -- it's not any bigger than any of the other strollers I tried).The seat reclines well, but doesn't go completely upright to 90 degrees, which can bug my daughter when she wants to look around.Finally, when in "reverse" mode (child facing mom, not in the infant carrier), it doesn't turn on a dime.I think you're only going to get that with the much pricier versions, and for me, it worked perfectly fine (still turns better than my cheapo umbrella stroller).Ultimately I still say this was the best stroller for the money at the time (I haven't researched strollers since I got this one), and I'm still quite happy with my 5-star purchase.This is our second Graco travel system, as we needed to replace our Graco Vienna system for a new baby (the safety clip on the car seat broke).We are still using the carseat with the stroller, and so haven't tried to reverse the direction of the handle yet, but I'll update this review when we try that.PRO1.It is actually smaller than our Graco Vienna stroller, because the handle is jointed near the top.This is also a great feature, as my husband and I can adjust the handle to different heights when pushing the stroller.2.The stroller has a standing fold, where the back of the stroller (where the handle is) and the front (where the snack tray is) fold toward each other, and the stroller locks into place.This is better than the Metrolite, which has a hook you have to fasten while holding the stroller folded.We also liked it better than some other Graco strollers that fold down toward the ground.3.The material covering the car seat is sueded, so it feels softer and warmer that other carseats.CON1.The stroller is more difficult to unlock (to fold or unfold) that other Graco strollers.It feels like the rotating handle must go more than 180 to unlock, which is awkward.2.The cup holder is awkward and sticks out from the side of the stroller.Also, it is pretty far away from you while you are pushing the stroller - I am average height, and couldn't actually reach the cup while pushing the stroller.I removed the cup holder and replaced it with an after-market model, which I have attached to the handle closer to me.3.I do wish it had a console tray - I miss that from my old stroller.The light weight and maneuverability of this stroller are huge advantages.My baby is due next week, so I haven't actually strolled it with him.Seems easy to clean.I'll agree with some of the other reviews about the stroller doesn't steer as well with child facing you, but I think its something you could definately adjust to.There is plenty of storage under the stroller.I like it that the handle adjust for shorter people, since I am 5ft 2in.The stroller seems less bulky and lighter than other strollers I've looked at.Its easy to lift into car.I also like it that the tray in the front lifts, so that bigger children are able to get in and out on there own.I love it, and can't wait to put my little man in it!:)* Now my baby is 3 month old so, I want to actualize my review.The only con that I see in this stroller is the fact that, when you change the position of the handle bar the stroller cant be directed as well as in the original position, but is a minimal issue.This product is fantastic!!Also, the first month of my daughter, she only want to sleep in the newborn chair, and it was fantastic because she have a cleft palate and the chair was in the perfect angle for her to not aspirate her milk!The carrier is very comfortable for the baby, and the ability to attach it to the stroller and the car seat is excellent.Pros: not too heavy; pretty pattern; good car seat with easy attaching to base; sturdy stable and easy to steer; very good price for the quality.Cons: The folded stroller is very large: takes up half of our tiny elevator at home, and is a difficult fit in the trunk of our car; HUGE car seat which limits our ability to move the front seats when in the back seat; folding the stroller is fussy and requires both hands and complete attention.My favorite feature is the flip handle so you can face your baby towards you or away from.It was a little difficult to put together but I think thats a operator error more than the actual stroller.Easy to take the actual car seat in and out of the stroller.Would recommend.by ordering this swaddler.Don't waste your time/money/sleep trying out the swaddling blankets/etc.Baby is safe, secure and extremely content in this.Get two so you always have one clean.We have two regular Woombies and one "Leggies" Woombie which has legs that allow you to strap your sleeping baby into a carseat or baby swing.We couldn't live without the Woombie!!He kept getting his arms out of the swaddle I was using (the velcro kind).However, he has shown me time and time again that he is not ready to go without.Within 5 minutes of putting him in our old swaddle, he will fall asleep, whether it was for naps or for bed.So I found the Woombie.I thought it was a great idea.I got it and although he can't get his hands out, it is not a tight swaddle (by design).I don't know if I will ever be able to just use this for him to sleep.I do however use this to feed him in.It had a super soft chenille flap with a snap closure.We got a bunch of different cheater-swaddles (that's what we call them).The Summer one is adjustable and can really lock the arms down.This one is tight at the neck but too loose in the arms so my newborn is easily able to work his arms up which makes him cry.As he's gotten older, it is working quite a bit better.The person who sent me the comment was right, you can stretch the neck to make it last longer.The challenge we have now that it is actually working on his arms is that it is too short in length.One major positive with the Woombie is that our son sometimes works his hands out the bottom of the velcro swaddles which can push the material up by his face.The worst that will happen with this is that he'll break his hands out the top.The fabric is soft.Receiving blankets are scary because they cover my son's face and they're quite annoying because my escape artist "busts out" of the top of them, leaving his hands free & begins to scream.I purchasedThe First Years 100% Organic Swaddler 2-Pack, which he also "busts out of" (and by the way, are not easy, by any means) & I have nearly gone bankrupt trying to find ways to calm my red pepper, screamer of a two week old son & one exhausting night, while searching for the difference between a swaddling blanket & a receiving blanket, I came across the Woombie.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON ANY OTHER PRODUCT!We got this when baby was 6 weeks old.Prior to that we swaddled her with a light blanket but our "Houdini" always managed to get her arms free and would wave them all around her face which startled her.She fought against the Woombie, trying to free her arms, the first couple of times we used it.But she now likes it and is mucher calmer with Woombie.Have been using it each night for about 3 weeks now and have not had any problems with the workmanship of the garment.Three month update: The Woombie is still comforting to the baby and helps calm her down so she can go to sleep.My little wiggler can't get out of it, its easy to get on, lightweight so he doesn't overheat, and stretchy so that he is snuggled but not constricted.He is 5 months old now and wearing the big baby size, and it is stretchy enough that i'm not worried if he accidentally flips himself over in his crib at night, he's got enough arm movement to be able to push himself back to his back.This seller, BigBlueCastle2, is also great.The woombie was shipped promptly, and when I required about a warranty replacement (the snap ripped through the fabric) they shipped me a replacement quickly and with no hassle.Couldn't ask for more.I read on the Woombie website that they'll shortly be coming out with reversible zipper woombies, and ones which allow you to keep one or both arms free.I'm looking forward to ordering them as soon as they are available!He was busting out of the SwaddleMe every single night (grew too long for it by 4 months).Unfortunately, at 5 month exactly he learned to roll over onto his tummy from his back fully enclosed in his Woombie.With his arms encased he is totally helpless and cannot roll back.Thought the first time was a fluke but a fews days later started making a habit of it.Had to abandon the Woombie cold turkey.He is now a belly sleeper and there's nothing I can do to change it.This was a fantastic "accidental" discovery of the bamboo collection!When I purchased these particular swaddlers, I was more than thrilled at how soft they are.Perfect for So Cal weather.I ordered these because I liked the design, not realizing that they are from the Bamboo Collection.They are so luxuriously soft and yummy.Although the Classic line is great and I'm glad I have a few of them, I'm going to continue my Bamboo collection.They can be used for so much more than swaddling.My 4 month baby loves to kick off his covers- especially early in the morning when everyone's asleep and not paying attention.I found him on many occasions with all the covers kicked off, so I immediately had to find something else.I LOVE the aden & anais swaddles, so I thought I'd get the sleeping bag too.This one's particularly thick (4 layers!!!), but I know the other one (single layer) is too thin.I only wish they came with one in between... like 2 or 3 layers.We have a lot of products from Aden and Anais- they are all great.I really love this sleep sack because it is heavy enough for winter, but still breathable.We have been using it for several months and haven't had any problems with rips or the seams coming apart.I just ordered the next size up since my daughter has outgrown the small size.She sleeps in it every night,Aden and Anais sleeping bags are great especially for cold mid west winters.After about 4 months of using one bag though, the zipper is starting to go on one of the bags..it is hard to keep the bag "zipped up" it just starts opening like it doesnt zip together properly anymore.A bit fiddly to use in that respect.I do recommend these tho and will buy again.It is not coming apart at all .We live in NC and own both the one and four layer sleep sacks and have no complaints whatsoever.If you can get it discounted, go for it, it is worth the money!I don't have to worry about baby being cold at night, and they are light enough to wear in tropical places.These are the softest sleep sacks I've found.This "Little Man" design at Amazon was also HALF THE PRICE of another Four Layer sack we bought elsewhere!I tend to try and buy things that are practical and reasonably priced.I splurged on one of these sleepers when I saw it on sale.I had heard good things about the brand and wanted to give it a try.Both my husband and I like the sleeper material.It's been about three weeks now and I've found several snags.One I know happened because my fingernail caught a thread.We use velcro bibs and I try to keep them away from this sleeper because I know any contact will probably ruin this.If it was more durable I would consider buying the next size to keep up with his growth.These are kids we're talking about here, I don't have to time to be that careful.**Update**The sleeping bag did eventually result in the inner layer ripping on one seam.The sleeper was still usable but was definitely annoying to have this frayed edge all the way down one side near the zipper.I did send a picture to the company letting them know of the rip so that hopefully they can find a way to improve their future products.The only problem is that it's small (which is fine- I wanted a "security blanket" sized blanket), and it's also so thin!I wish it was just a little thicker- especially for the amount of money I paid for it.There are only a few options for snack trays with no belly bar.The red knob opens and shuts the clamp which you can get very tight (Just make sure the knob is facing away from the child)It attaches to strollers, car seats, shopping carts, etc.We only use it on our stroller.(In car seats I don't let her snack because I'm worried if she chokes I won't be able to help her in time)This is a very sturdy design, my only negative that younger children may have trouble reaching both pods since one requires them to reach outside the stroller.Overall it works perfectly for us.Oh, it was great the few weeks we had it.I even used it on a shopping cart and kept my toddler's snack and drink away from the cart and gave her something to do while I shopped.The trouble was that she kept removing it from her carseat while I was driving, dumping the contents everywhere.She broke the arm on one, and I broke the other trying to tighten it to the extent that she could not remove it.I was shocked that 2 were broken within week sof purchase - it looks stronger than it really is.It's unfortunate.This has been great for attaching to the car seat.Very easy to use and stays in place well.Considering getting one for the stroller as well.I like the way the little gripper just grips hard so it doesn't matter what angle or size the side bars of your stroller are.It sits a little far away from my toddler for him to be able to see into the cup holder and grab stray cheerios, but he'll grow into it, and it still holds a sippy cup nicely.(You could probably keep it on and fold up your stroller too).I used this on an umbrella stroller.It worked great until the plastic clamp broke when I was tightening it.I am not very strong, it should be strong enough to withstand me making it tight without cracking and breaking.Maybe they should make that piece in metal.FYI I used it on a shopping cart once to hold snacks and a drink for my daughter.Worked great with my cart cover too.As a first time parent the first few weeks of driving with a new baby in the car were nerve wracking when the baby would cry.It's really nice to be able to glance in this mirror and know that he's just crying because he hates the car seat and not because he's in some kind of distress.The light is useful for nighttime driving.The music feature isn't really necessary as we always have music playing in the car.My only complaint is that the mirror tends to slide around a little bit and needs to be adjusted after a few car trips.The mirror is large enough to be visible from just about anywhere.The reflection is a real one, not a carnival mirror reflection.The music is soothing for my daughter, and the fact that there are two volume levels is great.She just sits in her seat and stares at herself.And try popping around the seat and surprising you kiddo when momma or poppa show up in the mirror!I like the light and music idea, but the music sounds cheap and repeats an short bit of the same music over and over again in a loop.I like the design, it doesn't stick out in your car.I like that I can see my baby and that is the most important thing.As others have mentioned, putting the stroller together is very easy.The stroller was well thought out and the parts are good quality so it is literally a snap to get up and rolling.The handles while at a comfortable height for my wife (5'2" and myself 5'9") I am not sure how much taller the pusher would have to be before they became slightly uncomfortable.Also while the stroller does collapse, I suspect that others would collapse more.This stroller was more than 50% less expensive than the lest costly stroller I saw at a brick and mortar store, so it is a great value.If you are tall though, you might need one with adjustable height handles.Took it to the park last night to get a feel for it and discovered that I LOVE this stroller.fell asleep with it in an upright position and there was enough recline so that she wasn't flopping forward like she would in the umbrella stroller we recieved as a gift.Not as comfy for him but I am pretty sure that nothing will be.(Did I mention how much room is in the basket...that can be acessed from the front or back???)This stroller on the other hand was cheap.It was short (I am 5'6) and even pushing the canopy up and down felt cheap.I immediately took it apart and sent it back.I am now looking into buying a Peg Perego Si.We had a cheap little Cosco one that broke shortly after use, instead of spending another 13$ on it again, we upgraded and purchased the Kolcraft Contours, ours is bright lime green.The wheels push like a dream, they are plastic but that doesn't matter because they swivel well and are great.I LOVE the snack tray.I love that the handles are padded.My ONLY beef with this is that the sunshade is quite tall and when we used it for my daughter, the sun was always in her eyes, but it's minor, it just means when she's 5 and huge that this stroller will still work for her :)Although the transaction went smoothly, I have a problem with the product itself.They are sticky and flimsy.These are better left in the trash.I find that this gate with the extra small step at the bottom may make it even more unsafe than not having a gate at all especially if you are carrying your baby and use it at the top of the stairs.I also did not like the latch design.One of the best looking gates on the market, so probably ok if you don't use it for top of the stairs.We have the same problem as the other reviewer - the sheet is a couple of inches too short at the head and foot of the crib.We are still using it but probably won't much longer, once our baby starts to get mobile because I would worry about her getting trapped in the gap (read reviews of the non-organic version - some people have had this problem).It's a shame because changing our regular crib sheets is not easy and I really wanted this product to work for us.I purchased this for my daughter based on all the great reviews, and I was not disappointed.The quality is wonderful and the pattern is very cute with the pink and brown almost taupe dots.Very large, thick, soft!I have to say the overall quality is pretty poor.This is nothing like that, it is a box that you bolt onto the rails of the crib that sort of rattles around.We got this so that we could take a mattress on short trips or vacation and it works pretty well.Much better than your children trying to sleep on the lumpy hotel cribsWe're expecting our first baby in Jan 2011 and I bought this mattress to replace the super thin mattress in ourGraco Pack 'n Play Playard With Bassinet, Elephant Parade.I was definitely not impressed with this mattress.I knew from all the reviews that there's a slight gap (about a 1 to 1.5 inch), so I was expecting that.I didn't, however, expect this mattress to be soo soft.Not to mention that it's so thin that you can still feel the steel beams along the bottom of the bassinet.I have no idea if my baby would be ok sleeping on this or not, but it's definitely not something I'd feel comfortable on, so I wouldn't use it for my child.I guess softness is "relative", but this mattress seems way too soft for an infant (might be ok for a toddler).Fits my graco pack n play great and has excellent padding.The price was right and are exactly what I have been looking for.I searched through the reviews and feel I got exactly what I wanted.I am pleased with this product.helps to make the surface easier for a larger baby to sleep on.I have a Graco Pack & Play & this mattress fits well.There is a small gap along the side of the mattress, but it's not a big deal.It's comfy & my 1 year old slept well on it.I added this to my wish list and received it as a gift.I bought it based on the reviews and was surprised when I opened the box not only is it made of plastic, I was expecting that, but also cardboard!!I read one review that stated it wasn't.The worse part was the cardboard is wrapped around the bassinet and it not lined up correctly and caused the top plastic to buckle and where the cardboard lined up it was off an inch!It hung down an inch while the top did not have enough.Sadly I felt this bassinet was very cheap.I would not trust it to place a newborn in it.I am going to shop around for another but cannot recommend this product based on how poorly it is made.For the price this is the best bassinet I could find.The parts are plastic, but feel very durable.You can adjust the wheels to make it a cradle.Overall 5 stars!It is cute in the pictures, but the actual product is cheap and cheap-looking.Plastic legs and braces are thin, and 'wicker' baskets are actually plastic.I still have not been able to get the fabric cover to fit, and the included pad is very thin, much too thin to be used as the sole cushion for even a newborn.If you choose to not use the wheels, the bassinet becomes a rocker, which is not stable either.Prior to this my cloth diapering experience was pinned prefolds and one cover or another.BGs seemed so EASY...  and they are, but I wish they held more pee.I wanted to try a few of these as I was intrigued by the idea of a one size cover so I could still do prefolds (which hold more pee than a BG).I tried the stay dry and the organic as well as some of the econobum prefolds which, while not sold to be used with this cover, work just fine.I don't feel like the stay dry holds as much pee as a BG 4.0 even though it is supposed to be about the same.None of the 3 holds as much as a premium prefold, but the econobum and organic will get you through a generous 2 hours, while the stay dry gets dicey as you near that mark.(Bear in mind this is with 2 1/2 yo kids - obviously younger kids will pee less)  In all it's a pretty easy, compact (as far as travelling) way to diaper.The cover itself is nice and stretchy - a little bigger I'd say then the BG, as with a BG I use the biggest setting on one girl and the second biggest on the other, whereas with these I do second and third biggest.But pull on pants can be annoying to pull down.The flips covers are super trim as a cover - velcro wraps are stiff and bulky - and are working very well over a pinned infant prefold on the smallest setting.As far as the systems go, organic if you really want to hold pee, but the stay dry insert makes an awesome doubler, in a prefold, for an older baby.LOVE these covers.I bought these for my newborn, since they are supposed to start from 7-8 pounds.However, since they have snaps, there is no way to adjust the leg size, unlike Thirsties covers or Bumgenius one-size that have velcro.With velcro you can just pull the velcro tighter, even overlap the flaps to get the legs tighter.For a tall skinny baby with thin legs, like mine, it leaks everywhere since the legs can't fit.Also, the inserts are really bulky, just like the regular bumgenius insert, but without a newborn option like what they come with.These seem great and I so want them to work, but we're going to have to wait until she grows.For now we're using prefolds with Thirsties Duo wraps since they are smaller and have leg gussets and velcro to get a better fit,Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Meadow, Size One (6-18 lbs)and then we're using regular Bum Genius 3.0 one-size diapersbumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Blossomsince they can fit more tightly.*edit* Even at 11 pounds, the legs on these still don't fit our tall thin baby.*edit* at 13 pounds, these now seem to fit, though the legs could be a bit tighter, they aren't leaking.We would still like the legs to fit better like Thirsties, but washing just inserts is so easy, we'll definitely be using them from this point on.I am new to cloth diapering, and I did a lot of research before buying Flip.Love the stay dry insert.The only compliant I have is that the insert is too bulky.I have tried every diaper on the market, practically, and wasn't really sure if I even wanted to try this since I'm not a fan of prefolds.When my LO grows out of some of her small diapers I won't be sizing up, I'm just going to get more of these.The covers work well for other prefolds and fitteds and the prefold for this system is very soft and absorbent.My little one had a massive poo the first time she wore this and there was barely anything on the cover, the PF held it all!I was definitely impressed.I do really like the carseat, except for the canopy.It is inadequate at best.On the picture it is shown fully extended.You can reattach it at the back (it is velcroed in) and move it farther front, but then you will have a gap on the back.My baby is 6 month old now, and he is big - 27 inches tall and 19 lbs, and there is a lot of room for him to grow.It is nice that you can leave the handle on top, but as my baby gets bigger it is getting harder to put him in and out with handle on top, but it is nice not to have to fold it while in the car.We never had to use the preemie and little baby inserts, my baby didn't fit in them being born almost 9 lbs and 21 inches tall, so I cannot tell if they are any good.Also, it wouldn't attach to most shopping carts.I love the color/design of this carseat, it's very gender neutral.The price is fabulous as well!I was thrilled to open the box and discover that the car seat base is included with the seat, I didn't realize that until I opened it.But other than that, I love this seat!Also, I have the jeep liberty stroller, and this seat snaps into that stroller (which I also recommend!)I didn't even think that this was going to be an issue since I have other Little Legs products and this wasn't an issue.From other reviews, I knew this bag would require me to remove the wheels in order to pack the stroller.However, if you read the manufacturer's description, this is not stated ANYWHERE.That's quite misleading.In fact, the language they use leads one to believe you would fold the stroller and zip this bag closed around it.That said, I do like the idea of the bag even if the execution is a little un-user-friendly.Honestly, we're two adults with one infant, carrying a diaper bag and other needed items for a flight PLUS pushing the stroller PLUS carrying the bag for the stroller.Not exactly convenient.I know I don't sound thrilled, but here are the reasons I bought the bag:1) I don't want to own more than one stroller...so if this stroller is to travel with us, I want it protected.This bag allows for peace-of-mind gate check OR counter check if we don't want to bother with the stroller in the airport and sometimes we don't.So there are good reasons to buy this bag, especially if this is your only stroller and you travel a decent amount.!I LOVE IT ...only 4 stars because it isnt stainless steel but actually that makes it a bit lighter weight !!Oh , it IS leakproof ....not one leak and he uses regularlyThis is obviously made for a kid/toddler that knows to not tip it over or turn it upside down.It LEAKS everywhere!!!Even when the lid is closed the little air hole leaks if it is tipped over.Our toddler had it upside down and was shaking it because he discovered that it leaks a lot and it is fun to have milk splashing all over.This will go back on the shelf for a long while.Update: One month later.Still not our favorite.I wish there are replacement straws but until then I'm always buying a new one whenever the straw starts leaking at the lid's base.Babies R Us are always sold out of these so I've decided to purchase mine from Amazon now.It's a little bit more expensive but it's better than wasting time going to Babies R Us only to be told they are sold out.But that just goes to prove how popular this item is!Pros - easy to clean - dishwasher top rack!doesn't leaksuper lightlarge opening so I can place large ice cubes in it toostraw is not tough to sip out of (like other leak-proof bottles)clear visible containertakes falls from high table tops and abuse from a toddler wellCons - straws tends to not fit correctly in the base after months of constant usestraws become difficult to sip out of for no apparent reasonLid no longer snaps closed ... but that's generally after 6+ months of constant use/abuse.I like this sippy better than the first generation with the soft mouth spout.We have issues with soft part getting mildew on it with the first one we got so the hard mouth spout is an improvement.It does work well and will keep things cold for at least ten hours.All of the fogoo products recommend cleaning immediately once done being used and I can say that if anything is left in there overnight it is going to smell pretty bad.No problems except this:I can *barely* suck liquid out of this sippy cup...my one year old cannot at all.I've resorted to leaving off the hard plastic piece and only putting in the silicone piece to at least have a slow leak cup--I have to assist him because it comes out too fast this way and chokes him otherwise.I just went to look at this stroller today and just had to put in my 2 cents.This stroller is pretty darn heavy to lift with one seat.It's smaller than many tandem or double strollers but still somewhat bulky.So, for myself, I will have number 2 one day and I thought about eliminating the hassle of buying and then selling a single stroller.But, after seeing this in person, or lifting it...I'll definitely consider this when I have two kids.In the mean time, I'll stick to the much lighter single strollers and deal with the hassle of having to sell it later.Then, I got to thinking...is the City Mini Double that bad?Will it not fit through most doorways?It's so much lighter and toteable...you can actually travel with it, I feel like.I've had this stroller for about 8 months now, and I think it's been through normal wear and tear, I don't use it every day, really probably less than normal, and it looks horrible now.Even though this is a nice, expensive stroller, you wouldn't think so because of the dirt on the canopy.I've tried to wash it by hand, you can't put the canopy in the washing machine, according to Baby Jogger.but it definitely does not get off all the dirt this way.It has a lot of basket room, which I didn't think I'd need initially, but comes in handy so often.I've only used it as a single stoller, though.It maneuvers well, and is able to handle somewhat gravel paths, sand and snow.This seems like it will last for multiple children no problem.It folds up compactly if you take off the wheels, that is nice for when we travel to Europe, where people drive smaller cars generally.I just don't understand why Baby Jogger sells this color.As a first-timer, I didn't think about things like dirt showing on the stroller.I thought also since it is a light-gray, it wouldn't be so bad, but it is.It's very disappointing, because when you purchase all of the extras, like the bassinet and the car seat adaptor, etc., this stroller is expensive.Even though I think the product is worth the money, in this color it is not.A note: you need to get the Gate Check bag if you plan on flying.The airline stated they normally don't reimburse for strollers, but they were really negligent this time, and we are getting a reimbursement.The front wheels broke, but luckily we were able to order new ones for not too much money.At least it was for on the way back from a vacation.Imagine a vacation without a stroller.Just buy the Gate Check bag.I would have given a much higher rating if it were not for the color!Then I saw the previews for the City Select, which wasn't released yet.I put myself on the waiting list and eagerly waited for the stroller.I was a bit uncertain about purchasing it online without first testing it out in person, and since it was back-ordered and sold out everywhere, I was also unsure about whether I'd get it by when I needed it.Since my little one is 2 months old, we've been using it mainly with theBaby Jogger Car Seat Adaptorand myMaxi Cosi Mico Infant Car Seat - Lily Pink(which is also a terrific car seat!).Being in LA, I drive everywhere and have not had any difficulty getting the stroller in and out of my car (even several times a day).I've used it with theBaby Jogger City Select Bassinet Kit, Rubya couple of times, but my little one seems to like the snug feeling of the car seat instead.I just use the bassinet when she's sleeping for awhile outside of home and I'm not doing too much walking (like at church).Overall, this is an excellent stroller and I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone looking for a stroller similar to what I was looking for!We've had it for 6 months and it is by far the best investment we made.Snappis make it possible for me to use prefolds.I wouldn't feel comfortable using pins, and folding the diapers under the covers never seems to hold them in place well enough.If you are using cotton prefolds or flats, then these are a great alternative to the traditional diaper pins.However, they tend to tear up wool and fleece and have problems grabbing onto hemp and bamboo.Hot water and excessive heat in general will weaken the material.I recommend buying this size at around 10-12 months.Speedy shipping and instructions included on package.I gave this four stars because it seems to only be effective when used on cotton fabric.My mom bought these for me at my request when I told her I wanted to cloth diaper.She told me she thought that these were stupid and that I should just use pins.My daughter can hold them well but she's just starting to teeth so didn't seem to like putting them in her mouth.At first I was skeptical of these, especially since they are not cheap.I gave them to my son when he was 4 months old and they are his favorite teether!The slim handle is great for small hands and he seems to really like the massager, especially when gets to the back of his mouth.I keep one in the car.Regular teething rings and various teething toys just didnt reach where it really hurt.Enter this wonderful product!Long enough to reach the back teeth, but the handy circular guard keeps it from going any further so NO GAGGING.I highly recommend this product to parents of teething toddlers.Purchased several cups on Amazon and this is one of our favorites but how do you clean the straw.That is the only negative or I would be ordering another one.She learned how to suck out of a straw without me ever having to "teach" her and loves these cups.Personally, I love the safe plastic and the fact that the weighted end of the straw keeps the straw in the liquid no matter how they have the cup turned.The one concern I had about using a straw cup instead of a traditional sippy was possible spilling.But even when she has it turned upside down it hardly ever leaks.Maybe a few drops of water here and there, but no big deal.So baby can easily suck liquid out (no special biting the valve or anything) but it helps minimize spilling.This cup is great and has survived being thrown to the hard floor many times.However, I have had a few problems with them - one cup cracked on the bottom (but my daughter does bang them around a lot) and I've had more leaking issues than I had hoped.First, ZoLi was great and replaced the broken cup with no questions asked (and it had been many months since I purchased it).It's hard to even tell that it is not threaded properly unless I look at it from the side because it will feel like it goes on right, but is actually a bit crooked.When I fix this and am really careful to thread it levelly, I have no leaks.i used pins for my prefolds for the first 2 1/2 months that i cloth diapered.i wanted to try these "god-sends" people rave about called snappis.they hold the diaper well, and theyre pretty quick.they did have a bit of a learning curve, but i mastered it in a day and a half of changes.i dont like the fact that the snappi packages says "do not use for more than 6 months."good thing i got a pack of two!i do like my new snappis very much, but if you dont have them to try or think theyre a lil expensive for something that just holds a diaper together [like i did,] then dont worry.youre not missing out.but i couldve kept using pins and not have had a problem...if it keeps the diaper together, i would even do scotch tape.lol.if youre on a budget, though, and 8 bucks is too much to spend on something that lasts 6 months and is only meant to hold the diaper together, just get the pins and youll be good.[you get a free pair at GMD when you add a dozen prefolds to your order.]They stay in place well on my wiggly 10 month old girl.They seem like they'll last a long time, as they're well made.I will definitely buy more if mine break or get lost.This cover is durable - I have washed it nearly 1 dozen times and it hasn't faded or pilled.She can play in it for an hour while she laughs and coos.I have read that the musical bird dies after a while so I am hoping mine lasts at least a couple of months because my baby really likes.I needed something "smallish" to put in my purse for those times when the entire diaper bag isn't necessary but you still want a diaper and wipes, maybe a small snack, and whatever other small random items you can't live without.The good part is that this bag definitely has room for all that.The bad part (and maybe I just have spatial issues) is that it's a bit bigger than I thought it would be from the photos--hence, it takes up more room in my purse than I'd like (and I have a decent size bag).I think it would benefit greatly from even just two smaller pockets half the length of the bag--or maybe even just a small elastic inner pocket.The other thing I am not in love with is the handle/wrist strap: while it is neat in that the strap can either snap on one end of the clutch to be a top bag handle OR can snap to itself to create a wrist strap...but because the one permanently snapped end can't rotate, it means the handle must sit on the top of the bag, which adds a bit of difficulty to get it open one-handed.Day one-  So far this glider ottoman is a great buy.The box contained the padding, two very small packages of screws and hex wrenches, and two wooden rocker bases.The directions are straight forward and simple to use.Consisting of three pages with 6 steps.I assembled it in around ten minutes and it feels great.The wooden pieces came protected with foam padding and bubble wrap.The packaging and all materials were very clean.I found a few nicks on one corner, but it isn't visible unless closely inspected.My wife is very comfortable in this chair.It has plenty of room for breastfeeding.I will update this.So far, five stars!UPDATE-  The chair is a great chair for the price.It has plenty of room for breastfeeding.It doesn't squeak or make any sounds after heavy use.I had to replace the cushion the week of heavy use.It was no problem switching it out.You need to untie the strings that tie it to the back of the chair.After having to replace the cushion and spend another $25, I lowered my rating one star.I would still highly recommend this chair for the great quality and cheap price.I will update if anything changes.I'm only 5'2 and I feel like a giant when sitting in it.But I guess for the price, it will do the job-the one we originally picked out was double the price, so I'm happy we were able to get something similar for a lot less money.We've gone through our share of wubbanubs but I just had to take the time to comment on the velour textures of the Mango Monkey Mary Meyer wubbanub!!!Initially, my husband and I liked the convenience of rotating the car seat and docking it onto the stroller.However, we soon noticed a major problem.If your child is facing you (toward the handles), there is too much weight on the side of the handles.Therefore, if you put even a super light diaper bag or a shopping bag on the handles (or if you're strolling uphill even without a diaper bag), the stroller will fall toward you.When my baby was 3 months old, I stopped on the street to tie my shoelace and the stroller came crashing forward.Fortunately, my baby was strapped in so he wasn't hurt but the fall did startle him... and my soda on the handle bar spilled all over me.There are other problems with the Orbit system, but I think this design defect is a major problem that should be addressed.Recently, we had the same issue with the toddler stroller seat (my baby is now 16 months old and weighs about 27 pounds).I had my baby facing me and only had a sandwich bad on the handle bar that weighed at most 3 pounds.My baby was sleeping when I decided to check my mail.When my baby woke up, he sat up and leaned forward, which caused the stroller to fall forward again.My baby was strapped in so he wasn't badly hurt other than the scrapes on his hands.However, this problem is a dangerous problem that Orbit should address immediately since another child may not be as lucky.The problem with the toddler stroller seat is that, in addition to the stroller being unbalanced as it is, the toddler seat flaps forward when a child sits up.Therefore, the weight of the child leaning forward will cause the stroller to fall forward.I brought this problem to the attention of Orbit.They claimed it's not a design defect and just offered a small discount on the G2 version.I find their response totally inadequate.There are other annoyances as well -- the baby can't put his feet up; it's difficult to rotate the seat with one hand when you have to lift the bottom of the seat and the baby's feet with the other hand; it is extremely difficult to fold up; it is incredibly heavy and big that it's very hard to lift the stroller with the seat into a car trunk and even fit it there.PVC is horrible for the environment.Fits well on Bugaboo Bee 2010.This mat is really nice since it has lots of stimuli and can be configured several ways.Our 1.5 month old baby is a little too young to react to many of the stimuli but I think this is a good mat to purchase as it is can be used as a basic mat or converted to a baby gym.What is maddening is the annoying, frustrating packaging.There are soooo many of those plastic ties (not the twist ones, the ones you have to cut)... maybe around 20 or even more!I'm not a fan of those especially on children's toys and clothing.Sometimes after cutting one end you lose the other end -- what if it irritates the baby's skin or worse, what if a child finds it and puts it in his mouth.I wish the company would just keep the packaging simple...My rating:B+ for the productF for the packagingThe side bumper things are perfect for her to lean and rest her head against, and the bouncer sits her fairly upright, which I like because it doesn't restrict her airflow at all, like carseats and some other bouncers and swings can.I'd buy this again in a heartbeat.When I saw the word "Automatic Bouncer", the only bouncer that automatically bounces, I immediately bought two at Target (I was originally only going to buy diapers).What a total dissapointment for an "automatic" bouncer.If your baby weighs more, it just taps the bottom of their feet.It seems to have a ball inside the bottom and the ball just moves back and forth and does a tapping sound/movement.Not much with a baby (mine was 9.lbs when I put her in the bouncer).The nice thing about it is the cloth material it's made out of but it's not worth the price just for a "pretty" seat.I am definitely returning them in the morning.I purchased this bouncer for my newborn and I am not very impressed.It is a great concept and I hope that this company or another company will try to better this product.It could be one of the best baby products out there is done properly.My 3 month old daughter does well in this bouncer for moderate amounts of time.We put her in it, stick a pacifier in her mouth, and she bounces away while we cook and eat dinner.I will not attempt to put her in it when she is cranky.Other than that, she prefers to be in the matching swing, but every baby is different.My husband and I first purchased the Fisher Price "My Little Lamb" swing.Long story short, two returns later, we bought this swing.My daughter slept so well in this.Against my mother's advice I let her sleep in this during the night and she slept much longer than in her bassinet, giving me and hubby a little extra sleep.She transitioned just fine into her crib at about 1 month and now at 2.5 months sleeps for 10 hours!!:) During the day she loves to sit and watch the bugs hanging down, she thinks they are HILARIOUS!It's a great bag and the price was great also!Dad got this bag at a local store when we went into early labor and thought the baby was going to be here tomorrow.My complaints:-- The interior is huge and has no pockets to subdivide the space.-- The changing pad is so small and flimsy I found it useless.-- The exterior pockets are so big it's impossible to reach in and grab, with one hand, in a hurry, the pacifier/lanolin/vaseline/ibuprofen.-- The shoulder strap is awkwardly arranged on the bag, so the bag does not stay over your shoulder unless you can give balancing it your undivided attention (or, you can give it to Dad to carry).-- The pad on the shoulder strap provides no real shoulder protection.I replaced it with one that is much smaller, with much better construction, good organization, sturdier build, and for a lower price.Definitely keep looking unless all you want is a big huge duffel bag.This gate is very easy to put up and it doesn't look too bad because the colors are neutral.I have it stretched close to the max (about 55 inch archway), so it looks good...if you put it in a smaller doorway then the fabric will be bunched up and look sloppy.If it is in a high traffic area then I would not recommend this...we put it in an archway that we don't really use, so it is perfect for that.Also, our dog doesn't jump on it and our baby isn't walking/climbing things yet; so I'm not sure how well it would stand up to a child trying to climb it or push against it.I'm only giving four stars instead of five because this is a standard pressure gate, and has all the minor annoyances that come along with that mechanism (mostly that it's a bit of a pain to set up, and you always feel like you're forcing the bar down even though the instructions specifically say not to force it).But it does what it needs to: it blocks doors for toddlers, but even lets through cats that are too stupid to jump over a two-foot-tall gate.Note: I had to change my review due to a recent experience with this product.[...Instead, he has to jump over.If they made a larger opening, the gate would be great.Though I would purchase this gate again, there are some points of interest to share:1.He throws small items through the hole to the other side.If it would somehow open and allow you through and still have a pet hole, that would be ideal.Bear in mind, we don't have a lot of experience with other gates so the points I've listed above may just be normal in the world of baby gates...I think though if you do have a smaller pet, this gate is worth it.New comments:Recently my son was able to push the gate and fell on top of it.It seems that the tension starts to wear out and doesn't hold the gate up as well.If you are looking for a light, portable, easy-to-fold high chair, then this may be for you.I liked it so much I got one for each of Baby's grandparents.The only thing I would say against it is that the back is angled back a bit and is not adjustable.Smaller and younger babies (like mine) probably need a towel or blanket put behind them for padding and so they can sit up straight.The only problem with this high chair is that yes it does fold flat for storage but if it's not put up in between something it will slide and fall flat on the the floor it also doesn't stay completly folded if you try to move it somewhere, it trys to unfold itself.other then that the material is easy to clean the tray is plenty large enough it's secure once it's standing and locked and my child thinks it's the greatest thing sicne sliced bread.First, let me point out: There are some other Cosco "Flat Fold" high chairs that are 2x or 3x the price.Don't spend the extra money unless you absolutely need a different color.Now, on to the review...Pros:-Pre-assembled, easy to set up.-Folds up, portable, light weight.-If you take out the foot rest, it folds flat.-Wipes clean easy.-Tray has cup holder which doubles as a built-in bowl for snacks.-We tried ALL the chairs at Target & Babys R Us, and this was our favorite in terms of space saving & portability ... and to our surprise it was the least expensive too!(We paid $30)CONS:-Seat back is not adjustable, is too reclined for young children.-Tray has 3 positions, but still is not close enough for young children.-It requires both hands to collapse the chair (you can't do it with a child in your arms)-Biggest problem: Tray release tabs break easily (broke 2nd time we used it!)(The fix -- If the release tabs on the tray pop off, they can be re-assembled without tools: Line up the pin & spring, and snap it back in.The design flaw is that the plastic tabs holding the release triggers in place are not big enough or strong enough.If it becomes a persistent problem, drill a hole through the middle of the plastic tabs and insert a metal rod, a pin, or a screw ...just make sure it's smooth on the end and can't scratch your child)We have a 9 month old, who weighs 22 pounds.I can't believe how small and flat this highchair folds.Since purchasing it a month ago I have probably used it 5 different times.It is so convienent to have a highchair in the back of our SUV ready to use.I have used it at an ice cream store which didn't have highchairs, my 8 year olds Valentine party, Grandmas house, and a friends house.It  also has the middle bar between the babys legs to keep baby from slipping.This has been 30 dollars well spent.October 2010  Our 16 month old who is now 27 pounds is still using this highchair.Again it was 30 dollars well spent.I just bought this chair, mainly because I wanted the space saving option.Also it is easy to take the back apart to clean, even inbetween the seat and the chair part, they are made to come apart to step up through the 5 stages.I think if you like a nice space saving booster/highchair that is durable and easy to clean, then this is the one for you!AND it helps that almost everyone carrys it in the store for such a reasonabe price.I had purchased the Summer Infant Soothing Tub and Shower and was disappointed to learn the bath sling cover that came with it was not washable.It's also padded, so it got moldy and gross.I got this sling to replace it.It fits well, and it's not padded so it dries better.Hopefully we won't have the mold problem again!Well it turns out it's a great little drying rack.It's just a great all around drying rack.I will definitely recommend this to friends.This is the best drying rack!You can put things on it without even looking!Ii put EVERYTHING in it!glass bottle stay up, piece of bottles, pieces of breat pump, etc etc etc!I bought a countertop drying rack from babies r us and it was clearly designed with plastic in mind!I tried everything to  have it hold my glass bottle...tape...crazy glue, but nothing worked!THis is a lifesaver for glass bottles and we have a lot of them!I run an eco-friendly home childcare and we have a lot of glass so this does the trick!Best of all its BPA free!:) Go BOONBoon should consider making a bigger version of this drying rack.I had to order two and it is expensive.You would NOT believe how much this thing holds!Excellent product for baby bottles, etc.The spinning rack was always full so we oveflowed everything onto dish towels to dry.It is a little small, so we ended up going and getting a 2nd grass drying rack.Definitely easy to use, easy to clean and allows the bottles and parts to dry without a mess.I actually bought this to use for my breast pump accessories (Medela Freestyle.)I actually have two, one at home, and one in my office.We'd been using the Dr. Brown's drying rack, which wasn't cutting it.When I explained we were hand-drying most things to be able to use them/pack them for daycare the next morning, she recommended the Boon Grass rack.No more hand-drying for us!We did buy a second one to cover the bottles and breastpump accessories we use in one day (4 five-piece pump attachments, 3 six-piece drinking bottles, and 5 two-piece breastmilk storage bottles) but I would have paid ten times this price to cut down on our daily routine.I love this drying rack because I can put anything on it.In my eyes that means it does not take up unnecessary room on my counter.I do occasionally need to put all my bottles on it when they come out of the dishwasher wet and you can arrange them to all fit.The key is that there is no predetermined set up to it so you can squeeze quite a lot on here.Overall, I think this offers a lot of flexibility to fit as much as you need, or as little in my case.I have also had a few people comment on the aesthetic of it, even non moms, which you don't often get on a bottle rack.I can see us using this for a long time as it works great for holding tiny parts that otherwise slip around in my sink rack.Buy it you won't regret it!What's really nice about this design is that you can hang the bottle parts off the sides of the dryer.The parts are half on and half off.I find this makes the drying process faster and gives you so much more space.We have the Playtex Ventaire which has 6 parts per bottle so there are a lot of parts to dry.I would say that this dryer is convenient for about 6 bottles.After 6, you may find it difficult to arrange.It is not a design flaw, just a limitation of how many items you can "stick" in the grass.I noticed a lot of other reviews mentioning this rack being "great but small" and it makes me wonder how many bottles they use in a day.I could probably fit another 3 if I wanted to.I hook the bottles on the side, with only about 5 or 6 "blades" of grass.This drying rack is awesome, its pretty small, but holds a lot of bottles for it's size.It's much better than other bottle drying racks, because it can hold all pieces upright so you don't have water collecting in any parts, so everything gets completely dry.Edited July 7-28-10:  I added a picture of just how much this rack can actually hold.They ALL fit.Works great for everything I've thrown on it.Just have to remember to wipe it out periodically as water will accumulate at the bottom since it doesn't drain.This play yard couldn't be easier to set up!So I wanted something that he could nap in.I previously purchased another play crib for him to use at my parents' house.The bottom is also more padded than the other crib I previously purchased.Also, it's cuter than it appeared in the pictures.I assembled it as cubes and he loves throwing them and then goes fetch them...he laughs every time they hit him...specially because they are very lightwieght and doesn't hurt him!This is the preferred pacifier of the house.My little one, who is pretty laid-back, will not go to sleep without this.It is, quite possibly, one of my best purchases...ever.It's like a teething ring and pacifier combined...which is genius.Why didn't I think of that?My only complaint, which is very minor, is that the gel rings on the side start to show wear.They are a little on the expensive side as far as pacifiers go.But, since these are a favorite and the pacifier stage is short one, they are worth the money!It's so helpful that I just bought a second one - one to keep upstairs, and one to keep downstairs/travel with.There are two things that would make the product even better: 1) if the outer pocket extended around the pillow; and 2) if you could order replacement covers (having just one cover makes it difficult when there are messes...).Overall, though, the pillow has supported my big twin boys very well, and the panel that snaps around the back is very helpful in supporting my lower back.Plus, the material is nice and soft.I recommend this product highly!This pillow is more expensive, but much better.Extra covers available for purchase from My Brest Friend.Good back support.Lip at edge helps keep babies secure.Cons:  Cover material is slightly stretchy, making it hard to get the pillow tight enough around my waist - it slips down below my waist regularly.Don't see how I'll be able to use it when my twins are a year old - I just don't think it will support their weight.At 8 months, I've started to put pillows under each side to keep the pillow at the height I need.I can only use football hold with this pillow.Suggestions:  Turn it inside out when washing otherwise the velcro sticks to everything in the machine.We purchased this Thermos (with the Hello Kitty design from Target) over 1 years ago.It is one of the best kids drink holders I've ever had.We actually have two, one blue one pink.They each came with an extra straw set but my originals are still going strong.I can put ice water in it in the morning and send my daughter to camp (outside, no refrigerator) and when she gets home late afternoon, there is still ice in it.We use them for lunches, travel and daily household use.Milk stays cold for up to 12 hours (although we don't usually let milk stay out that long).It has been tossed around (not dropped from any great height) and has rolled around the mini van and the only wear it shows is with the imprint on the outside.We do not wash it in the dishwasher although I think you can and I take the straw apart each time I wash it - it is a two piece part.Since we put milk in it, I often clean the straw out with a pipe cleaner so that any residual milk is removed.I use a knife point to go around the inside of the straw connecting point because this can sometimes build up some milk stuff.It sounds like a lot but it takes less than a minute to wash and I feel like it is clean when we are done.It reassembles so easily.*******************************UPDATE 9/3/2010I just purchased another Funtainer (from Amazon) so that we had one at school with cold water and one at home.Coincidentally, my daughter just dropped our old one at school and the top broke.In defense of the product, she dropped it on a hard floor.I did want to point out that the one we just received from our Amazon order did not have an extra straw set but seems to be well constructed like our older one.This carrier is great, I love the fact that it offers so many positions.I lifted it and it felt like it weighed 10 pounds.I wasn't even interested in borrowing it.It's hard enough to carry a baby around without all that extra weight!This carrier is so lightweight and fits great.I've already had to send mine through the washing machine and it held up perfect.My baby really seems to like it too.I usually use ring slings and Moby wraps (all great), but wanted something for my husband and something sturdier than the slings.It is NOT an issue.The instructions are a little difficult, but once you get what they mean, it is a cinch.Also, you do not need the infant insert unless you want to do a cradle hold.An infant can face towards you without the need for the expensive insert.I learned this the hard way and had to send it back.I'm a bit obsessed with baby carriers.I've tried so many of them - Bjorn, Bjorn Air, Hot slings, Maya Wrap, Ergo, Ergo Sport, Catbird Pikkolo, Cybex 2.go.I tried out a lot of carriers until I got this one.The Cybex was nice and is very well made, but it seems to hurt my hips.Its my favorite carrier now.It does have a bit of a learning curve figuring out how to use it because it has so many carrying options.If this is your first carrier, you might need to practice a few times.I found the back strap (the one that goes a across your shoulder blades) to be easier to secure than the Ergo.I found the padding in the shoulders to be very comfortable and I liked that I could move it around to where it fit me best.The pocket is very roomy and fit a tube of sunblock, my phone and keys.Definitely a great find.I read a lot of reviews while searching for a baby carrier.I chose the Lillebaby because of the good reviews I read about it regarding it's light weight and multiple options for carrying baby.I have now used it at least 10 times and there are pros and cons.The cons are that it is rather difficult to adjust the straps and the material is not very thick and strong.Recently, I purchased a used Ergo carrier in order to have a second carrier because my husband and I were tired of having to adjust the straps back and forth between us.If I were to do it all over again, I would purchase the Ergo instead of the Lillebaby because the Ergo has the exact same design, but it is made of a thicker, sturdier material.One of the adjustable snaps for the pads on the shoulder straps of the Lillebaby carrier ripped right out of the material when we were trying to adjust the straps for my husband, so while this does not affect the safety of the carrier, it just makes me think the whole thing is not very strong.Additionally, the Ergo straps are about twice as wide and have thicker padding which is more comfortable, especially for a larger person.The Ergo is only $5 more than the Lillebaby, so it is well worth it for sturdier construction.And it's even cheaper if you find a good used one to buy!I have a Baby Bjorn and I wanted something that's more light weight.I have heard good things about the Ergo carrier, but it doesn't allow the baby to face out.There are few steps involved in putting it on, but not too bad.I had my husband try it too, same thing.Comparing to my Baby Bjorn, the Lille Baby seems much harder on the back.After having my pump since May 2010, the tubes started looking a little worn.Not a bad price, either!This product is fantastic.The moble is also nothin special.He did not endorse this swing, he just recommends swings in general.We purchased this swing because it is small and transportable.To our dismay the settings on the swing were not fast enough.Even on the highest setting the swing barely moved.Our son only weighed 11 pounds at the time, so it is not a weight issue.It is also very loud and he responded negatively to the vibration.The swing is currently collecting dust in the baby's room.I bought this swing when my baby was 4 weeks old.She loved it from the start although she wouldn't sit in it for very long.Each week she'll sit in it for longer periods of time and now, at ten weeks, she will even nap in it.The fish toy grabs her attention and the music is soothing.I did end up calling their customer service because one of the arms would swing too loosely, but they told me this is normal and necessary for the swing to actually swing.I would have given it 5 stars but I didn't because:1- It has no neck support.When it does, my baby will want to get out, and it doesn't matter if I start it up again.I started to put both the swing music and play white noise via radio in the background.Now when her music runs out, she still has the white noise and she doesn't seem to wake up or cry for me to get her out.Overall, awesome product!I would definitely recommend this.This swing is great.I kind of agree with the negative of the previous review.The hanging toy is nice, but it's not really in a place where my 2 month old can see it yet.It swings out of the way so you can put the baby in without hitting their head.I was worried the harness material would be too rough since it goes over the shoulders, but I like the harness.There are two shoulder levels for the harness.My daughter likes it and it's a nice change from all the classical music her other toys have.I did it in about 10 minutes or so.The back half of the base and the hanging toy also detach to travel in the car; it doesn't fold.The two round pieces at the top of the swing are handles and I can carry my 2 month old between rooms when she's in the swing.The swing lock, which makes it a feeding chair, isn't very useful.It's kinda difficult to latch/unlatch.It also springs back and hits the chair if you let it go.My daughter spits up a lot, so I just don't use it yet so I don't have to get her in and out of the seat.The only downside is the swing mechanism.When I first started the swing she wasn't in the seat and it barely moved.Once I put her in it though, it did swing much better; I think it needed some weight.However, even though it has 5 settings, I don't feel like I really see much of a difference between high and low.They're both pretty slow.My 5 week old wiggle worm is constantly waking himself up with his hands.I have been swaddling him, but he always breaks free.He manages to move his arms from his sides and gets his hands up on his chest - but that is not enough to wake him up.He sleeps so snug and cozy in this thing.So far all the Summer products have been worth every penny.I like this for a sleep sack but the swaddle part doesn't keep my little mover/wiggler in.I wanted a swaddle for 14-22lbs that was cotton.I ended up getting the organic summers infant cotton swaddle and it stretches to fit my 18lb little boy.The fold over sleeves keep his crazy hands covered and he sleeps all night without waking himself - like he would do otherwise.I even leave him in one in the morning when we take my other kiddo to school.I just unzip the bottom zipper a bit and pop his legs out to get him in the carseat.They are worth the money.However, the arms seem like they are a little long.But I am afraid that once he grows into the arms, he will be too tall for the sack, as he only has about three to four inches until his feet hit the bottom of the sack.If they could improve the proportions of this sack, I would give it 5 stars.The zipper is very convenient because it can unzip from the top or from the bottom, so you don't have to take the baby's arms out if you just need to change the diaper.The zipper tab at the top tucks into a little pocket so it won't accidentally get unzipped.I purchased this for the same reason as most everyone else did.. the price and the shoulder straps.When I received it, I definitely liked the quality of the material and the ability to keep some things in the pouch so I don't have to lug a diaper bag around.We took it to the local (red bullet)shopping center and immediately realized that it wouldn't completely fit over the cart.The carts there are pretty large, and the seat back is wider than the cover.The next issue we had was figuring out how to strap him in snugly.At a restaurant last night, we spent almost 10 minutes trying to figure out how to attach it to the high chair.I cannot locate the instructions online (thinking it would be simple and obvious to install, I threw them away) so it's possible we're missing something.This definitely won't keep him from trying to escape, either.It is extremely convenient for many reasons:  it folds into a bag with handles so it is easy to carry, it can tie onto carts and highchairs and has its own belt, the pocket holds a lot of stuff which is great when grocery shopping with a baby, it is really well padded, it can be put in the washer and dryer, and toys can hook right onto it so they don't keep falling on the ground.I highly recommend!The only negative I have is that one time it did not fit well on the shopping cart and the strap ended up around my daughters neck.Of course I was right there so it wasn't there long.The straps that go over the shoulders are not adjustable and are a little high so if it doesn't fit the cart well you do have to be careful.I hate this cover.Granted, it's the only cover I've ever used, so I can't compare it to others.Then when I load the baby in (highchair mode) it seems to slide down with him so he's half sitting on the back part.Strap him in and he doesn't have full use of his arms because it's so low.It does do a good job of covering everything like it's supposed to.When it's on the shopping cart it makes it hard to grip the cart because the fabric prevents ur fingers from wrapping around the handle bar of the cart.I hate this thing.Maybe I would hate all shopping covers if they are all like this, I don't know.But I just had to add my two cents since the reviews are so high and it's so cheap which enticed me to buy it...I love these hooks!Since our stroller does not have much space to put things, these hooks allow you to hang all your bags!The hooks are made very well, and things will not slide off, which was one thing I was worried about.The hooks are very study and the velcro is high quality so you are tempted to overload it.I love a product that serves more than one purpose!I bought the "Delta Children's Products Riley Mini Crib - White", which came with a very soft and thin 1" mattress.I couldn't find anything .Matresses were either too soft (from what reviewers wrote) or their sizing was wrong for the crib.I decided to try this mattress despite the fact that it was a little bigger than the crib, because it was supposed to be very firm.To my relief it fit!!Well, granted, they call this mattress Extra Firm.However, this is like laying-on-concrete-firm, not like a "firm" mattress you might imagine.We wouldn't even use this with our infant, let alone our toddler because it's basically the same as the cardboard 'pad' that comes with the Pack & Play.I was looking for a firm mattress and took a long time picking one out since most companies like to rave about how soft and comfy their mattresses are.This mattress is definitely very firm.I should have listened to my gut and stuck with the Pack 'n Play as-is, but so many people said they preferred an added mattress I thought I'd try it.)Now then, when I say "Firm,"  I mean FIRM.I haven't yet washed it to see if shrinkage makes it much worse, however.It makes me feel more comfortable knowing my daughter wont ever knock her head while rinsing her hair.This cute frog spigot cover fits our spigot well and diverts water into our kiddie tub, which is very convenient.The big problem is that there is no hole for the shower diverter.I think I will cut one out so I can keep the cover on full-time.This worked better than the Boon spigot cover that did not fit our spigot.The Skip Hope spigot cover does not divert water, but it has a hole for the shower diverter.I love this mat so much that I now have two of them.One is at my house and the other is at grandma's.Nice cushy mat with sounds and textures on it that keeps the baby interested for awhile!Also, great for when we visit the grandparents...there's no crib so we just put the mat on the floor and the baby just takes a nap there!I was looking for a soft mat to put over my carpet floor for my daugther to play around in.We got this when my daughter was 6 months old.We uses it for her tommy time, for her to learn to sit and learn to crawl.There are couples of educational toys for the baby to discover.He laughs when I give it to him and likes to snuggle with it next to his face.I will admit, when I first opened the box I was a little disappointed at the size - for some reason I was expecting it to be slightly larger.The quality is very nice and the character (I chose the bear) is quite cute.They are really plates and bowls!The body of the plate is at least 1/2 an inch deep and able to hold cereal and other liquids.One of my concerns is that while the plates are slip resistant, there is not enough of a base that comes in contact with the table surface to really be slip resistant.Also, when washed in the bottom of the dishwasher the plates warped.Directions did not indicate top shelf only.I've been searching for a short plastic spoon for my 15-month old.A lot of the spoons in the store have a plastic handle and metal on the part that goes in their mouth.Definitely not good for a teething toddler!These spoons are the perfect length, and the scoop angle on the spoon is just right.Definitely recommend!This bag is very nice.Excellent Product!It moves so easily, it is super quick to set up and take down.Best of all this is an AMERICAN company and A GREEN company.Would buy from them again!I went to Whole Foods with her in this and was able to put my entire shopping list of items in it while I strolled her around...4 canned goods, box of pasta, several large peices of fruit, large loaf of bread, bag of seafood, truwhip, and olive oil.It rolls like a breeze through stores, cuts corners great, has nice tall handles for long strides and no kicking the wheels, my girl seems super comfortable in it because the seats are meshy and breathable - and we're out in 96 degree Atlanta weather.This is a sturdy zippered wet bag that does a good job storing anything wet in the diaper bag or travel bag.It closes with a YKK zipper, the outside is printed cotton fabric, and has a waterproof lining.(I got the print: Blue Mod, and the lining is dark brown.)The description claimed that you could fill this with water and it wouldn't leak out - I tried it, and it works!I also washed it, and there was no wear.Very useful item, I plan on getting more.I've tried several different types of wet bags and this has been my favorite so far.It is made of the same PUL type fabric as the Planet Wise diaper pail liners, and as such is easier to care for than the Wet Happened bags that I also have.While one expects this of a diaper pail in one's one house, if you are using this for traveling, realize that this may become stressful in a house that doesn't belong to you.We let it go for 3.5 days once because we weren't sure how our friends would feel about us putting dirty diapers in their washing machine.Instead I ended up scrubbing carpet (where the bag sat) and airing out the room to remove the evidence of our stay (it cleared out quickly :-) ).The next time I just brought my detergent with me and did a wash on day 2- there was zero smell and everything was completely dry.I highly recommend this bag for short or overnight trips.It can hang on a door or hook, but I hate having things hang from my doorknobs, so I can't comment on the effectiveness of that.The handle is nice for carrying it when full.For home use, I still prefer a pail with a liner.It's a lot easier to tap open a pail lid with my wrist than to try to unzip a laden wet bag with one hand while holding a dirty diaper and a child.I absolutely love this wet bag.I have a Bummis wet bag as well and I def prefer this one even though my Bummis serves a different purpose (the bummis for home and this one for on the go).this is a great bag.i bought one bag to use for my baby's cloth diapers when we're on the go and so far, no leaks or smells leave the bag.i use gdiapers so it definitely fits way more diapers in the bag than the description indicates.i throw it in the washer along with the rest of the dirty diapers.i ended up buying two more bags to use for dirty bottles in the diaper bag and for my dirty breast pump parts when i'm at work - way better than wasting ziplock bags all the time.Great idea for dirty diapers!I'm sure this bag would work great for disposible if you can't get to a trash right away, I plan to use it for my cloth diapers.I really wanted to be able to use cloth diapers for everywhere I go and so having a bag like this is perfect for making that possible.I can't wait to see how this goes when traveling through airlines and going through bag inspections.Also, on another note, I love how trendy looking this bag is.Okay, maybe after all of the great reviews of these bags I had unrealistic expectations.This bag is good, and I would buy it again.It's the best option I've found for cloth diapering on the go, but it's no miracle bag.And 1 cloth diaper (bG OS 4.0) had it pretty much full so beware, the small is really small.Amber & Ilana's ExperiencePlanet Wise Reusable Wet Bags are a sign of the times.Many people have gone back to basics and are using cloth diapers making wet bags very mainstream.If you are not a cloth diaper user you may not know what a wet bag is.Essentially, it is a waterproof bag that you put your dirty diapers in until you can clean them.However, the uses of the Planet Wise bag does not stop or start there.These wet bags can be used for a variety of things and are not limited to the cloth diaper user.We have used them for wet bathing suits, soiled clothes, disposable diapers, disposable wipes, and dirty wet shoes after a muddy adventure.Maybe they will be best used at the gym for your sweaty clothes.The possibilities are endless.CoosPVC free and Lead free zippers.Waterproof liner.Machine washable (Amber has been washing one of hers for over a year).Durable.Earth friendly - reusable (we love "green").Odor resistant.Odor reducing (Really helps to tame the stench).Lots of great prints (They are almost to pretty to hold the "ick-ies").3 sizes with small holding 1-2 used diapers and large holding up to 16 used diapers.Large size has a strap attached to hang on the door etc.Can be used beyond diapers  (We always love items that can grow with us).Wet/Dry bag optionsLots of coming soon items including:Sports SackSandwich WrapSandwich BagSnack BagI love this bag!I also have the larger one with a handle to hang on the doorknob.Planet Wise makes a mighty good wetbag.I've never had a problem with leaking.I dry mine in the dryer each time, and it dries quickly without showing signs of wear and tear.I like that these bags ZIP instead of just having a drawstring--I feel like smells are totally contained that way.This bag makes cloth diapering on the go a little easier!Cute too!I was debating whether to get this or a B.O.B.and chose this one for the $ difference.I think I made the right decision.Yes, the front wheel doesn't swivel-but a good jogging stroller is supposed to be built like that!All in all a great jogger for the money!We purchased this stroller for our 4 months old son and it is great for running.There is one thing I would like to add to the first review made by Monk Fan.The pedometer is junk.It only worked one day, and we were never able to use it.We do not use the music player, but we love all the storage space.The less stuff, the better.So we looked and looked online, read Consumer Reports reviews, and talked to people we knew.One plus for McClaren!Another major plus is how lightweight and yet sturdy the Techno XT is.It turns on a dime.Oh, and the sun shade is huge!Another reviewer mentioned not putting kids under 3 mos old in it, and I just want to include here that we used a head support insert in this stroller at first.So if you want a stroller for mega-shopping, look elsewhere.They are surprisingly absorbent too given how thin they are.That being said, I would definitely buy these again.These are vastly different than the previous type of breast pads I was using (Lansinoh).I was looking for something that wouldn't turn into a lumpy mess after flipping them down with my nursing bra to nurse.These fit that bill -- they're VERY thin, and they do conform to the breast nicely, as long as your breasts aren't too pointy.There is no adhesive, but as long as I wear these with a supportive/close-fitting bra, they seem to stay in place.The shortcoming of these is that while they're very absorptive, if you leak enough to saturate them they'll ooze out the edges, because the edges are not sealed.To be fair, this was only a problem for me in the first week or three of nursing, until my supply regulated, and then again when I started back at work and had to get the hang of finding time to pump.That's easily remedied with some double sided garment tape (likeBRAZA S1009 Body & Clothing Double Sided Flash Tape), however.Edited to add: I also find that when I wear these for longer stretches, they sometimes stick to my nipples, making them a little painful to remove, and they leave small fibers stuck to my nipples.I also have the same difficulty that another reviewer noted -- it can be difficult to figure out which side goes to the breast if you're in a low-light situation.SO, far it has worked amazingly well.It is super soft and insulates him well.The head support that came with it was awful and we tossed it.We tired the JJ Cole one hoping that it would work, other ones had not.The arm wing looking things fill in the sides of the car seat so the baby doesn't scrunch down and the head rest keeps his head up.They also worked well for collecting drool, always a bonus.PS: All of the parts launder well.No shrinkage.Swaddling is making a comeback and what better way to do it than with these soft, 100% cotton blankets.These can be used for other purposes besides swaddling too.The price doesn't seem too outrageous (paying less than $8-$10 for a good quality blanket seems reasonable.My main gripe is the price.I just really didn't think it was that cute.Ha - maybe I'm jaded - I think ALL baby clothes, etc, are overpriced...!I really needed this for the straws from Camelbak water water bottles plus my kids straw cups - I kept finding them at the bottom of the dishwasher, they don't stay in the regular toddler basket.The adult water bottle straws have to go in at an angle, they're too long but they still fit OK.  Also, regular chopsticks are too long to fit, but the kids starter chopsticks do fit sideways.The inside top attachment (the green row) keeps falling off, though.It stays on once you close it but I have to fiddle with it every time I load it again so I took one star away.Very cute paci clip!Although, The velcro that attaches to the pacifier is thick, so it will only work well with pacis with handles!They stay put when we clip them on, even when our kids pull on them.We haven't had any problems with the velcro that other people commented on.They're perfect for toddlers and older kids.We've had the cups for several days now and haven't had one spill.Because of the shape it seems difficult to knock over.My 5 yr old wanted these cups and i was happy to buy them.She always wants me to buy sippy cups and i feel she is too old.She has a baby brother which makes all this growing up stuff even harder.My toddler has been using these cups since 10 months.They are easy to hold for small hands, bright colors, plastic (throw-proof!We are attempting to teach him to drink from a regular cup, as opposed to his sippy cups.The first day he had these cups he actually spent his time stacking and unstacking them- inadvertently becoming a toy.I think he will use these for quite some time to come.Besides, do you really want your child cruising around with a huge cup of liquid?If you are looking for a first time cup for your toddler, these are great.I purchased these cups to have more unbreakable options around for my 16 month old and 3 year old.I have been mostly pleased with the product, but I wish they were a little thicker/heavier.They spill pretty easy becuase they are so thin and light.I've seen thicker paper cups.So: good size, shape for kids- bad heft, tippy, and slightly slippery texture.Not quite as I expected.Next time I will be willing to spend money on a little more quality.The only thing I would like is for them to offer sippy lids that you could use with them.I was expecting these to be much larger than they actually are (about 2" across) - but with that being said, they DO work!I have one in my kitchen trashcan, one in the Diaper Genie, and one in my car as an air freshener.The packaging says they last for 90 days so we'll see how it goes.I found them cheaper than Amazon's list price locally ($5 on sale at Kmart), so it may not hurt to look around.I have two in the diaper pail and one each in the diaper bag, laundry bag, and on the changing table.It would have been nice if each one was individually sealed so it was possible to use one at a time.Although I do think they have improved the smells coming from the diaper pail, because of the way these are packaged, I will not buy them again.If you don't mind having to use all five at one time then I would recommend this product.I bought these for our trashcan in our toddlers room that frequently has poopy dipes in it.They didn't emit any smell and therefore didn't help the problem.Waste of money.These are great for the diaper bag, baby closet, drawers, and anything NOT in contact with baby poop.These are just not big enough to make a dent in the odor of the diaper pail.We take out the diaper pail daily, so we are not being lazy and reaping stink as our reward, these discs are simply too small for that kind of challenge.These are smaller than I thought they would be, but work very well.I hope they last 90 days as promised.I got these to try out because my doctor's office doesn't allow us to throw away wet diapers in the exam rooms, but they always want our newborn in a dry diaper.Since it's a 35 minute drive to their office, she is inevitably wet every time.So I keep one of these in the diaper bag, and also use theMunchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Bag Dispenser, Assortedbaggies, and I never worry about my diaper bag smelling fowl, even if it's only for a 35 minute drive back home.Added Oct 20:  3 months later, these are STILL fresh.I haven't replaced any of them in my diaper bags, hamper or diaper pale.These DEFINITELY last 90 days as promised, and today, they still smell like they did on day 1.They've helped everything stay fresher.I will be buying these again, once the first pack finally wears off.Maybe we introduced it too late (around 5 mos) but the moment he saw a real book he stopped playing with this thing.This rattle toy is adorable- and the hands are very tempting to teeth with.The hook is useful too- although I did have a hard time figuring out exactly what to hook it to since it isn't that big/long.But if your kid loves Elmo as much as mine does, definitely get this!Even at the lowest height, the crib is at least a foot off the ground.I read the negative review about not being able to find a mattress or sheets that fit.I ordered a mattress and sheets from Amazon and they fit perfectly.I knew that portable crib mattresses are very flimsy so I didn't expect to use it anyway.I bought these so my daughter could wear her "Dora Panties" all the time, instead of pull ups.The actual cover is a little big - but I guess that gives you the option to use them with a traditional cloth diaper.The legs are a bit snug (she's a slim 2T) but I just stretched them out a bit before putting them on and she doesn't seem to mind.They certainly contain accidents and are very thin - not bulky under clothes at all.I wouldn't recommend for over nights though, as they have made her sweat more during naps.Overall good buy.We use these every day :-)Love this product,didn't really know what I was ordering for my 16 mo at the time, but it is awesome!Doesn't make a sound and protects beyond belief!These do the trick, haven't had any leaks.Wish I had nylon.I had to stitch the bands around the belly and leg holes to make it fit my newborn (plan to remove the stitches as baby grows) but still the diaper itself is like a balloon.I like these covers.They work well and don't add extra bulk.Now that my daughter no longer has runny newborn poo, I actually prefer these to my expensive Thirsties covers.(I never thought I'd say that.)However, the sizing is odd.The newborn size didn't fit my baby until she was 12 pounds - and most of her weight is on the bottom.If it wasn't for the sizing being confusing, I'd give these a 5 star.especially for the price.My 10 month old soaks through every diaper.Thought I would try thick cloth diapers, but to no avail.Must have some sort of vinyl cover to go over.I can't stand the vinyl covers since they don't breathe.i wouldnt have review this product except that i saw only 1 other review which gave it 1 star!its not that bad!i bought a set of dappi, which incl 10 prefolds (only good  as burp cloths and doubler), 4 small nylon pull on covers (did not care for...i use the FLIP , thristies, or swaddlebees covers with flats) , and 6 dappi doublers.we it turns out that it was worth the money i spent!i still havent used the pants because a size small is actually still pretty big on my 20lb daughter!but onto the doublers...they fit PERFECT when oragami folding a 28x28 flat (little lions are great!)i lay the dappi over the center area and cover with fleece and snappi and go!These doublers are horrible!Not worth wasting the money on these.I got these mainly for the price, but these just didn't work for us and don't last as an overnight solution.I should of just paid a little more money and got something better.LOL.It's not over thought, yet well thought out.Features you will care about:#1.The cord wraps up under the device so that it doesn't hang out everywhere#2.Exactly the same tech as the Avent.#3.So you know exactly how much time you have beforeit is done.#6.The extra water container is a life saver, as you can replace water and clean the machine only once in a few usesrather than every use.Particularly useful when you're half asleep and only have enough energy to press the buttons.#7.This is actually also a good idea as again...it makes for one handed operation easier.#8.It doesn't shift around when you press the buttons.#9.Some reviewers said their products have mold and mildew.I had mine (two of them) for 3 and a half years and never had any foul smell or mold in the bottle warmer.I have always loosen the baby bottle so that pressure doesn't built inside the bottle that forces milk out of the nipple and spill into the warmer.I also warm milk in a bottle without the nipple, and just insert the cap/nipple when the milk is warmed.Once a while I forgot and milk could spill into the warmer and makes the reservoir cloudy.I just rinsed it off.When my son was done with bottle, I forgot to clean the water out.Just hard water.If you can do just this simple step, you will not have spill milk that causes cheesy rotten smell.It will save you the time and frustration of dealing with the cheaper ones.This warmer gets it right every single time.It is small and compact, lets you know warming is finished, remembers the previous warming times, and automatically adjusts the warming time if you're doing two bottles in a row, i.e.I went through 3 warmers, including the 1st years brand - they were both very aggravating to use and inconsistent.Honestly, this is the best buy out there.The countdown timer is also nice when your baby is screaming- to know how much longer he (and you!)have to endure before its ready.One tip: always follow the directions when it says to loosen the bottle neck before heating- if you don't the milk will leak into the water.[update: I decided to return this a month after I wrote the review]I don't like the water reservoir since it is difficult to clean due to the very small opening.Even after trying to clean it every few days I see some black spots inside...See the pictures I uploaded.I now operate this without the reservoir.I just pour a little water into the bottle warmer when I need to use it.This could have been so much better if they simply made the water reservoir easy to clean.I thought this was a good purchase but after three months of use it stopped working.Prior to not working properly, when it would work it leak terribly.It is a waste of money.It's never too hot or too cold because it goes by time not by how much water you put in.I like that I don't have to fill up the water at every bottle and that it remembers the last time.I used it to replace a Circo bottle warmer that was driving me crazy.The one thing about this warmer is that the times provided are inaccurate but once you figure out the time that work for you (which is recorded by the system) it is a life-saver.I haven't had any problems with leaking but I did have a small issue with the water reservoir clogging - it was my fault and once I cleaned it really well it worked like a charm.This bottle warmer is very useful.Once you have the times down, it is very consistent at temperature regulation.The only issue is that it does leak.But we have had to keep a towel under it to keep any leakage from contacting the electronics.I am not quite sure if I am doing something wrong or if there is indeed a flaw with this product.it's a good warmer to use if you have dr browns.It takes 5 minutes for a 4 oz bottle.Since it was taking so long we went to powder formula instead of waiting for the refrigerated ready made to be warmed.I got these to take on vacation after reading a few reviews about little kids locking themselves in the hotel bathroom.Yes, you should watch your child, and you can use towels over the door to keep the doors ajar, but this way we didn't have to worry about checking whether the towels on multiple doors had been removed by the cleaning staff, replacing them, etc.I also looked at plastic door knob covers but wasn't too keen on them, and couldn't be sure they'd fit well.Anyway, these are foam, very lightweight, and fit easily on several doors in our room that had push button door locks (which would be very interesting to our toddler).I saved them to bring on future trips - we'll be using them again soon.My 27 month old daughter was able to pry these covers off every door knob in our house.The device is made from cheap plastic and the locking mechanism is like putting a plastic egg together.I don't get how such an unsafe product is able to stay on the market.Guaranteed your child will out wit this door knob cover.I have used her larger one but it was difficult for me to load into and out of my truck (3 back surgeries.)I just received this and put it together in 5 minutes.The only trouble I had figuring out the assembly was trying to open it because the instructions were, duh, in the folded up seat!Only real assembly is snapping the front wheels on (once you figure out how to open it!)I am 5-ft, 5 inches tall and the top part of the handles are 36-inches high.If the handles had been any lower I would have returned this as I would have to bend forward to use it.* *UPDATE on March 9, 2011* *  Still like it for the price but have experienced a problem with the front wheels.They do that "shopping-cart thing" where one side doesn't want to go in the same direction as the other.But ya can't beat the price even if it has some relatively minor issues!One of the bad things about it, is the wheels.Sometimes they turn in opposite directions and it causes the stroller to stop, even if you're just walking straight.Plus it doesn't come with an umbrella and finding an umbrella for it is extremely difficult.Otherwise it's not too bad, it does the job, plus the giraffe design is very cute!Can't beat the price under $20.I'm 5' 1" and I feel the arms are about one to two inches too short to be completely comfortable for me to push and steer.It's perfect for someone five feet tall, max.I think this is the first time I've actually had to say, "I'm too tall for this."I will modify the handles and update this review.For now, I don't mind using it for short trips as we have two other strollers and my kid likes to walk sometimes.Recommend for people 5 feet and under to handle comfortably.It won't matter whether you use it correctly and snap close the 2 pieces.We bought this mostly to use it at the beach but also used it a handful of times on the grass.It has a good weight to it so it doesn't blow around.It's also pretty soft so it adds a little padding to the ground.It's very easy to fold even with little arrows and markings about how to do it so you can't forget.The blanket component of this product is excellent.It is easy (for the most part) to fold back up into the carrying sack as well.You can carry it by hand, shoulder style, messenger style or backpack style - basically, whatever way is most comfortable.It is convenient for picnics, soccer games, or any activity you might spend on a lawn.The cooler component of the bag seems to be something of an afterthought.It does not expand much, so you can pretty much fit only a few sippies and maybe a sandwich or two (it is not too padded, so be sure to place squishables in a plastic or metal container).There are no interior or exterior pockets on the cooler either - a pocket for ice might have been nice.When objects are placed in bag, bag takes on a lumpy appearance (again, it just isn't big enough).The front and back have minimal insulation, and the sides are not insulated insulated at all.It will keep things cool for only about 1-2 hours.Really, if the cooler bag was just a bit deeper/wider and had better insulation (or an ice pocket), it might be more useable.It is probably best as a bag to store a few diapers/wipes, a coloring book, wallet and keys instead.It would also be good storage for sunscreen and maybe a few sippies full of water if you are planning a trip to the beach.I do appreciate that it is PVC and BPA-free.I am almost exclusively pumping and these really soothe my nipples well.My daughter much prefers it over this one.It's a good cup, and I would buy it again for another baby who might like it more.This sippy cup is quite simply THE BEST one around.I have tried many, many cups, ranging from cheap to expensive and this is the ONLY one that does not leak at all (not a drop!)AND my child can suck the liquid out easily.The only other ones that I have found not to leak are the ones with the crazy valve that requires all human strength to get a drop out of, which to me is totally unusable.We always end up either making the hole in the valve much bigger, which causes it to leak, or take the valve out altogether, which really causes it to leak!I let my daughter roam all over the house with it since I know it will not drip or if there is juice or milk inside, I know it will not create a sticky, smelly mess.I'm planning on buying at least one more of these.The one we ordered from Amazon arrived with a blue cup portion, purple handles, and a green lid ... not what was pictured, but still fine with us.They haven't leaked.It has a LOT of cushion and keeps baby nice and snug in their carseat.The cushion is so thick that they grow out of it quickly, but is perfect for a newborn!Fits in the car seat perfectly and description says it can be used up to 5 years old.The white part is fluffy and more for winter, the other side is cotton, better in the summer.I bought this as a new mom.Didn't realize most newborn car sears already have an insert like this so it's not really necessary.I did not use this in a car seat.I did however use this for my son in his Fisher Price Rock and Play Sleeper when he was just born.The product itself is very soft and high quality.It's nice that the head part detaches so you can use it as your baby grows.If you are a new mom and think you will need this for a car seat... buy your car seat first and see if it already comes with one!I got this bag as a gift when I was pregnant.I was excited about having a stylish diaper bag that could double as my purse.When I got it I noticed it was HUGE.It fits everything so well!And you can't tell by the picture but the way the zipper part is done you can load the bag up to the rim and not have an issue zipping it.I carry my wallet and car keys etc in that and if I drop baby off at grandma's I leave the main bag and just take the little purse with my stuff in it.Again, genius design.I love it a lot BUT THERES A HUGE BUT ... the bag is not nearly as sturdy as it needs to be for this purpose.Right when I got it one handle started falling apart.Now after 3 months use the inside buckle has ripped and the thermal bottle holder has fallen apart and ripped.I'm so sad about this.I wish it was made a bit sturdier.They thought of everything for the bag why didn't they think that lugging this big bag around requires something that can handle a little more wear-and-tear?the patter options arent extensive, but when you need a MT, you need a MT...function before cuteness.it does pick up a lot of dust and pet hair and lint.the black definitely shows my dogs fur ALL over it, but thats why they make lint rollers.its very functional and i feel very comfortable putting my daughter in it and knowing shes safe.im comfortable wearing her for hours, and shes comfortable enough that she fell asleep on my back while i did laundry today without whining.and i can get SO much done around the house, now!like i said the shoulder straps are wide.just kinda looks off.the part that supports baby is, also, wide...itd be GREAT for chunky babies and toddlers, maybe not newborns or babies younger than 3 months.even for my 7m old, it bunches a lil under her heiny because its wide.she can still move her arms in and out of the carrier sides, but if im not within 3 inches of something at her hand height [which i never am,] she cant get it.:) but she doesnt whine, she loves the view and that mommys holding her!:)the carrier needs some getting used to with tying and positioning.basically, like all things, it comes with a learning curve.but its been a week for me, and ive got it down packed.[i always still tie her on my back while standing over the bed or sofa JUST IN CASE.]overall, this is a great carrier.it has its down sides, but theyre minimal and dont affect comfort or function.I got this after my slingrider was recalled.So far we have a love hate relationship with this.The black and the type of fabric picks up everything so it gets dirty very fast and it shows very easily.I was thinking this would be great for traveling but once I got it the ties are long and it's hard trying to fit it into a diaper bag when not in use, and it takes up a great deal of space.If it had a carry bag for when it's not in use that would have been nice.Few things I like:1. feels good on, doesn't hurt my back like other carriers2.baby seems happyFew things I don't:1. fabric is like a swiffer, picks up a ton of dust and after only two days and wearing it twice it already needs to be washed.It shows everything!2.prints to choose from aren't as attractive as those used for the slingrider, the material was better too it didn't attract a ton of dust.I would have chosen the khaki but looking at the print for a while gave me a headache.3.I was unable to stay indoors constantly with my newborn (Errands need to be run and my oldest NEEDED to get out of the house) I bought this when my baby was 1wk old (7lbs 3oz) and being able to be hands free is amazing!I am able to wear it around the house and get simple chores done (folding laundry, washing dishes, etc) and she falls asleep in it almost instantly!It makes putting my 2yr old in her carseat much easier and she feels that she's getting one on one attention with the little one in the wrap!The longest I've worn it is 3 hours and my back didn't hurt.I love that I don't feel like a hunchback when I'm wearing it and that it doesn't require readjustment after every movement!UPDATE:My youngest is now 14 months and still loves to be worn.I have a couple other carriers but this is her favorite.through the park while she is in it.;) I tell everyone who asks me about it (in the grocery store, on play dates, out with friends) that it is by far the best $30 I've ever spent!These are great spoons, but they are just a little to short to reach into a stage 2 baby food jar without getting food all over your hands.Perhaps that is not their intention, I'm not sure.Other than that, the spoons are very nice.My daughter really liked the deep bowls to the spoons.Since she needs more spoons than forks, I purchased these spoons since they look similar.If you want shallow bowls, these may be just what you are looking for.i love that they are a safe plastic, better alternative to bamboo or stainless steel utensils.everything in the dinnerware set, is the same as what you buy individually for feeding.since it is made from #2 recycled plastic, it is food safe.so whether your children are playing or eating with it- they are safe.if you want to save some money just order the dinnerware set and use the dishes, bowls and eating utensils- instead of ordering individually.then let your child play with them after they are washed.They are made of the same recycled plastic as their toys so they seem really sturdy.I have returned hem because I found they were a bit wide for my infant's mouth at the time.I think they would make better pretend utensils or they would be good for feeding a toddler.I really loved this carrier - for MYSELF.It makes carrying my 17 pound baby SO easy!He just keeps slipping down and getting more uncomfortable.We've tried 3 carriers now, and the one he likes best is the Baby Bjorn Air Carrier.It's harder on my back, but he's the most comfortable in it.I did look up several videos on how to wrap the Mei Tai, and tried following them.I still had all the issues listed above.Wish it had worked for us, because it was expensive.If you're interested, try borrowing one first.I ended up returning this product because after setting it up and using it the video quality was very poor--not something I would expect with the price.The only thing I did like about this monitor was the size because the hand held portion was very slim.I also didn't realize that once you set up the video portion you cannot change the position of it from the hand held so if your baby moves you must come in to adjust it.I ended up spending a few more dollars and getting the "best view" by Summer from Amazon which confirmed how horrible the video quality was on this one because the quality on the other model was 100% better.I would recommend trying a different model if video quality is what you are looking for (and if you are buying a video monitor I'm sure that's important!!!I previously had the Suummer Infant handheld monitor with a 1.8" screen and it worked great other than occasional static.While the daytime vision is pretty clear, night time vision is nearly worthless.I placed the camera in the exact same spot where I had my previous camera and I can't see anything at night whereas the night vision from the cheaper set was very clear.Very annoying and I didn't have this problem with the previous one either.All in all I'm disappointed that I didn't just get an extra camera for the one I had...this one definitely isn't worth the money.Update two years later: So the monitor just stopped working at 11 months.I was disappointed but got lucky we were still within the warranty period.I'm downgrading my review from 5 to 4 since this happened, but I still think it gets a 4 because the company was very responsive.Not only did they send me a new one, but they sent me a better model with two cameras.This is our first baby monitor.We bought this monitor after reading extensive reviews.So far, so good.Bonus: you can add up to 3 additional cameras and there is a "talk" button so you can talk to your child without entering the room.I'm not sure about the battery life or how long this unit will last (I'm hoping years and years), so I can't rate it based on that, but I love everything else.My toddler is afraid of being alone in the dark and this purchase helped with his sleep problems.I got my 16 month old son the quarter moon night light.He loves it and waits for me to turn it on for him after I put him in his crib each night.He watches it til he goes to sleep.He also likes to carry it around with him and play with it.Thank you for this great and super cute invention!My friends had one for their son (2.5yrs) and gave rave reviews.It automatically turns itself off after several minutes.We have had no issues with battery life, even when it is off the base for a couple days.The moon is for my 6 month old.She holds it, but doesn't yet know how to turn it on and off.These lights are very bright!I use it when I am caring for my littlest daughter without waking daddy.I love them for when we have finished story reading and we are transitioning to my leaving the room.I can see where I need to step.No issues at all.Just positive things to report.I haven't found that at all and we have used it like a toddler would.No problem!She was breastfed until 15 months but started getting cow's milk at one year via bottle.We were very worried that at 18 months, our daughter would have a hard time getting rid of the bottle.We failed with several other cups (some with straws, some without).We have never looked back.I used Thirsties.These covers worked okay, however my child was always leaking out of them, especially at night.It was so frustrating to wake up in the morning to find my daughter laying in pee!When our second daugther was born this past March, I discovered that kissaluvs had come out with a the Marvel diaper cover.I cannot even begin to describe to you what an amazing diaper cover this is.Not only is it very durable and easy to use (I especially love that it has snaps and not velcro), my daughter has not leaked out of it once.Several nights ago she slept for 12 hours straight and although her diaper was saturated, the Marvel diaper cover held it all in.No pee leaked out at all!In fact two nights ago I got my diaper cover mixed up and put one of the thirsties on and sure enough she leaked pee out all over the sheets!I am now getting rid of all my thirsties so I no longer make that mistake when changing her diaper.Do yourself a favor and try them out -  they are by far the best cover on the market.Wool covers are my favorite covers by far.The other one I own has never leaked.My son is a very heavy wetter too.These wool things are bulletproof.The fit is very comfy too.He's very active now and he can move around in these with no problem.They're very cute and soft.I absolutely love these wool covers.It's so soft and thick, but not at all bulky.Haven't had any leaks.But you won't get leaks from these, unless you don't lanolize it periodically.It does gap in the legs a bit, but as long as the prefold is covered, it's not a problem.I wish I just purchased these covers with maybe one PUL cover in each size range because these are the ones I use most.I recommend purchasing two of these bags as they take a while to line dry and you'll find yourself wondering where to put your dirty diapers while you wait for the bag to dry.If you want a pail liner that stays in place and works great, this is it.It also holds a lot of diapers.It will hold basically my whole stash of 12 prefolds, 6 covers, 6 AIOs, and 4 SoftBums shells with 12 pods and 6 doublers.Of course they've never all been dirty at once, but I think this liner would hold every last one.I ordered two of these when I began cloth diapering.I like them a lot.The pail is unable to close with the liner inside.I had to return them and will look for a hanging wet bag instead.I love this diaper pail liner.The material is thick, waterproof, and does not wick.It even has a little patch of fleece sewed on inside if you want to add some essential oil to mask the odor.It dries easily in the dryer on low but requires some time drying on the line (needs to be flipped inside-out to get both sides dry) -so you will need two bags to alternate between.Not a big problem, but now I see why other waterproof PUL bags are colored and not white.Also, diapers that make their way into it during the wash cycle will not be washed well.HINT - We realized that the diapers slide out a lot easier if we put the liner with the cloth side on the inside and the rubbery side on the outside.Don't bother with more expensive liners - I've tried them all and this one is the best.I love the elastic opening as it fits snugly in any diaper pail or garbage pail.It does not interfere with the pail lid.It doesn't drop into the pail like those bags with the useless drawstring openings.It fits just like a standard plastic garbage bag, only without the waste.When it's full just toss it in the washer with your diapers and you're good to go!This is a great option for a basic pail liner!It's made of the same materials and was a great price- I would definitely recommend this.I might get another one for upstairs, too.In one of them, the seam is completely coming undone at the bottom.I am so frustrated that I paid $15 for a bag that is now useless after just over a month.When I first started cloth diapering, this pail liner wasn't invented yet.I just got to try it first hand and can I just say that I think its one of the best pail liners out there.Not only is it antibacterial (which in itself is awesome), but the pail liner can hold PLENTY of diapers and holds in the smell very well.In fact, when bringing the diapers to the laundry room to be washed, I don't even smell much of an odor.Do yourself a favor and buy this pail liner.They have priced this liner much lower than most other ones that I have seen and it works the best!I bought this to line a kitchen size waste bin with lid to use for a diaper pail.Washed it several times and seems to be like new after three weeks.I got this after reading a review on my favorite cloth diapering blog, and was pleased to find it meeting expectations.It would get 5 stars if it had a drawstring top or something, but I might be missing the point in my "I've been a mom for 4 weeks" haze.I'm still disorganized enough it just sits on the floor, not in a pail, and I can't see how it'd keep the smell down when it's used as pictured (maybe with a tightly lidded pail).Anyway, it's thick and durable.I throw diapers into it for 2 days -- even 3 days one time -- and there is absolutely no smell (newborn, breastfed).When I dump the bag into the wash, or if I open it, I do get some damp fishy smell but that seems about right since it doesn't clean the diapers themselves :-)  My brag is that none of that smell escapes the bag.Not even when I open the top to toss the new diaper in.I'd suggest two, for sure: one in use, one in the wash.Now ... do they make a wet bag from the same material?Its not too wet and still moist enough to wipe off the mess.This is what we wanted and these wipes certainly fit our bill nicely.Also, I recommend skipping getting plastic dispenser all together.Especially when Amazon sells them by the bulk.Less plastic waste please.If you really want one, just buy a single dispenser one or some generic dispenser from your local stores.Unscented, yeah right!I even put the wipes in a ziploc bag (while they were still in the original disposable pouch) and they still stunk up my diaper bag!I was hesitant to buy these because some of the reviews said they smelled weird.I bought a pack from the grocery store and didn't find that they smelled weird so I ordered some on Amazon.We like them a lot!While I don't love the fact that they decreased the quantity or size, I won't speak to any issues of less product for a given dollar amount - I will just review the product itself.Their moisture level seems good to me, not dripping wet (and leaving behind a soapy foam on the skin) or too dry.They may be smaller than others (I don't know), but I mostly use them for breastmilk poops anyway right now, so it's not like I could use the same one for a second pass most of the time anyway.:P  One thing I love is that they separate from each other easily with one hand, which is quite necessary when dealing with a flailing baby and a big mess.Another brand we've used will not separate at the perforations, and I need to open the lid fully to yank them apart with two hands, leading to a big mess when I let go of the baby's hands.They clean well, smell okay, and have fairly decent if not fabulous ingredients.These really are the best chlorine-free diapers (and chlorine diapers) I've tried and I've tried several (every brand I come across).We had started using the ones that comes in the white reusable containers but found it was easier to use the "refill" (for lack of a better term) packaging instead.Although it was more plastic garbage than I had hoped (5-70 count refill packs) it works well b/c you can keep your stock nice & damp.I got this snot sucker based on the other Amazon reviews and I have not been disappointed.My daughter recently came down with her first cold and I found myself in need of a good snot sucker.Once you use it, though, you realize that you would have to collect a lot of mucus in the large tube before it would even reach the filter and tubing.I haven't used a motorized aspirator, but it seems like the Nosefrida would have the advantage of having more suction (at least when I do it) and it doesn't have a noisy motor.One thing that I love about this aspirator is that you can see all the mucus you get in the tube.Sounds gross, but it is very satisfying to see all the progress you've made and to know that you've removed it from your poor baby's nose.Then it is very easy to clean- just remove the collection tube from the smaller tubing, run under warm water, and a little soap.Done.My daughter hates the aspirator, of course.She's a baby- this is to be expected.So I don't base my review of this product on her reaction.After trying day after day to relieve my son of his congestion via the blue ball we got from the hospital, I needed something better.The blue ball aspirator didn't get everything (not even close!)The Nosefrida is easy to take apart and clean, too.Although he tolerated the blue hospital aspirator, I didn't like having to stick it up his nose so much and what I was trying to suck out was pretty thick, not runny so I had to go up there several times each time.So when I found this I was excited to try it.And because you control it with your own mouth, you can suction it for as long as you need to as opposed to having to pull it out and start over as you do with the aspirator.A friend of mine is a pediatric ENT and he recommends this product.I feel much better about when I need to clear his nasal passages now that I am not putting anything in his nose.I would recommend it!No, seriously, just buy this thing.It sounds gross but WOW does it work.The bulb syringe just pisses the baby off and does absolutely nothing in terms of clearing their nose.This thing also pisses my baby off, but it actually gets the snot out.Many mom friends of mine have rejected the thought of this thing until their little one gets all stuffed up -- then they call me "What was the name of that thing?Disgusting, but oh so satisfying.I wish I had one of these with my older two kids.The other thing is that I never felt like the bulb syringe was clean.Just buy it.It was shipped quickly and accurately.The bag has a large main compartment that is sealed with a lining to keep the wet in.This item would also be great for a swimmer that needs to store a suit and towel after practice/ a meet.It's large enough to fit the whole families suits inside.It's good looking, for sure!I have been using the bag for about a week now and I would have to say that it is doing a good job so far.It keeps the smell in pretty well between washings.The handle is helpful- I have it hanging on a door knob.I suppose that extra pocket could be used when traveling to store clean items or a change of clothes.All in all: I think this is a well made and useful item to have if you have wet items that you need to store.I like this product, with one exception...On the plus side, it is beautiful-looking, holds a decent amount of diapers and hangs well on the knob of the door.Basically works as advertised.On the downside... well, laundering it is a royal pain.Turning it inside out into the washer is a bit trickier, and after it's been through the washer, it turns itself halfway back right-side-in.So when I take it out of the washer, I have a big 'bag of water' that I have to hang over my utility sink and watch it slowly seep out of the fabric bottom.It takes quite a while to dry this way and usually drips all over the floor getting it out of the washer.(I don't put PUL fabric into the dryer as a rule of thumb, so I'm not sure how that would fare; but I wouldn't want to put that much water in the dryer anyway!)Will it stop me from using it?Nope-- But I wish I had known that was going to happen before getting water all over.I wish I had come across these bags when I first started using the diapers since they are so much better about holding the smell in than using plastic grocery bags in a foot pedal trash can...not to mention so much more eco friendly.The smell isn't completely unnoticeable (especially since my son's diapers are some of the worst I've ever smelled - working in childcare for 17 years, I've smelled quite a few), but the smell is A LOT less than it was.It's a great product as well as the garbage can itself!!Very durable, easy to fill in!!!It's the best thing ever.The bags are easy to change, and b/c of the design I can empty the diaper pail as often as I feel I need to, without wasting an entire bag.However, I rarely find I need to empty it before it's full, since the only time you get whiff of it is when it's open to throw another diaper out.And even then, it's not bad.The bags are sturdy and don't rip despite the weight they sometimes get to before being emptied, or the various other things (sometimes pointy and sharp-ish) that get thrown in there.We have two of these diaper decors (one for upstairs, one for down).Now after one diaper his room smells awful.I'm guessing it is the bags that are supposed to deodorize in some way and these are not doing the trick anymore.We have to empty his diaper pail daily (maybe that is a reality for everyone) when we used to have to empty it every 3 days (or so).of the diaper waste hasn't changed so we are not sure what happened.I actually use it for cloth diapers (and then throw the plastic bag away after I empty the dirty diapers into the washing machine).I hate that it feels a bit wasteful, but these bags really keep the stink of the diapers under control.I am the ever prepared type and tend to have a lot of "extra" stuff around the house.I mean like soaps, shampoo, toothpaste, toothbrushes, etc.This is one of those products that you should be prepared for.I am not in any way saying that this product is bad, but the company could somehow prepared the person that they are at the end or nearing.You know how on cash registers the paper on it has red lines to let you know you have to be prepared?If I wasn't the type of person that was always prepared, I would be mad at myself if I had to go out and buy this.I buy this at Amazon, because if I didn't, I would have to go across town (about 35 minutes away) to replenish this product and that is if they have it.Not so convenient to me, but it might be convenient for you.I do think that the bags are nice and keep the smells in and overall it is a good product.However I gave it only 4 stars, because the company could improve the product, at least a little to make it easier to know when you need to buy more.For those that want the bio-degradable one, they really do sell them on this site.They are about 2 dollars more.The continuous bag system is pretty easy to use as long as you are comfortable tying knots in plastic, but I find it annoying that the system doesn't include an indicator near the end of the "roll" to prompt the timely purchase of a refill.This seemed like such a great idea.I was so excited to try it.When I got i out of the box I noticed how cheap the material was.It was a sheer T-shirt material that wasn't even very stretchy.I tried to bf with it and my baby kept grabbing it completely exposing me!Save your $.These were $4.99 with free shipping when I ordered them, which seems to be pretty good compared to other brands that ran up to $10.00+.Nice & soft and they do the trick for making sure the straps don't cut into my baby's neck and they even help support her head when she falls asleep in the car.They are also reasonably priced.Would buy this again.They're cute for a little guy's car seat and helps protect his little neck from getting cut into by his seat straps.I do think they have a little too much cushion though.So worth the money - usually they're double the price.All in all, a great buy :)I bought these for my infants carseat as the strap covers that came with it were very skimpy.I will plan to use them when baby gets bigger as they are very cute and soft.My husband and I purchased these for our second child after using a similar sort of thing for our first baby.He wraps his little arms around them and snuggles into them while in his seat, and uses them as little pillows at times.They stayed in place and are very soft.These cute little strap covers fit perfectly in my baby's car seat.When we first used it, it was very obvious that it didn't fit properly.The strap covers were so big and long that they kept the clip from getting to armpit level.Now that he's grown 6-7 months later and is out of the bucket seat, this product no longer interferes with the clip.I purchased these for my new baby grandson.I had noticed that every time his mommy put him in his care seat, he complained and the straps seemed to be digging into his shoulders... then I saw these strap covers!What an absolutely clever idea.They're so soft and snuggley against his head, so well that he falls fast to sleep and never complains anymore for getting strapped in his carseat.And they come in pink, blue, or tan.Enjoy...I know my grandson is!!They are a great idea, but they were just to thick for my use.As well as not grabbing onto little ones clothes!Nice idea, but could use some modifications.Soft fabric though.These are durable, soft and stays in place.They have even helped keep my daughters head in place while sleeping from infancy to toddler age.Let me begin by saying that it is durable, lightweight (as compared to other sippy cups), and is for a range of age.The side curved handles are removable which means that a child can use it as a toddler and continue to use it through childhood.The side handles offer a good grip and are designed for little hands.My niece is six-month old and still drinks from the smaller nipple sizes on her bottles.However, this sippy cup has four holes on top, which makes it easier for her to drink the liquid.It is indestructible - won't break when thrown to the floor.Hurray!No fade!The price is higher, for one of these,If you compare just costs, not ease,But in the end, just use your smarts:Removable handles!I've never had a kid that needed to use those, and have always found them annoying, especially the ones that aren't removable.Best "feel" of any of the sippies that we have gone through with two kids (and there have been many)The open wing type handles make it easy for little hands to grasp.Level bottom and tight lid keeps it from spilling.My grandchild did very well with it and even when "playing" with it, nothing spilled out.Mine was orange/red, not aqua.If you are using it for formula, it may throw you off because formula in the US is measured out in 2, 4, 6, 8, etc.ounces.It has no cover for travel !!!!!!To me( and I think most moms ) it is important for travel so there is no leaking and top stays clean !!Also good for when in fridge just in case it falls over.These things happen more than you think and aluminum foil just doesn't cut it nior does  cling wrapHowever for homeIt's one  of the few that are all dishwasher safeParts come out and fit back in easilyIt is very sturdy and well madeThe removable handles are nice and located strategically at the bottom and helps avoid knock overs by toddlersOverall for home use onlyit is well made and safe and practical plus easy to use and cleanNo BPAHowever I am very much a cover for the top personI need to be be able to get a drink in a cup,  cover, put in bag, grab JR and GO!!!So I had to minus 2 for the lack of a cover.I NEED theseBUT if you don't  then this is well made and a good dealShe usually takes takes a drink and then flings onto the ground.For whatever reason she does not do that with the OXO Tot Sippy cup.In fact, she takes the cup and arches her back and takes big long drinks.My only guess is that she likes that the tops of the handles are open.However, maybe there is something with how her water flows out of this cup.Things we can report- Our daughter loves it- No leaks or spills (to date)- Easy to take apart and clean- Colorful (ours is red)- It is clear so it is easy to see what your child is drinking and how much remains in the cup.- At full price this is a pretty expensive sippy cup!Final Verdict - I don't ask why, but OXO Tot Sippy cup is now the main thing that our daughter will drink out of.... go figure!5 StarsShe's definitely in that transitional period where that this cup is designed for!This cup:- is easy to take a part to clean- is dishwasher safe- has parts that easily swivel to help busy moms get the drink in the kids hands- has some very nice grippers on each side- hasn't leaked on me yet and Nickie LOVES throwing her cups aroundI actually haven't found any flaws in this cup.It serves its purpose and does so with a sleek, colorful, leak free design!Important when a kid has wet or goopy hands, they can still hold onto the cup.The handles also come off the bottom of the cup, not so easily that a toddler could pull it off though.The benefit of this is that when they are older and don't need the handles, they can easily be removed.The rubber piece is removable, as wella s the lid and the handles for easy washing.I have purchased other OXO products in the past, and all met and exceeded my expectations.Not only were they inexpensive when compared to comparable products, but they in many cases were superior in quality.This sippy cup is no exception.I have tried many types of sippy cups with varying degrees of success and failure but this one is a winner.They designed this cup to be everything to everyone!1.The actual spigot part where the liquid comes out has a rubber stopper with two positions, completely closed and then another that only lets liquid through when someone intentionally sucks through the nozzle.You can turn it upside down and it will not leak.The handles are removable.OXO really thought of everything with this one.UPDATE:This sippy cut lasted less than 2 months.The handle kept getting more loose, until it came off completely.And it leaked.I was excited to get it at first, but it was too frustrating so we got rid of it.=====Pros:*BPA-Free (never let your child near plastics that are not BPA-free, especially little boys)*Two-handled*Handles remove, to convert into grip-able cup*Valve is good, easy to remove for faster flowCons:The only real problem is that the handles don't snap or lock into place.So they slide around the cup, sometimes covering up the nozzle.Durable, dishwasher friendly and just plain attractively shaped they are my go-to brand for kitchen gadgets and such.When I saw they were making stuff for feeding babies and toddlers I was stoked.Decided to try out the sippy cup since it was offered to me through Vine.Unfortunately they sent me the wrong color first off.I got orange and it is an ugly orange.Then I noticed the ounces are labeled in odd numbers.As in 3, 5, 7... instead of 2, 4, 6... which makes no sense.Formula is usually measured in 2's so I disliked the labeling immediately.The hard plastic of the cup scratches easily, the handle is so weirdly placed my little one will only hold it backwards so I had to take it off.What I do like about the cup is the valve system.Easier to take out and put back, easier to clean.Both for myself and the little one those grippy sides have been handy (no pun intended).She likes to chew the spouts a little (yay teething!)and this one doesn't let her do that at all, too hard.Your child may not mind but mine won't drink from one she can't squeeze a little between those new teeth.Overall I think it's an okay cup but nothing special.It did get me interested in what other toddler products they have so I will be sure to check them out.I also really like that the handles come off and on and it's really easy to clean.The spout comes out and you can toss the whole thing in the dishwasher.This is a great cup and the whole interchangeable system is a neat idea.I love orange, and this looked cool, so i order it.BUT:1 - it leaks.I've tried everything, but it just doesn't keep a seal and water leaks where you screw the top on.2 - while the handles coming from the bottom LOOKS cool, its not.I can't put this sippy cup in the cup holder in my stroller, or any cup holder for that matter.and you can't even "hook" it on something which is what i do w the other handle sippy cups sometimes.very poor design, don't order it.He's been using sippy cups since he was 8 months old and he cannot get the liquid out of this cup.So it's basically useless to me.The removeable handles are a nice design feature, however the inside of the handle got spaghetti sauce on it and it's now stained on the inside and it won't come off.Also, the company talks about how all the parts are inter-changeable so the cup can grow with your child......but you can't buy the extra parts without getting a completely new cup.Since the valve doesn't work, I don't even have the option to turn this into a training cup for him.....so again, another waste.I'm a HUGE OXO fan and have their products throughout my entire house, but they missed the mark with these cups!!Definitely doesn't leak, but design has some issues......Summary: A decent sippy cup with benefit of OXO design and options for interchangability.Some design flaws make it hard to recommend....With 3 kids at 2,4, and 6, we still have a TON of sippy cups.We use them most of all in the car since we hate to get water or juice on the upholstry.The lid has a seal where the bottom screws in and a pretty beefy valve which seems to stay put (so far)  The result is that it is more leak resistant than our de-facto standard, the Playtex sippy cups.What remains to be seen is the long term durability.The valves for the Playtex cups wear out regularly and if the cup is thrown or dropped the valve can pop out, which gives you major leaks.The BPA free clear body is nice and includes measuring marks.The handles are nice but prevent you from using the cup in a car seat cupholder.Many sippy cups have the handles attached at the top which don't cause this problem.One side effect to the valve design is that it is very hard to drink from the cup.Our 7 year old tried it out and complained that it was too hard to drink from.We also observed that our 2 year old drinks a lot less when using this cup - we attribute it to the higher effort to get liquids out.Update - after 4 weeks with this, our 2 year old decides she does not like it and refuses to use it.Playtex sippy cups are probably 95% as leak resistant, but apparently far easier to drink from.For that reason I have dinged this another star.I dinged it a star because of the handle and drinking effort.If you have any questions or comments, or if this review helped, please let me know!I was needing a new sippy cup for my 16 month old daughter and turned to the amazon reviews for help, so I always like coming back to give my thoughts.Has anyone noticed how freaking ugly sippy cups are?I like the valve in it, it like "clips" on instead of having to mash it in a hole.It wasn't a big deal to me so I still gave it 5 stars.Love OXO products!!***Updates as of 2-21-11***I really wanted to love these.I really just think the quality is lacking in this product, but they have hit some design aspects on the head.It looks great, you can easily see what is in it and how much, and it fits standard cup holders (of car seats/stroller/etc).And it didn't leak as long as the valve stayed on.We're using an ugly Gerber one now that we can't see through and doesn't fit cup holders, but as least it is tougher!He's been using sippy cups since he was 8 months old and he cannot get the liquid out of this cup.So it's basically useless to me.Also, the company talks about how all the parts are inter-changeable so the cup can grow with your child......but you can't buy the extra parts without getting a completely new cup.Since the valve doesn't work, I don't even have the option to turn this into a training cup for him.....so again, another waste.I'm a HUGE OXO fan and have their products throughout my entire house, but they missed the mark with these cups!!For this reason I wouldn't reccomend this cup for a child who can unscrew the lid.The lid does allow a decent amount of water to spill out, but it is a good step between a sippy cup and a regular cup.I had a little trouble telling from the picture, but the guard preventing the water from comming out is hard plastic.It snaps into place and I wouldn't expect to have a problem with it comming out too easily.My 20 month old son seems to like this cup alot and hasn't had as much of a problem getting too much water like he would with a regular cup.He has however tilted it up too high and ended up with a wet shirt.the transition lid seems like a good idea and i have not seen any other similar products with this lid.however, the sippy lid was too difficult to use.I have only hand washed the cup but I like the fact that it is top shelf dishwasher safe.Other bonuses are you can see through the cup if you have it on a surface, you know when you are getting to the bottom.It fits perfectly in my cars cup holder and I can just grab a bite without having to look away since the lid opening is so generous.The fact that it is BPA/PVC free I feel a lot better when using it with my daughter.Also, as someone else stated, this replaces those dreadful baggies.OXO is a trusted brand that I use in my kitchen already and they thought of everything with the snack sup.It is about the diameter of a can of soda/pop and 2.75 inches tall.On the packaging it says it is BPA- and PVC-free, which is definitely a concern with a plastic cup.[UPDATE 11/2010] We've found that the lid has opened and spilled a few times unintentionally.It can fit into purses and other small spaces without any problem, so it is handy for storage of small, bite- size portions.If I want to snack on, say, some peanuts, I don't think I would even bother using this container.The amount of peanuts I like to eat is about two to three times what would fit inside the Oxo Tot snack cup.One other problem with this cup- and this is probably the most significant- is the fact that the flip- top opens with relative ease.This has already happened to me, and it immediately brought attention to this flaw in the design.Overall, the Oxo Tot Flip- Top Snack Cup is a decent container but it does have restricted use and it does have a tendency to spill its contents when mishandled.It is good enough to recommend, but keep in mind that it is very small and its uses are limited.I bet baby would have no problem prying the lid off, because it easily came off while just transporting it in my bag, spilling the contents everywhere.You'll find dozens of similar products at the 99cent store, but will they be lead and toxin free?Overall, great quality, but the shoddy lid could have been designed better.As a mom of four children ages 8 down to 10 months, I can't get out the door without bringing some type of snack or drink in my bag.I do not use a traditional diaper bag because they are just too big.I just use my purse, but lately I find that my little baggies of pretzels or Cheerios become dust when sloshed around with my wallet, sun glass case, keys, etc...It has a flip top and so far it has not come open while sloshing around in the bottom of my bag.I haven't used it in that manner so I cannot comment on how well it works.I don't many gimmicky items gears towards moms and kids, but this one was a practical investment.I got this snack cup through the Amazon Vine program.The lip snaps open easily and my three year old son had no problems getting it open and shut.My son immediately tried to throw the cup across the room (thinking it was a ball that would be good for throwing) and the cup seems pretty durable; it didn't dent or crack or anything.There are a couple things that bothered me with the cup.The second thing is that the clear plastic feels and looks pretty cheap.The top opens too easily, probably meant for little hands to open and close with no problem but when your toddler drops it, contents will go everywhere.However, I really like it for my lunch.I'm very happy with this product but not so much as advertised for the toddler.Way to much of a mess waiting to happen.The clear plastic is a bit thin, I was expecting something like a nalgene bottle.It's only slightly more dense than a disposable water bottle.On the other hand, it holds up way better than my current strategy of using plastic ziploc snack bags for my kids' pretzels, crackers, cereal, etc.which tends to get crushed in my purse or diaper bag.Then again, the snack bags are much much cheaper.And I can toss them once we've eaten up all the snacks at the zoo/museum/library/grocery store/etc instead of having to bring an empty container home.In general, it's a cute concept.My kid much prefers eating from a cup container than a snack bag.But it's really a wash unless you have the disposable income.Can you live without it?If you have the money to spend on these sorts of things, then the bonus is that it's pvc, phalate, and bpa free.Yippee!After seeing and owning a few OXO products in the kitchen, I have high expectations from the company.For the price, sure it's easy to discount the flaws.I like the see-thru functionality so I don't have to guess if it's empty and what else may be in there.The problem is that the lid is easy to flip open.You can't just expect to dump this in your bag/baby bag without fear that the contents will scatter inside sooner or later.Then there is the see thru plastic that dents easily.The cup pressed against something inside the bag and there is a permanent dent on it effectively making it look even cheaper.It doesn't help that the feel of the plastic part is also cheap to touch.It's not like the OXO products I know.I hope this is not indicative of where OXO is headed.I don't use it to hold the snacks.I just dump objects in there like a pacifier for my baby.I really can't recommend this product unless they make improvements.Just plain not very good, for two basic reasons:1) It's too small.5oz may seem like a lot, but once you get your hands on this snack cup, you'll reevaluate.)2) There's nothing to prevent little ones from just dumping the contents.If it were a little bigger, i guess it could be used to store snacks that you might give your child one-at-a-time, but it's too small for grown-up hands to reach into easily.And as much as they want to toot their own horn about the non-stick grips, for little toddler hands, handles would be much better.This cup is too big around for little fingers.I'll stick with theMunchkin Snack Catchers, as they're bigger and keep more snacks off the floor (and have handles).I use this for my daughter's little hair stuff.It snaps tightly and even though it has fallen a few times, it does not come undone easily.I would recommend this over some of the cheaper stuff I have seen, and this is not all that expensive.Don't look at this as another way to control your child, but as a way for your child to become more independent from your constantly doing things for him!This product prevents accidental spills.Toddlers who intentionally drop it or spill it, probably are not given enough control over their world and therefore need to find ways to experiment.We have others at home are so poorly made that even I have trouble getting his food on the fork!They're also a great gender neutral color so that if our next one is a girl I can use them again.MATERIALS:  Packaging says BPA Free, PVC Free, Phthalate Free.We've been using them for several weeks now with runs in the dish washer daily and they still look brand new.They're so well made that I think they'd last no matter how many kids we have!Wife was doubtful but woke me early one morning to tell me how great this new brush was for our AVENT isis duo pump parts and bottles.Brush reaches in well to the pump components and fits just right for the bottles.The stand also makes it easy to keep dry and clean.Pros:- PRICE- soft bristles that clean well- stand w drain is handy- vents for nipple cleaner- no metal parts to rust (this was my problem w my last cleaner)Cons:- bristle head a little too soft (bristles are bent out of shape &lt; 1 month of use; maybe i press too hard?The bristles are soft and do not spray too much when you pull it out of the bottle.The brush holds soap well and cleans bottles quickly without falling apart like the munchkin foam topped brushes.The base is able to be drained so that stagnant water isn't sitting in the stand.The nipple "brush" is just a rubber poker type contraption.It doesn't clean nipples at all and is difficult to use.The nipple brush doesn't lock in very well so when you are cleaning bottles the handle keeps unscrewing which can be obnoxious.My bottles are clean like they are new!This OXO one is hands down, the better of the two.The other one has a foam end that is falling apart after only 2 months of use.You can immediately tell the difference in quality.The reason is because as I take it out of the bottle the bristles fling water everywhere including me!The avent one, I put it in a vase next to the sink and because it was sitting in a vase, I felt the tip was dirty (which was the nipple cleaner) and hence, didn't use the nipple cleaner.This one has a cute little stand with a rubber lining so it doesn't move much and it's easy to clean.I kinda wish the nipple cleaner could be removed by snapping it out verses a screw.On the plus side, the bristles are super soft and can reach into the bottle nipple so you don't even have to detach the nipple cleaning part on the handle.I got this brush when my munchkin bottle brush wore out.Also, the oxo brush comes with a convenient brush stand that doesnt tip over, much less annoying than the muchkin's suction cup end which was difficult to pry off wet counters.The only thing i do not like about the oxo brush is the nipple brush that attaches on the bottom since i find it cleans only slightly better than using your finger also the handle can often unscrew at the a joint where the nipple brush is hidden while using the big brush.Gets its job done, but I hate the nipple cleaner.I do have a problem when I twist the handle to clean as the nipple brush starts to unscrew.Maybe I'm using too much strength.My one major disappointment is the nipple brush.My silicone nipples need bristles to clean the fatty milk film.The problem is that I can't seem to find any way to buy a good nipple brush without having to buy another bottle brush!First a first version, it's not bad, but I do hope they make some changes with the nipple brush in the next version.Of those three the First Years cleaned the bottles better, but the foam would disintegrate after awhile and the steel wire in the handle would visibly start rusting.SO, I was excited when the OXO Tot line rolled out, and have not been disappointed.All the others weren't usable after a month or so.:DWhat I like:- Bristles hold soap very well, are durable but don't scratch bottles- Cleans greasy residue from breastmilk very well- Handle is durable (one of the other brushes I tried broke!Then I soap up the nipple cleaner well and insert it in the nipple, and pinch the nipple around the cleaner while twirling the cleaner a couple of times.That seems to clean them satisfactorily.It fits perfectly in the car seat and stays in place!I was afraid it would move around, bend, etc but I have had no problems with it.I wish I had found this product sooner!I've tried two brands of these piddle pad and this one is much better as it stays put and doesn't move too much with a squirmy toddler.I just spent close to $300 on a Britax car seat (with a not so easily removable cover), so I decided to order this piddle pad to make clean-up easier.It is perfectly shaped and cut to fit most any car seat or stroller.I feel much better knowing if my son has a blowout in his diaper (or an "accident" while toilet training in the future), that the expensive car seat won't need heavy-duty cleaning.PHEW!Purchased this one week and by the next week was sure glad we did...explosion contained!The only improvement that could possibly be made is for it to go further up the back for "those" moments.Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad, BlackAfter washing infant carries, carseat pads, and bouncy chair covers countless times, we stumbled upon these and were amazed.They make quick work of cleaning up leak-throughs.All I have to do is throw it in the wash, and it saves me the trouble of stripping down the entire seat, washing the cloth, and trying to put it back together again.We own 3, because each baby has one in their carseat, and our infant has one for whatever seat she is sitting in at home.I have never had any breathability issues, and the material itself is very soft and light.This pad is very durable and thick.I will attempt to wash again and hopefully the smell will fade since this will be great for protecting our Britax Roundabout 50.Good product but would be better if it had slits for the car seat straps to run through for more security.It catches a lot of mess when it's in place, but otherwise the seat covers still gets dirty.The price was unbeatable, and when it comes to changing diapers outside of home, functionality is everything!This changing pad is quite cushiony, so I can use this on a hard or uneven surface.I bought this in hopes to throw this in my purse so I could run to the store and not worry about lugging my diaper bag with.It however is bigger than I expected it and there is no way it would fit in my purse.If I could fit it in my purse, it probably would take up most of the purse.Good quality product, just not what I wanted it for.It is very hard to find gates this big.That way he has LOTS of space that I can use as the baby area.This way I don't have to baby proof the rest of my house (yet).The setup is very easy, and took about an hour to mount two to the wall and connect it in the middle together.My son hangs all over it, and we have no problems because it is very sturdy.It is easily changed from wall mount to freestanding as well.It folds to flat for easy storage or traveling.the outer rim of the plate is removable for cleaning but, stays put while your child is eating.the fork and spoon are curved for gripping and also have non-skid material on the bottoms.we have had them for a week so far and they are holding up well.good purchase.I looked at lots of different baby food trays before settling on this one.I liked the fact that it has a lid (most don't offer lids).Making baby food isn't hard but still takes time, and the tray makes it even easier.They are BPA free and relatively easy to clean.I got two and couldn't be happier.Best of all, these are decently priced!It's very space-efficient in the freezer too.I have to admit that I was a bit scared that it may not work as well as it's supposed to, so I only got one to test with.But it really does--so I'm going to be buying more soon!I am very happy with this produce.Never went wrong using OXO.Holds everything in place.I ordered this because none of the other bottle racks seemed to sit low-profile on a counter, or they were just too weird looking.This rack holds my Born Free wide neck bottles as easily as the smaller breast storage bottles, plus breast shields, falanges, nipples, collar rings, lids and whatever else you want to put there.Since it is about the same length as a normal sheet of paper, it allows more room for various items than other competitors.Are you tired of washing baby bottles and cups by hand?Oxo has solved this problem with its Oxo Tot Dishwasher Basket.It offers a dishwasher sanctuary for these small items and eliminates the need for hand washing.Oxo Tot Dishwasher Basket is actually a simple idea that should have been created a long time ago.You then fold the sides shut and place the basket on your dishwasher rack.These items come out of the basket clean and ready to use, eliminating the annoying task of washing by hand.Oxo created this item specifically for the problems associated with cleaning baby and toddler feeding devices and utensils in the dishwasher.However, it can be used for other things as well.I find it very handy for adult utensils.When this happens, I reach for my Oxo Tot Dishwasher Basket.I now have an additional utensil basket and my problem is solved.Washing small kiddie dishes by hand isn't necessarily difficult, but it can be time consuming.It's a handy product and one I'm happy I got the chance to try.They do not " escape" and end up at bottom of dishwasher in this.Since having a child a few months ago, we have had many little parts to run through the  dishwasher.We were using a plastic tray that you could set things on, but it didn't fit in the racks well, and stuff would often fall off of it.Enter the Oxo Tot dishwasher rack.It's a plastic (feels software, somewhat 'bendable') rack that fits perfectly in our (and I think it would in most) dishwasher.It has a nicely designed opening mechanism, a set of doors that also double as a place to put pacifiers/bottle nipples/etc.Inside there are clips on each side to allow hooking straws, etc in.It's a very simple product, but you can tell a lot of research went into.It's miles beyond what we were doing before, and it makes washing pacifiers/bottles very simple.It appears as the Oxo Tot line is emerging again, previously just had a few products, but now they are launching with a full line of great products.I was worried that they wouldn't be as great as the Oxo kitchen products we already love, but if this one is any indication, they definitely will be.OXO's Tot Dishwasher Basket is designed for washing baby bottles and other small accessories in the dishwasher.To solve this problem, OXO basically gives us a plastic basket with securely closable lids and a lot of reasonably large but still small enough holes.The idea is very well conceived and makes you wonder if really no one has thought of it before.However, I must note that there is no reason to limit its use to baby items only.Try measuring spoons and silicon rubber spatulas (especially those that comes apart into a silicon tip and a plastic handle).I laid the lids flat on the inside of the box (3 fit), and then in the top fold-down lid of the basket, I placed the sippy cup stoppers.The first thing I learned very quickly was that the basket MUST be placed on the top rack of the dishwasher.On the bottom, the lids would often be turned upside down or the stoppers (oblong in shape) pushed out of the ends of the basket because of the force of the water.And I think the design could have been made less open-ended so there wasn't concern about stoppers coming out.[Update April 2013: this has never been a problem actually in 2.5 years of use on the top rack]But despite this limitation, I found the basket very useful.But, the holes in the basket allow adequate water flow to get through, while also containing things nicely.It seems very durable, contains pieces, and allows you to get them thoroughly cleaned.[Update: Still very happy with this 2.5 years later.]This basket is a little bit longer than the munchkin basket that seems to be the "go to" tot dishwasher basket.It holds the straws upright and on the sides to allow the water to run through them and get them really clean.There is no danger of them making an escape in the bottom of the dishwasher as they are securely held in place.The white portion of the basket below is great for larger plastic parts to sippy cups, silverware, lids etc.I have used it on the top and bottom racks with no meting or warping.The plastic is durable and should hold up for as long as I need the basket.HOWEVER, I find that nipples are often too wide to allow the opposing side to come down first.The inside space has holes to line up the straws.It will be lot easier to use it once you see a few pics on the amazon customer images and their video on using it properly.And yes it is free of toxic materials in plastic and hence is very baby-friendly.I almost literally smacked my forehead when I saw the cleverly-designed nipple holders on the top of the basket.Why hadn't someone told us about this two years ago?Hard plastic straws?Holders along the sides.If you're concerned about exposing your baby to detergent and dishwasher has a "sanitize" setting, you can toss your gear in the basket, run the cycle without detergent, and be reasonably sure that you're not going to wind up with a plastic mess from parts bouncing around your dishwasher, or coming too close to the heating element.The basket openings are small enough to keep any common baby item safe, but large enough to let everything get clean.And like many other OXO products, the overall construction quality is great.Not to mention the basket is BPA-free.I consider this type of basket a must-have for parents of babies and toddlers unless they want to do a lot of hand-washing.Not just bottle parts but also pacis, utensils, sippy cup parts, pump parts and even small toys make it worthwhile.Most are supposed to be in the top rack of the dishwasher only, and this is the best way to keep all those little things up there.The OXO basket seems to be well-designed and well-made.That said, which basket works best for you is largely a matter of your dishwasher and exactly what you are washing.The fact that the nipple compartment built into the lid opens down the middle does help stabilize the basket and make loading easier - but makes it hard to open if you load it with little utensils that get turned sideways.The straw holders (slots for 8) are inside the basket but fold well out of the way when they aren't in use.I find this to be roughly equivalent to theMunchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket Colors May Vary, which I also own.The OXO version is more expensive, but also about 1/3 longer, so probably worth it if you need that space.Munchkin's lid compartment has the same issue with being too small for bottle nipples that are on the large side.In the end I might favor the OXO basket slightly, but find them very comparable in value.The OXO Tot Dishwasher basket is great for keeping control of your infant and toddler bottle and cup accessories, including baby nipples, Sippy Cup straws and such that would otherwise get caught in the bottom of your dishwasher.The product works as described and you'll save money by extending the life of bottles, nipples, etc.Can't recommend it enough.I used to use one of those dishwasher baskets for all the valves and parts to my son's sippy cups......but I've replaced the clunky basket with this.The smaller size does make it easier to slip into the top rack that is almost always full at our house!So other drain thingees (don't know what they're called) you get at loews or home depot and have to install it by screwing it on, or something more complicated!This one is so rediculously easy, clever and you can CLEAN IT too!I can see it possibly not working for certain odd-shaped bathtubs with drains that aren't flat but for the typical generic tub, it's really quite convenient.Clever too.Even has a little suction cup on the little tail end to hang on your bathroom wall when you're done plugging the drain.Who would have thought-it's so simple- just cover the drain verses that whole metal screw thingee that we all grew up with!Cute, cute, cute!I let my little boy run around the house it these and they absorbent, but don't feel "dry" to him like a disposable will, which helps him know when it's time to go to the "potty".I much prefer him in cloth diapers when I can find one that actually fits him, but it's tough to find any diaper (cloth or disposable) to fit him.The side snaps on this diaper make it much easier to adjust for a baby like mine who has always grown faster, and has a larger bottom and thigh area compared to other babies his age, but still has a regular sized waist/hip area.They are my favorite diapers, along with Little Lions, and so absorbent!I have the unbleached cotton and the bamboo and both are so soft and fit very nicely, and work well with my Bummis covers.I can't wait to buy more!We bought them to replace two Britax Marathons that kept our kids safe when a hit and run driver almost totalled our minivan...  Was scary, but the kids barely noticed the accident in the Marathons even though my wife felt pretty bumped and bruised.I'm hoping it will last.I have read it is the highest on the market- Adjustable harness height without major rethreading/adjustments (though you must unbuckle the seats to do it)- Ability to use it as a high back booster after your child outgrows the harness- Long life span- the seats have a 9 year life span (barring damage)- Installation with LATCH - I found the belt tightening/latching sequenences really easy with this seat - as easy as my Marathon and much easier than with the Graco Nautilus and Sunshine Kids Radian 85.They have "short path" and "long path", but many vehicle seatbelts are not long enough for the long path install, and the short path install does not seem as secure.- armrests are in the way - the armrests do not fold up/move out of the way, so when installing you are forced to lean on them getting in and out of the car.I've been very impressed with this seat.We wanted to keep him harnessed longer since he didn't have the maturity to sit still and upright in a booster 100% of the time (most kids don't until around age 6).He actually prefers the 5 point harness in this seat over his booster seat that is in our second vehicle.I would like to preface this review with the idea that I didn't buy this because it's the `most expensive' seat.All car seats in the US must meet the same safety standards.Pros:- Highest 5 point harness height on the market (19.5" top harness height): Due to my son having such a tall torso, this was one of the only car seats that we could keep him harnessed the longest in.- 9 year life span- Ability to use it as a high back booster after the harness is outgrownCons:- Installation: Since I've never owned a Britax before I was unfamiliar with the long belt path installation.Due to my sons weight being over the 40 pound maximum that our Kia Rondo allows for LATCH, it had to be installed with the seatbelt.The seat was very loose with the short belt path, so I was able to just barely install it with the long belt path.Needless to say, I had a certified CPST double check my install (even though I am one myself).- Mesh seat material snags easily- Possibility of armrests breaking when too much weight is put on them: This hasn't happened to me, but I've heard it from others.Britax will replace these for free if this occurs though.Overall, I really like that this seat will keep my son in a 5 point harness as long as it's needed.I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a high weight harness car seat that has the budget for it.I'm so glad that Britax has a combination option since I don't think he is ready to be in a regular booster seat yet.We enjoyed the Britax Roundabout for its safety ratings and secure installation, and I was hoping for the same reassurance with the Frontier.It took me 70 minutes of trial and error to install this seat the first time I tried it.We always used the seatbelt with the Roundabout, so it was my intention to do the same with the Frontier.However, after trying both the "long" and "short" seat belt routes, and enlisting my husband's help, I was incredibly frustrated.I highly recommend a LATCH installation with this (at least for Honda Odysseys like mine!I've been buying Britax for almost 14 years (probably have had as many of their products) but will stop when they outsource to China!I must admit at first I balked at the price tag of this seat.Boy was I wrong.I refused to even consider using the seat belt while he's so young.I did extensive research and kept coming back to this seat.When Amazon had the sale that gave $55 off the price tag I knew it was time to bite the bullet.I am ecstatic!The seat is a bit heavy but not cumbersome.The width is just fine for the car and I had no trouble adjusting the fit or placing it in my vehicle.My son loves his seat and when he fell asleep there was no head/neck bobbing.If you have a tall child or are looking to keep your child harnessed as long as possible, you absolutely MUST buy this seat.We have done alot of research into getting a child seat for both of our cars.Our first was a Safety First Alpha Omega and it worked pretty well for us.Then time to get a second one and with him been bigger now, we thought to give the all-time favorite Britax a shot and we sure am glad we did!Prices on Amazon.com is also hard to beat elsewhere.I was all set to buy the Graco Nautilus carseat, but was still wondering if Britax Frontier 85 might be better.Both carseats were not being sold in any stores for me to go and check them out, so I decided to order both and test them out.I am SO glad I did, because in comparison, the Britax was BY FAR the better seat!And believe me, I REALLY wanted to love the Graco seat.I would recommend to anyone to pay $100 more for the Britax Frontier 85, cause you get so much more in the long run!Here's why:1.On the Britax Frontier 85, the furthest crotch slot is 8.5 inches!With the Britax, he has plenty of room to grow and most likely will not be sitting on the crotch strap!2.That totally made me question how it would affect his developing posture.3.The material on the Graco Nautilus is awful!The seat is rigid and feels like sand paper/cardboard!4.The harness strap on the Graco Nautilus is kinda short when pulled to the limit and doesn't look like there's much room to grow in it.Pretty disappointing when they claim a child can be harnessed up to 65 lbs!I am 5'1 and 105 lbs, and I was able to sit comfortably in the Britax and strap myself in harnessed no problem!That is phenomenal!!!That's how I know I made the right decision.My son hasn't been in the Britax for a drive yet (cause he's still too little), but I imagine it will be very comfortable (to the point of sleeping in it).And when he sits in it in the house, he doesn't squirm or scream (like he did in the Graco Nautilus).I returned the Graco Nautilus ASAP!UPDATE: I did not realize that this seat specifies the child must be at least 2 years old.So with MUCH regret, I have to send it back.I am now a total Britax fan!They truly make the best car seats I've ever seen.They are very expensive IMO, but so worth the money!All I know is that every car seat I buy from now on is going to be a Britax!We've had this seat for about a week.It's a very nice car seat.So, we decided to buy new seats for my oldest daughter.I was originally planning on buying a $50-ish booster, but looked at them in the store and they felt so flimsy.It arrived quickly (less than 24 hours after I ordered it - and I had chosen the 2-day shipping) and installed easily using the short path and tether in a 2000 Camry.The buckle system is a little more difficult to clip for my daughter (she had been buckling and unbuckling herself in her Generations for a while) and she still needs some assistance getting it buckled.The only thing I was disappointed with was when it arrived, it (the Pink Sky version) had a Made in Thailand sticker on the box (covering the previous made in USA info).It appears they have very recently moved their manufacturing oversees - so recently in fact, that the sticker on the seat itself still says it's made in North Carolina.Always a disappointment when manufacturers move their shipping operations abroad.This car seat has it all.The safety & consumer ratings for Britax finally convinced me to go for it.I did it in under 10 minutes, by myself, 8 months pregnant.I cant say enough good things about it!Overall, this is a great car seat.I bought it because the buckle strap placement is adjustable and it has solved our problem (the strap on the buckle of our old car seat was too short and made the seat uncomfortable for my son).I definitely would recommend this seat.I got this lunch box for my 9 month old son's bottle, breakfast and snack for daycare.It is a bit small, but that's what I wanted and it is really cute.He loves playing with it even, especially the banana zipper.I wanted to order this lunch bag with the dog backpackSkip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dogfrom Amazon.But when I went to a local retailer, I saw this lunch bag and it was so cute I could wait to order it, so I bought it at the store.The dog is definitely the cutest then the bumble bee.My son is only 10 months old so I just used the lunch bag to keep his bottles cold with a ice pack.It is very nicely made, and durable.This lunch bag is great for children 9 months to 3 years old.It is great that the lunch bag can clip onto the backpack.Great product.I bought this to match the skip hop owl bookbag.It is very very cute.It is a decent size for a lunch or meal but not too much more.I used an ice pak in it to keep her yogurt and juice cold.Saw it on Amazon had to buy it - I was not disappointed when it arrived and after using it, I'm even more impressed.It's great quality - durable with a good zipper.I use this to hold baby food and drinks for my toddler and baby.I hook it to my stroller and use it for snacks, milk, and sippy cups.This way my diaper bag is kept clean.I cant tell you how much $$ we saved by getting these!I have a habit of forgetting my son's sippy cups in the car and in my diaper bag so they end up needing a little more than a quick wash.I used to throw them out and buy new ones but I got tired of spending the $$.I kinda felt guilty too.It seemed a little wasteful.They cleaned my sippy straws and lids our really well.I actually got one of the extra spout brushes to clean my crane cool mist humidifier (such a paun to clean... that should be my next review ;).The price for a two pack can't be beat.They are pretty large, and they cover almost the entire window.It came folded about 6" x 6" separated by tissue papers to prevent them from sticking to each other.They are big once unfolded.It is a static cling, but they softer and more pliable which has a tendency to produce some air  bubbles.The best thing that works for me is to lay them slowly and carefully, and then flatten it with a microfiber cloth or soft tissue paper.Just be mindful that this product will not work on power windows.The sunshade will get caught and prevent the windows from going down.Great for stationary windows at the back of SUV's or vans.I have flannel and bamboo but when I have a messy job I reach for these to get the job done.Each side has a purpose for me, the terry cloth side to rub the bottom if anything is stuck and the softer side for just a wet diaper or if there's a rash.Super handy to have and so thankful I got them as a gift.I'd recommend having around 18 wipes on hand, I say that because when I was trying to decide how many I should have, I would read the reviews and not too many people suggest how many to buy.It's not too big but big enough for me to use if need be.We really got it for my daughter who is 2 1/2 to use.She uses one in the bathroom to use the toilet by herself.She also uses it as a seat from time to time.The color is a muted green so not too obnoxious but doesn't get obviously dirty the way other colors do.I like the neutral color for this stool, the little grippy feet so the stool doesn't slip on the floor, and the weight is perfect for a toddler to carry around a room with ease.Not only is it eco-friendly, but it is the tallest kids step stool I've found.We have another step stool, but it's too short to help my son reach the big potty, or even the sink to wash his hands.This is just the right height for both.It is slightly taller than the Baby Bjorn (I set them side by side in the store to test), and measures 7.5" tall.I will say that I have not tried my baby in this yet.We have an original Bjorn which she likes because it does not spread her legs as much as other carriers.I thought this would be good because of the better back support but it feels somewhat bulky when I put it on.Also the front panel which folds down to allow the smaller bottom section does not fold away and secure well.I am assuming it folds under the belt but it would be nicer if it detached completely.Worst of all the instruction manual is not very good at explaining how to transition the carrier from one position to the next and where to tuck everything.I am considering sending it back.I must admit this one is my favorite.What do I like about this one?The materials are organic and the carrier is well made.So many carriers with thinner straps seem to cut into your back, shoulders or arms at some point.One of the best things about it, is the baby's weight rests on your hips rather than higher up.I've had carriers where reassembling them after a walk to the park where my child was taken out and put back in was a frustrating experience getting the straps right again in order to put the thing on.This one is much easier than several I've experienced, but they have a handy "cheat sheet" sewn inside the carrier!The Company does not recommend this for babies under 13 pounds, so I was a bit disappointed that my coming grandson won't be ready for it for most likely a couple of months.However, my toddler granddaughter had a great time being Nana's lab rat!In the last carrier we had, the leg openings were very tight no matter what we did to alleviate pressure on her legs--we had to abandon that one after her legs started turning bluish color.I also own the Original Baby Bjorn, which is great, so I was very excited to give the Comfort Carrier a try.The material is nice and doesn't smell chemical-y, even right out of the box.(I never worry about my baby being unsafe when he is strapped into a Baby Bjorn carrier.)I found the Comfort Carrier to be even easier to set-up, lock into place, and adjust than the Original.It did take me a second to remember that the bottom, padded strap sits right above your hips, not by your waist.With the Original, I noticed that I started getting a sore back and sore shoulders when my son reached about 14 lbs.(I am 5'6" and pretty fit for having given birth a few months ago, so I don't think the soreness happened because I am completely out of shape--or at least that's what I tell myself.)The extra padding on the shoulder straps helps, too.The big question is, is the Comfort Carrier worth the price?I had been lent the original Baby Bjorn and my son was good with it--not great, but better than other carriers I had tried (slings).He was getting bigger and I needed something to help my back.This product is great!I barely notice his weight.It really does distribute the weight onto the hips.I would highly reccommend this if you are looking for a carrier for the long term.The BabyBjorn Comfort Carrier is the Cadillac of infant carriers.Speaking of larger child - this carrier is designed to carrier infants/toddlers from 13 to 31 lbs (in contrast to the original which holds infants 8 to 25  lbs.)This feature was the main selling point for me.One quick safety tip - don't attempt to use as a back carrier.This carrier is designed for front carrying only, which is great for bonding and talking to your baby.And, if you're a busy working Mom like me, making every moment count is of the utmost importance.I've summarized a few pros and cons below.Pros:Comfy!Comfy!First off, let me say I don't have a baby to put in this yet, as I am still pregnant.Before, you had to buy a size specific carrier.I am about a size 22-24 pregnant right now, and it fit me with quite a bit of room to spare.My first thought at seeing this was "it looks COMPLICATED."I couldn't have been more wrong!It is easy to put on, just slip it over your head and buckle the waist buckle in the back.If you have to make the waist really small, there are loops on the sides to hold the excess belt material.The buckle is interesting, it isn't a traditional squeeze buckle, it is a tension type buckle and it makes it easier to undo behind your back.There is a cross brace slider thing on your back that can be adjusted for support.That was the only thing difficult to reach after having the carrier on.It would be easier to adjust before putting it on.The "snaps" up top to let the front be released to put the baby in are a cinch!The old carrier had actual snaps that were a total pain to use.This one has snaps that also seem to work on tension.There are two small leg straps to use for smaller babies, and they hang free when not in use.The front also has a zipper that can be zipped up to make the carrier smaller for smaller babies, and unzipped when you need the carrier to have more room.It also comes with this odd looking bib thing to put over the front to protect the carrier from drool, etc.It wasn't the easiest thing to put on the carrier, and it looked like it would hang free and be wonky, but it might be different once a baby is in the carrier.The only thing that will take some breaking in is folding over the front of the carrier for the baby to look out.Because this item is so padded everywhere, it is harder to fold over, but in time I am sure it will get easier.One other great thing about this carrier is that the directions on how to use it are stitched in fabric right inside the carrier in the front where you can easily reference it.Very convenient.I never used the old carrier, I really hated it and found it hard to use and adjust.I feel totally different about this carrier.He did use the old carrier, though, but felt this one, while bulkier, is far superior in comfort, convenience and support.Yes, it costs more than many other carriers, but you get what you pay for!We got this bjorn after already using the ergo and the original bjorn.We originally purchased the ergo.First thing that I noticed was that the directions tell you you can only use it facing forward up to 26lb.This was a big disapointment and I highly considered returning it and getting the less expensive bjorn with extra back support that goes up to 26lb.The second disapointment was how you put the baby in.I really liked how easy it was to put the baby into the original bjorn, this one is a little more complicated than the original bjorn in that you have to lift him up and stick his legs into the pouch (for lack of a better word).It is easier to use than the ergo.It is difficult to tell how the product works when you look at the pictures on-line.I was tempted to send it back after looking at the directions, but we decided to give it a try.It puts a lot less strain on my back that the ergo did (when the baby was on the front in the ergo it would hurt my lower back/hip and the bjorn does not).It is a little more difficult to get the baby in and out, but not terrible.We really like the head support that this bjorn has when the baby is facing inward.The Ergo is nice, but if he falls asleep (which happens a lot in the carrier facing forward) there is no head support option.Having both this and the ergo give us the best of both worlds because if we want to stick him on our backs we use the ergo and on the front we use the bjorn.If I had to pick one of the two I might lean toward this one just because our little guy really likes to face out and the headrest is great oh and it is a bit easier to put the baby in and out than the ergo.Just remember with this one you can't use it till they weigh 13lb.With the ergo you can use an insert and use it earlier.I got my original one on craigs list for $10.If you think you might want this one then getting a used original to start you out is probably a good idea.I was happy to find a mat that didn't have a juvenile pattern.Seems like good quality that will last a long time.My only complaint is that the rise adjustment snaps won't stay snapped very well.The waist snaps work great, and they appear to be the same, so maybe this is a fluke with mine.In a few months this won't be a problem when it doesn't need to be snapped down, but for now its a pain.I'd buy more, but I'd expect the issue and just live with it.I bought these cloth diaper covers to go with my Clotheez prefolds.I wanted the obvious benefits (environment, save money, potty train faster...) of cloth diapering but I was a bit apprehensive at first.I did alot of research on diaper covers before buying these covers.They fit my three criteria of having Snap covers, leg gussets (must have), and being adjustable.After having these for almost 3 months they have saved our furniture and our clothing from a lot of possible stains.I have also tried disposables that could not beat out these covers blow out protection.The blue color cover that I purchased on my own has 0 stains on it.I love these covers so much however that I'm buying the 2nd size so that I can be ready when my son is big enough to wear them!Suggestion : BUY COLORS!Part of the fun is that you can dress your baby in something different.i bought these ones because my child knows how to undo the velcro ones and she hasn't figured out snaps yet.the down side is i have a small baby and the snaps dont have a right setting for small children they fit okay they just get a little loose around the waist once you get the diaper in there.but the quality is fantastic just like the other ones they dont leak and survive most anything.i went for the snap version as opposed to the velcro to try something different with my cloth diapering adventure.the rise snaps come undone when on the middle setting (no, they aren't too tight when there, the snaps just seem loose).it feels very secure on the leg gussets and waist.i tend to just keep it open on the largest setting to avoid the annoyance of hearing the snap pop open when my daughter crawls around.I've been CD-ing for three years, and I wish I'd started using these wrap snap covers earlier!I started out with pocket diapers because I thought they would be easier, but I have now changed my mind.I use tri-fold inserts with these.I'm also thrilled to have completely velcro-free multi-size covers, and these fit both my 10mo and my tall 2yo beautifully.Thirsties Duo Wrap with snaps are awesome.I have never had a leak because they have cool leg gussets that hold in the mess.These covers are definitely my favorite out of Kushies, Mommy's Touch, and Thirsties with velcro.Pretty bulky for a newborn, mine was 8.5 pounds when we brought him home.I can't ever see using these on a 6 pound baby because he is now almost 12 lbs and using the smallest setting.They do leak if you don't change the flat fold after one wetting.My baby is a heavy wetter and so he leaks through almost every diaper in less than 3 hrs.I would not use over night ever.This is by far the best cover we use, fits great and never any leaks!I purchased the Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap for my 22lb child and they fit great on the smaller setting.This is my favorite cover for my toddler.I have Imse Vimse, Little Beetle, Bumkins, and Kissaluv Wool covers along with the Thirsties.I haven't had any leaks or blow outs in these either, even with the explosive BM's that newborns have in the first few months.The leg gussets are also a plus in preventing leaks.My daughter is now 15lbs and is in the 50th percentile for weight and height, and she has just outgrown these.But I must say that that isn't bad considering all of these sizes are approximate and most of the other covers I've been using hasn't been even close to their size ranges.She could still wear them just fine, but I've moved up in size in her prefold due to blowouts for every BM she had, and the cover doesn't fit with it.Still a great cover.But to use a cover, literally from birth to 6 months, is not bad for the price.I have had very few leaks using this diaper cover, the only problems I've had have been my fault.However, I believe the sizing is off on these covers.My daughter is about 13.5 pounds and they almost don't fit!I know all babies are built differently but I was hoping these covers would fit longer.It has worked with only a little dampness by morning (and my son is a heavy wetter!).Oh and I like the orange-very cute.I actually couldnt get my child to sleep with this.She didnt want much to do with it.I kept it by her bed but I didnt notice that she was sleeping better.It is just ok, it smells good and looks nice but that sums up what it doesIt's a cute and soft "pillow".It looks more like a flat stuffed sheep.I put it on the crib and he won't have anything to do with it, he's 18 mons so maybe when he gets older he will?not sure, if he doesn't then this must be the most expensive stuffed animal he'll have.Update: My toddler is 21 months old now and loves his pillow.He uses it now every night to sleep, so finally not a total waste of money :)My children were fascinated as I explained the toy actually mimics how live whales eat.I have also used it to dry bathing suits and wash clothes after use.We already had a bath pail when we got this one.However it was so big and bulky we only used it once.to top it off the only option it gave us for mounting was the permanent sticky tape.That said, there are several things I love about this bath pail.1) I love that it comes with a suction cup wall holder.This allows us to use it in our temporary residence and take it with us when we leave.2) I love the way it comes off of and hooks back onto the wall holder.There is not a lot of fussing around trying to find the sweet spot to hook it onto, and I can hook it on with one hand without looking.It also has little feet on the wall hook to give it leverage if you pull it off the stand a little hard.3) I love the shower it provides when you scoop water into it.I have a different brand of bath toy holder that is also supposed to provide a similar shower effect, but the holes are too big, so the water just pours out instead of trickling out.This is essential for anyone bathing a young baby.My daughter can sit up mostly by herself, and she loves to sit and splash in the bath with her toys, but I need to keep one hand at least available for any tips or slips.Using this pail, I can dump out her toys, shower her with water to keep her warm, scoop up her toys and mount it back on the wall hook, all with one hand.Two things I want to say.Until recently, I had no idea OXO entered the toddler/children market.It is a wonderful design on someone else's concept, kind of the old saying - a better mousetrap.My wife loves it because it's easy to mount to tiles.Our toddler loves to play with it.But he just started to be bothered by water poured out on his head.The bottom of this device lets water out similar to a shower head, although obviously with no water pressure.My child loves this product, and the size of it is perfect for all the various bath toys.The tiles are new as no one has ever showered on those tiles so they are clean.Even adding water to the suction cups does not help the product stick to the tiles longer.The product comes w/ sticky tapes as well, but since my child sometimes bathes in different bathrooms in our house I prefer the suction cups instead so that I can move the product from bathroom to bathroom when needed for a less permanent residence.Overall, it's a great product but I had problems w/ the suction cups.The 'OXO Tot Whale Pail' in blue is a very handy bathtub toy.It's quite large and should hold your child's most favorite bath toys easily!For my testing purposes, we used the suction cups.In fact, the holder hasn't fallen off the wall yet and that is after multiple baths and showers.I've been thinking of getting a similar item from another manufacturer for a while; what delayed me in buying it were the reviews that said it comes detached from the wall unless you use sticky adhesive tape.The Whale Pail comes with about 9 suction cups on the back so it suctions onto the wall GREAT without regard to your tile spacing.It scoops up all the bath toys in one pass, the water drains out of the holes, and it mounts easy to the base (which is suctioned to the wall).Great product.The drainage and airflow holes are great for keeping things from getting musty.The whale stayed suctioned for 5 days before the first 'fall-down'.I've made a point of giving it a little push-back each time we hang it up after scooping up the toys.It's been fine since.While I do think the ledge legs are a nifty idea, they don't work with my tub so I can't say how well they might be.Overall, I'm pleased with this product and would recommend it to my friends for their little ones.UPDATE 9/16/2010: After Trying to use this unit for more than a month and a half, I am ENDLESSLY frustrated with the suction.Absolutely nothing I do helps make it stick for longer than a couple of days to any of the surfaces in my bathroom.Even when we don't remove the pail so as to limit jiggling it on the holder, the darn thing keeps falling down.Now it sits sadly on the bathtub floor.Revised star total to 2 for my experience.Perhaps I simply have the wrong surfaces in my bathroom.I was excited to try this out because I've had my eye on similar products for some time and our current bath toy storage was making the bathroom look cluttered.If you don't want to mount it in the shower or on the wall, you have the option to use the included stand for placement on a counter or perhaps the corner of your bathtub.I tried the stand for a minute, and the whole thing immediately fell over when full of lightweight Thomas squirt toys.Several times a day I walk into the bathroom and hang it back up.Every morning my husband moves it onto the sink because it has fallen off while he was in the shower.The suction cup panel has stayed put all but once, so that's not the issue.The issue is that the whale just fits the panel so poorly that any nudge or even a breeze from the bathroom window seems to knock it down.It's frustrating because it really would have solved the storage issue we were having if only it stayed put.My gripes with this thing don't end there.If you have seen or own the Thomas & Friends squirt toys, they're not big.And they're not heavy.Yet, one of them barely fits the width of the mouth on this thing.Not only that, but the holes in the sides designed to drain water, don't.The water pools in the tail of the whale when its hung up.What's the point of that?I may yet try another version of this product that I've seen sold locally (and is also cheaper) but I recommend staying far away from this product.I am a previous owner of the Boon Frog Bath toy organizer and i had mixed feelings toward it.It holds all my kids toys which is about 10 different things.So i feel that it holds an adequate amount of toys.The whale pail also suctions VERY well to our tile walls that have pretty bad hard water stains.This was a very big problem with the Boon Frog that i had before.it fell pretty often and collected mildew behind it.So far the whale pail has done neither.I was a little worried when I first ordered this because I was thinking I would have to find a place to store it.What I did not realize was that it comes with this great mounting kit so you can mount it right on the bathtub wall.It's out of the way but still within reach of the little ones.Now we don't have all the toys hanging off the edges of the tub ready to fall in when we are showering or cleaning.The holder itself also becomes a fun toy at bath time because the kids can imagine a big whale is gobbling up their boats or other toys.In fact this is one new favorite bath time toys in our house.Overall everyone is very happy with this product!This thing is so cute.It is bigger and sturdier than it looks.You can scoop up with the handle and you can use it to rinse.it sticks to the wall and so far so good.Overall it's a cute pail, that the kids enjoy to use and have fun with - which is the important part.The build quality is very good.The one issue with it, is that it doesn't stick/hold in the shower.Product description quote:"Holder securely suctions to the wall and sits on the bathtub ledge for more security"This just didn't work as advertised, and hence the star off.They have their own favorites when it comes to tub toys (and they bring a lot of toys).The whale is not  only a receptacle for the toys, it is also a toy in itself.Sometimes they play with it as a basket hoop using the other toys as balls.And sometimes as a sea monster gobbling up all the debris she can find on surface.After bath time, clean up time is much easier as it takes only a few seconds to scoop all the toys.The whales has holes drains out the waters.Very convenient.Included are  2 wall attachments, a suction cup or a more permanent adhesives.You can move the whale anywhere if the kids change their minds.Some cons to consider:- if your kids play with a lot of toys that submerge to the bottom, they would need to help pick them up with their hands to shovel them in the mouth of the whale.Otherwise, floaties are much easier to scoop up with this gaping whale.Thank you, OXO, for helping make bath time a fun experience for mommy and daughter!The whale is big enough to store all the alphabet letters and a few miniature Barbies that used to reside in a pail by the tub.I love the holes that allow ventilation and that keep the toys dry.I like the overall fun shape, the color that suits our ocean theme perfectly, the sturdy design that has been proven again and again with each and every drop, how easy it is to store, to clean, to mount, that ALL of the kids bath toys store so neatly on the back wall of our shower and the overall fact that with all of the drainage holes, I know that the toys won't get moldy since this is so effecient at drying even the smallest bath squirt.To be honest I am not sure what the kids like better; to be able to play with this in the tub with their toys or use it as a fun whale that swallows all the toys when it's time to clean up!The whale is very generous in size, making the dimensions around a foot high and 10 inches wide.There are two options for hanging; suction and adhesive.I choose the suction option and while the whale has been repeately bumped off the mount, the suction hasn't fallen off our walls yet and it's been over 3 months, which is a much better than the green frog competetor, which I was forced to return after a few weeks due to it's lack of suction stamina.I have had some troubles getting this review to post, so forgive me if I am brief.This is a cute product that makes a handy addition to your child's bathroom.Many of the storage containers store things across the tub - this puts the toys up on the wall.It also allows you to scoop up the toys using the whale's mouth - a fun way to clean up - and then let them drain and store on a wall.The wall attachment can either be suction-cups or adhesive.I have been volunteering at a summer camp for disabled children.One of the main features of the camp experience is a gigantic water table filled with small toys such as boats, toy fish and little action heroes.Clean-up time has become a snap ever since I brought the OXO Whale Pail into the mix.Before, it was always a bit of a chore to get the kids to scoop out the wet toys and place them in the big buckets next to the water table.It's a win-win situation all the way around.5 Stars!It comes with two mounting bases - one with foam tape and the other with suction cups.We used it a couple of times in the bath and it very helpful at making clean up a game that I thought "hey, I'll bet this will work with the Lego's"It's even better for that.They basically use it as a dust bin and sweep the toys into the whale with their free hand.We don't have a huge amount of bath toys, so I'm thinking this is going to be a "land whale" for now.If you have any questions or comments, or found this review helpful, please let me know!Like other reviewers have noted, the canopies are quite flimsy.Since we're still using infant seats, only one canopy fails to provide adequate coverage, and there are products out there to extend canopies that work with this stroller.The break is sturdy, the adjustable and padded handlebar is great for the tall and short (my husband is 6'4" and has no problems using it), and the underbasket storage is decent.Though it's a little bulky and heavy (especially after delivering twins, it's hard to lift this stroller in and out of the car!), it's quite durable, handles fairly well, and has held up well during off-road and bumpy walks.They're too long, too wide, too hard to steer, etc.I have the cubes pattern, and I really like it.The adjustable handle is great.We can both push the stroller without kicking the wheels.The weight recommendation is 40 lbs per seat, and a 40 lb child would easily fit in the seats.I like a smaller seating area for the kids.In some of the other strollers, my kids seemed to slop around in the huge seats.The front seat has the option of two cupholders or a bar.I opted to put the bar on, and was pleased to see that the bar is covered in fabric, rather than foamy material.The baby can chew on the bar (and she does!)The stroller is easy to fold and unfold, and I really like that when you fold the stroller, it stays folded.The stroller is not as long as lot of the doubles, which I love.I hate to feel like I'm pushing a train, and this stroller is definitely not a train.I believe it is 47 inches from the bar on the front to the handle.I recommend it to anyone and everyone!I orginally purchased a snap n go double, but found that the carseats don't really "snap" into it, and the whole thing felt too rickety for my comfort.They really do snap right into place, and are as easy to put in and out of the stroller as they are to place in the car.Other big pros are: standing fold, large, easily accessible basket, cup holder for mom, and a quick fold and unfold handle.The only big con is how difficult it was to put together in the first place- make sure you read the directions!Anyway, I think it will also be great when the kids are older to sit in.I was very excited when I heard Chicco was finally coming out with a double stroller.I was initially against any double stroller; I just didn't want to mess with it.We already had a Chicco car seat and Trevi, so we knew we liked Chicco.And I wanted both kids to be able to sit comfortably.After hauling this thing all over Europe, here is why I love this stroller:You can easily snap the Chicco car seat into it.When we want more control of our toddler, we place her in the back and baby in the front.But when we are just enjoying a walk she loves sitting in the front to see better, and hop in and out on her own.I was able to easily carry diaper bags, luggage, groceries, etc in that thing.I also like that the basket stretches in front of the rear seat.They aren't large, but the fact that they adjust so easily means you can keep your children covered from rain, or keep the sun out of their eyes, no matter what angle.I also love having the two cup holders for mom and dad, as well as the two cup holders on the front seat.But, if you have them turned out, you can't fold the canopy up when the stroller is folded, and if you have them turned in, you can't fold the front seat down to accommodate the car seat.The handle bar adjusts easily for pushers of different heights.Sometimes we found the stroller can be a little tricky to fold up - the lock only requires one hand, but you have to maneuver the stroller just right to get it to collapse on itself.When folded up, though, it's not too huge - it easily fits in our Honda CVR, no problem.Like others have said, it is heavy, but it is a double stroller, that's what you get.It is lighter than many options, though.My close friend has a Graco double, and she is super jealous of our Chicco!One other negative is there's no handle or really great place to grab the stroller to carry it when it's folded up.Coming from one mommy who didn't especially want a double, is only five feet tall (and not very strong!), but realized she needed it, I would never use another double stroller.I find this product useful especially since I use cloth wipes.We spray his butt then wipe and he smells great.The previous reviewer complained about the smell but I didn't find the spray to have a strong scent.I feel much safer using a glass bottle over plastic anyday.My baby appears to like these bottles over the smaller plastic bottles I was using before.Be sure to get extra nipples, especially for level 1, since in time the hole may open wider to release too much milk.And lets face it, if your baby has found a screw driver, batteries are your last concern.She stops crying when we turn it on clipped on the car seat.We use it in the stroller all the time too.She plays with it & I don't have to worry about her getting hurt.When they get older we can use it ourselves!The only cons I have are that the batteries run out really quickly, I don't like how you have to unscrew the back to change the batteries & sometimes when you position it certain ways, the adjusting arm gets caught & the fan won't run.When I bought this mattress I was looking for an organic mattress that wasn't covered in plastic and didn't cost a fortune.Over all I'm happy with this mattress.The price was good (I found it at another retailer for less).It comes with a waterproof mattress cover, but I don't use it and instead got an organic wool crib pad (I don't like sleeping on plastic so I don't think my baby should have to either).It fits my Graco crib just fine.The only down side is that I will say that my baby's head formed a small indent in the mattress very quickly and you can somewhat feel the springs.The product that I received is white, not light brown colored as shown on the picture.It arrived without any damage, sealed in a plastic bag.Upon opening the bag, we noticed a marked odor (not a chemical smell, more like a musty/stuffy odor).It seems to have disappeared completely though after airing the mattress outside for a day and inside the house for another day.Baby seems to like sleeping on it.Overall, I am satisfied with the product; I just wish I had shopped around more for the best pricing.These are well made and they are so soft.You probably can't see in the pictures but they have a really cute border/outline of baby material.However, they are way too small for my liking, so I returned them.I don't know the exact dimensions but they are just barely large enough to drape over your shoulder.These are standard burp towels.We use these burp cloths all the time!Recommend!However, the decorative edging on the product is unraveling which is annoying.I'm looking for more burp cloths now and will try another brand.This may be TMI for some people but I've been primarily using these wipes in order to clean off my baby boy's genitalia, since doctors recommend avoiding the use of baby wipes on that area if the boy has been circumcised.At first glance, these things looked really cheap in the store, but I bought a pack anyway.They may be thin, but the edges of the cloths are VERY soft.They also don't have any annoying labels on them, so you don't have to worry about that when wiping your baby's face.For the price, if you happen to lose them, they don't hurt the wallet as much.I'm definitely buying some more.We use these as cloth wipes, as they are very soft, absorbent, and durable.I got these washcloths because they were the cheapest ones I could find.Can't beat that!I've bought several more packs of these and threw out all of the othersThis one is larger and can hold more milk which is nice.I use it for storing only (sometimes, feeding) and my baby can grow with this size.I recommend this seller.The side closure is easy to get undone after my son is feeding without having to reach behind his neck with one hand.They are easily some of the cutest bibs I have found and the price simply can NOT be beat!!I was given 3 sets of these and use them the most.My baby seems to get rashes on his neck because of bibs, but they are essentially since he is prone to spit-up.We were using pre-folds on our newborn with diaper covers, and after several issues decided to try something else.One of the big problems with pre-folds in the middle of the night is the time it takes to change.Unless we're really quick, the baby started to wake up, and when she did, she wanted to stay up.Changing with these All In Ones allowed us to get up, change her, and she was back in bed before she realized it.They are very soft (bamboo lined), absorb a lot of liquid, and keep the baby much happier than the pre-fold/wrap combo seemed to.The snaps are nice and solid, and stay snapped (unlike the covers we were using) which means everything stays inside the diaper where it's supposed to.They're also very minimal on the waste packaging / products / chemicals if that's important to you.We're currently using these on a 16-17 lb baby (started using them at 11-12 lbs), and they snug up quite nicely.It's not exactly the instructions they suggest, but we haven't had any problems with break down or bleach, and they're still very absorbent.One thing we've noticed though, is because she's starting to hold her bladder more, she'll sometimes save up so much overnight that when she does go it will leak.The extra bulk doesn't seem to bother her any.I have had the gDiaper, the BumGenius diapers, disposables of various countries, & in the end.. this is our FAVORITE diaper!The BumGenius ones are too tight in the leg or too loose in the waist (forming a gap between tummy & diaper).The are very roomy!Very absorbant!And the nice bamboo silky side ... well... poo just slides off when rinsing!I hate poo & my gag reflex is easily set off... these are great!You can rinse & toss in the wash as is & the liner will work itself out & get clean & dry!The velcro tabs are my favorite!There is no easily way to just pull them off (which many kids will do).This is truly an all in one that is worth every penny spent!I have tried several different cloth diapers - Fuzzibunz, BumGenius, Swaddlebess, groVia, Thirsties, and many more - these are my absolute favorite HANDS DOWN.They do not stain, they are incredibly absorbent and very very soft.Also, the velcro is super high quality and sticks!The fit is phenomenal.I recommend these.We have them in every color and I use them almost exclusively.He learned to put in his pacifier by himself.Now that he's older, he holds it by the giraffe and pops it in his mouth.What's nice is that when he's finally weaned from the pacifier, he can still play with the giraffe.He can recognize it from across the room and run towards it.I got the giraffe just before my daughter was born, so I had it with me to take to the hospital.It is very lightweight, yet it will stay in place on baby's chest so that the Soothie doesn't fall out and roll away.My daughter is only 6 weeks old but we have used this every day and we love it.It's very easy to clean and is machine washable.The pacifier does not detach from the animal for cleaning, but the animal dries quickly.I wash ours by hand, squeeze all the water out and it will dry in about an hour (it's barely damp after sopping the water out with a paper towel).We just ordered another one (the Lion) and can't wait to get it!It is very cute but I don't like the fact you can't separate the pacifier from the animal.When she spits up, it of course gets on the animal.Someone said they put the wannanub in the washer.That to me is gross.My daughter has 5 wubbies and they are the best!I am ordering the giraffe soon!The animals are really soft and floppy great for babies.Has become my grandson's favorite wubbanub.(I am updating my initial review that said we could live without this product...we CANNOT live without!)PROS:-Cute-Easy to find the pacifier with such a big thing attached to it-Good pattern for the baby to look at-Will hold it propped in her mouth if she's REALLY REALLY tired-Easy to grab, so at night she can find it in her crib and pop it back in her mouth!CONS:--> Only reason I'm giving this 4 stars: Paci doesn't detach so the animal AND the pacifier have to go into the washer-Easy for baby to grab and she pulls it out of her mouth ALL THE TIMEI would buy this again and am tempted to buy a second one just in case we lose this one!Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has.We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his "wubbas" (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.The wubbanubs are very easy to clean and they have been very durable.This pump is the only one I have ever used.I use the Simple Wishes Hands Free BustierSimple Wishes Hands-Free Breast Pump Braand have no problems.Mine even came with an extra parts set.The main issue I had with this is that it is loud!Two others have said they could talk on the phone with it, but not mine.I pump at work (we have a designated lactation room with curtains).I never realized exactly how loud the Ameda was until someone in the next stall over started pumping as well and between the two of our Ameda pumps we made quite a racket.It seems especially loud next to the Medela Symphony (hospital grade)Medela Symphony Breast Pumpwhich is also available for use at my work.So basically, if you are using this pump at work I'd say its not super discreet (in sound).For me I am usually mashing in everything if I include the 6 carrying bottles that come with.I also keep my wallet, phone, and a mini umbrella in there.Finally, as all the other reviewers have said, you may need additional carrying bottles.The bottles that come with hold just about 5 ounces, and that means six are filled up pretty quick in a day.I use the Lansinoh breastmilk bags, and although they are kind of messy, they are sure easy to transport.I really like the cooler it comes with too.A lot of people rave about the P******** wet bags, but I prefer these hands down.I'm selling my other so I can buy another of the Bummis.There are a couple of reasons I like it:1) The price is very reasonable2) Washes very well and dries fantastic3) The handle is very convenient to attach to the stroller or diaper bag when we're out and about.The bag is really cute and great for travel.I cloth diaper my son and used this bag when I was out and about.Unfortunately the bag tore in the wash the second time I washed it and it was never put in the dryer.Once you touch the bag you can tell its not very durable.I gave it two stars because it's a cute bag.Guess I'll have to figure out how to fix it.Definitely not worth the money in my opinion.I wanted something to put my dirty cloth diapers in when I'm "out and about" instead of plastic bags.This was recommended to me by a friend who used it during the two years or so that her daughter was in cloth diapers.So far, it hasn't failed me.It's also cool looking so I don't have to make space for it inside the diaper bag...I can just clip it to the strap and let it hang outside the bag without people necessarily knowing what's inside.It's big enough to hold 3 or 4 soiled diapers, though I'm never away from home long enough to have to put more than two diapers in it.When it's empty, it folds up small enough to fit in the smallest zipper pocket in my diaper bag (and I have a pretty small diaper bag,) so it doesn't take up valuable space.No regrets and I'd recommend to a friend.I really like this bag for my cloth wipes.It doesn't leak and there is no odor.I've been using it for maybe a year now and it looks brand new.My only complaint is that I wish it had two loops on either side so I hang it better.I absolutely love Ju Ju Be products!They have thought of everything!The fo leather is great looking and doesn't look cheap, plus it wipes clean and is machine washable!It has tons of card slots and room for everything in the wallet.I'm very pleased with the quality of this wallet.See Ju Ju Be's website for videos and descriptions of the inside of the wallet!At first I had trouble deciding between the Be rich and the Be major, but definitely made the right choice in going with the Be rich wallet!These wash clothes are just what I wanted.After reading lots of reviews I knew I wanted to purchase a pillowcase for my Snoogle that had the zipper.This pillowcase is pretty easy to put on, it fits a little snug but it is doable.The fabric is pretty soft even though it is thin.My main issue is that I started breaking out with cystic acne on my neck (both sides) and I think it was from the pillow &/or pillowcase.I do have to say the price for this pillow case is insanely high (around $25) for a piece of fabric with a zipper.I bought only one & then had my mom make me a few more pillowcases & my neck acne has cleared up since I started using the cases she made me.This item was very poorly made.I was afraid that it wouldn't even stand up to a wash, or putting it on the pillow.The zipper was very cheap, the fabric was thin and scratchy.It did not match the description online (or the packaging that it came in.)I immediately returned it.Now, I just wrap my pillow in a jersey sheet and it is much preferable.The fabric is soft and t-shirt like.I didn't feel like it was so big that my husband was being pushed off the bed, which was good!Edit 2/24/11: I've been using this for months now and I am 36 weeks.I haven't had any sleeping issues with my pregnancy and it keeps me very comfortable.The cover washes and dries well, no shrinking or pilling.It hugs my body and supports my hips, back, and stomach.I bought this Snoogle with the 100% cotton jersey cover after returning the Original Snoogle to Babies r Us(which in my opinon came with scratchier cover).Here's the thing- If you get the original Snoogle and then later buy the 100% cotton cover seperately, that cover is $30ish on top of the price of the Snoogle.It's cheaper to buy them together like this set.Though I do wish the overall cost of the product wasn't so much, it is helping me sleep at night.Also, would like if there was a wider pillow portion so minus a star.I still would recommend this to other women who are pregnant and wanting help with sleeping on their side.These sippies can be a pain in the butt.If you don't get the nipple on just right, they leak pretty badly.You have to make sure the nipple is completely flush with the underside of the lid.I really wanted a large, good quality mirror for the crib.I also like that it can sit lower down in the crib and fits just perfectly over my breathable bumpers.The only thing I would say is that it's not too interesting on the outside and my baby doesn't seem interested in it so far.In fact, he hates them.He only likes the MAM pacifiers.Right now my son seems vaguely confused and annoyed by these, so obviously they require different skills than his old cups.He still asks for them because he likes the robot, but the milk doesn't get guzzled with the usual speed.On #1-- wrong-O!And milk gets stuck in all the many little crevices of the spout unless you soak or very throughly rinse the silicone piece before it goes in the DW.Oh, and Nuby's helpful teeny-printed insert says "do not put in the dishwasher."I agree with the other reviewer that these do not leak at all.The baby seemed to like this pacifier but after we used it for about a week his latch started getting lazy and I experienced pain while nursing.After we threw this pacifier out he started nursing properly again.They are easy to squeeze to get the icee up, but it is too hard for her to pull the plastic through the bottom.It's nice that her hands don't get really cold though.Overall I would say these are good to have around.I have a very small one year old (still wears 3-6 month clothing) and she barely stays on the mat while playing.It also isn't as slip-resistant as others, as she has fallen over when soaping her a few times.It does stick very well to the tub though.this bath mat is super cute, but I can't really get it to stay in the bath.Maybe I havent really worked on getting the suction thingys to stick, but anyways it stays, but doesnt stick.It's not like my daughter sits on the mat anyways, she is too busy standing.The backpack straps are built-in and when you want to stow the straps away, you just unclip the bottom clips, place the backpack straps in the zippered compartment in the back, and zip up.Under the messenger flap is a deep zippered pocket.But  a few things bother me.I hope timi and leslie can improve on.1)The inside lining is dark chocolate.Very very hard to see, especially it is a deep bag.It seems I have to "scoop" the bottom of the main compartment to make sure things did not get forgotten.The lining in the main compartment is not sewn down.You can flip it out and get rid of crumbs, etc..  which is good, but on the flip side, it often creates crevices and hard to see the bottom of the bag.2)In the backpack mode, the hard board at the bottom of the bag pokes at my back.The company should get rid of the cardboard and instead, reinforce the bottom with leather to give it structure.3)back of the bag is not padded for comfort.These are deal-breakers for me.Not a big deal... but for a mom on the go, it could be annoying.Also, pay attention to the picture of the internal main compartment.I've been using this bag for 4 weeks, and so far I really like it.without a problem.Have gotten a lot of comments, since it's not a copycat of all the other bags, and it matches my Mia Moda Atmosferra stroller perfectly.I have been using the Uppa bassinet for my 8week old baby.I ordered the snug seat so we can start going running.FYI before the snug-seat my baby would slip through the side when using the stroller seat.The snug seat is soft and thick to give support in the stroller.If the clear plastic bottles are what you're looking for, this is probably a really good deal.I personally have an easier time measuring with the bottles that have printed markings on the outside, but Medela is Medela.Also, they refunded my shipping due to the "pictured" vs. "received" product discrepancy.They have no markings printed on them (as the bottles in the picture do), instead the measurements are raised in the plastic itself, and the plastic felt different.Possibly an old version of the bottles that have been available in stores this year?They accepted my return, no questions asked, but I lost the shipping money, both ways.Very disappointing.Not to mention the cup holders are very convienent, and sleeping in it in the car isn't too bad for the tilting head.The seat covers are also easily removed to wash as well.The only problem I had w/ this booster chair was that I had a little difficulty installing this product to fit next to 2 infant carrier chairs in both my Toyota Avalon and Toyota Tacoma.By itself and if you don't have other infant or children chairs next to it, then the product fits great.I would definitely purchase this product again when my twins are of the correct age.I opened the box in excitement after i discovered that it was among one of the top tested seats.seat is ready to go right out of the box, just remove the plastic wrap.its incredibly light for its size and feels durable.measurements taken in planning and developement were dead on.Update 10-2-10: I use this in my older Audi, which doesn't have latch attachments in the seat.It constantly falls over when I go around a corner.There is no 5-point harness.It does have a pathway for the belt to follow, which makes it easier for my kids to put the seatbelt on.It has removable cup holders, unfortunately, they do not lock in fully, and by that I mean if you turn it half way it stays in, but keep turning and it will unlock.This is helpful if an adult will be sitting next to the seat (though it will still be a bit cramped).We have one for each child.For us, the 5-point harness is key, and while the Britax is more than twice the price, I wouldn't trade it for long distance/highway driving.Back to the Pathway.....I use it in my car for when I have to take one of my kids around locally, and it works well.One annoyance, and it goes for any belt booster is when one of my children fall asleep in the car, the belt does not give them the same support that the 5 point harness gives.I try to use this (and our other boosters) strictly for local driving and when I do not think they will fall asleep.Also, it is heavy.This is not a bad thing, because it is a solid booster.....it just makes it harder to carry around.Again, the weight is the only issue, as you will have to lug it around the airport if you do not check it.Over all, this fits between a regular sit-on type booster seat that has no back, and the full blown, 5-point harness seat.I am happy with this, and if I didn't know about the Britax, I would be thrilled with the Pathway.....I am still happy with it, and believe it does serve a purpose, but I will continue to use it as I have mentioned.I should note that last year I tried a different 5-point harness (I do not remember the brand) and returned it because it was junk, and the only one that met our expectations/standards was the Frontier.Please note this does not take away from the Pathway, I am merely trying to show you my point of reference.The arm rests move up so he can easily put his own seatbelt on which has been a major problem with other seats due to his short height.I was really impressed on how nicely and compactly this folds up - almost flush.However, the best part for me other than the high saftey reviews was that there will be no more messy sticky cupholders since these include REMOVABLE yellow cups that can go straight into the dishwaher!The seat also provides a removable and machine washable pad that easily comes off, comfortable support for the head, back as well as bottoms, and a style that my husband doesn't complain about when he needs to take him in his antique chevy truck.I rated it 5 stars because of the convience of being able to clean it, its comfort, safety standards and something that never happened before - a child that cannot wait to sit and bukle himself up for car rides.This is called a "booster seat" but really it is so much more.When I think of a booster seat, I think of a little boxy thing like we see in the restaurants, but this is a "big kid" car seat.The bottom portion is softly padded and just enough lift that a child as young as 4 (and meets the three requirements for use of the seat) can see out the window of the car.It has arm rests and two *yes TWO* cup holders or goodie holders that come out for washing!Yea!The fabric is durable and appears to have some water proofing treatment as witnssed by my spilling something accidentally on it.The beading was instant and gave me a chance to wipe up the spill.I especially like the shoulder/side and side head impact padding.In case of an accident, this booster car seat will have better protection for a child than for the adult driver.The way this product is made the car seat belts come through the guides so that the belt is in the proper position on the child and does not cut into his or her neck, which causes the child to wiggle out of the restraint seeking a more comfortable poistion.With this booster seat, the belt is in the proper location across the chest and lap and keeps the child in the correct sitting position.This is just an excellent product, and I am so glad to have it!This seat has us just as pleased.It came assembled and was ready to go straight from the box.It is lightweight and easy to put in the car.The padding is comfortable and it fits really well around my child's head.It has two arm rests and two cup holders.The best part about the cup holders is that they are removable to easily wash off any sticky juice or other spills.The fabric is liquid repellant, so that too is easy to keep clean and it goes in the washer on the gentle cycle quite well.It also folds easily for storage.It's designed for my child to use for a long time, so I'm sure we will enjoy it for years to come.Initially, my husband and I liked the convenience of rotating the car seat and docking it onto the stroller.However, we soon noticed a major problem.If your child is facing you (toward the handles), there is too much weight on the side of the handles.Therefore, if you put even a super light diaper bag or a shopping bag on the handles (or if you're strolling uphill even without a diaper bag), the stroller will fall toward you.When my baby was 3 months old, I stopped on the street to tie my shoelace and the stroller came crashing forward.Fortunately, my baby was strapped in so he wasn't hurt but the fall did startle him... and my soda on the handle bar spilled all over me.There are other problems with the Orbit system, but I think this design defect is a major problem that should be addressed.Recently, we had the same issue with the toddler stroller seat (my baby is now 16 months old and weighs about 27 pounds).I had my baby facing me and only had a sandwich bad on the handle bar that weighed at most 3 pounds.My baby was sleeping when I decided to check my mail.When my baby woke up, he sat up and leaned forward, which caused the stroller to fall forward again.My baby was strapped in so he wasn't badly hurt other than the scrapes on his hands.However, this problem is a dangerous problem that Orbit should address immediately since another child may not be as lucky.The problem with the toddler stroller seat is that, in addition to the stroller being unbalanced as it is, the toddler seat flaps forward when a child sits up.Therefore, the weight of the child leaning forward will cause the stroller to fall forward.I brought this problem to the attention of Orbit.They claimed it's not a design defect and just offered a small discount on the G2 version.I find their response totally inadequate.I really never thought I would nurse in public, but I didn't really think about all the not so public places that you will want to nurse (your home when you have guests, in the car b/4 you go in or in public b/c of poor planning).I liked these mittens very much.They are soft and well done.The only problem is that the ad says '12 months' and they definitely aren't for 12 month's babies, not even 6 months...We have a small house and I have been able to take the monitor all over and down into the basement without losing the signal.But now, at 7 weeks age, this is one of her favorite toys.She can stare at it for 15-20 minutes, occasionally cooing and smiling to it.So I just stick it in her bassinet between the mattress and the bassinet's side and have safe 15 minutes to go about my own business.After all he will only be 3 months old.We love the baby einstein toys they are always good quality toys.We recommend this product to others.It is alot cheaper on Amazon than it is in the store too!It really gets his attention every time I shake it in front of him.I would definitely buy this again.This is my baby's favorite teether even though he has a little difficulty managing it.This teether is very cute and well worth the price.The jelly part can be refrigerated, which your baby may enjoy.This is one of my favorite teethers for my baby.Baby Einstein toys in general have been a hit in my house; This is no exception.Enjoy!I had given up on the idea of cloth diapering my newborn, but immediately got sick of all of the disposables I was wasting money on.These diapers never seemed to get damp from the inserts/prefolds, they didn't stain, the insides aren't the plasticy-type material you get with most diaper covers, and my baby never had a blowout out the tops.However, I really wish they had leg gussets...as leaking occasionally occurred (but not often).I suppose leaking could have been averted if I used prefolds with a snappy...but I folded them into simple "inserts" instead...and they weren't secured tightly around the baby's legs.I will definitely be using these for the next baby!Update 10/31/2013:Baby #2 is here and I can't in good conscience leave my original 3 star review!I don't understand why these things have to be so expensive, but there didn't seem to be any better priced options that were this warm.I bought the 6-18 month size for my 10th percentile 13 month old thinking it should fit him through the winter no problem.The Baby Deedee sleep sack is close fitting and does not really allow him to walk.The first morning in it, I found him standing awkwardkly in his crib with his feet far from the side, leaning over to hang on the side.I think he was stuck!We probably need to modify our bedtime routine to put the sleep sack on just before saying goodnight (instead of at the same time as pj's, then picking out books to read, etc.It either plays piano lullabies or nature sounds.You can play these by themselves for about 20 minutes or with the slide show for about 10 minutes.I have the same batteries in it that I put in it when I bought it and I've used it multiple time through the night every night for the last 2 months.The slide show is a bit lacking... it is the same two slides over and over, but at this age I don't think they notice(at least my boy doesn't seem to care).You can detach projector to take anywhere and there is a mirror behind it for playtime in the crib.Pros:- Lots of music/sound options- You can use the projector or just sound- Easy on batteries- Nightlight- Portable- Crib mirrorCons:- Same 2 slides over and overThis has helped my baby fall asleep, and stay asleep if he starts fussing a bit in the middle of the night for 2 months.He enjoys it and so do I. I would recommend this soother!I looked at a lot of double strollers when I was pregnant with our second child.I landed on the Joovy Caboose Ultralight and am so glad that I did.My girls are 23 months apart.My older daughter didn't ride much in the stroller even before we had the second so I was immediately attracted to the sit and stand models because it fit her independent personality because it allows her to get on and off my herself and decided whether she wants to sit or stand.I was attracted to the joovy sit and stand because it is so compact.Some of the double strollers I have seen are so big that I cannot image pushing them through a lot of stores.And I liked that the ultralight has the Cool Essentials Parents Organizer included (a $25 value) - the organizer is one of the coolest and most useful thing!The only problem we have had with the stroller is that it barely fits in the truck of of our Civic especially when you have the infant car seat adapter on it.So if you are looking at this stroller you might want to check the dimensions to make sure it will fit in your trunk.My baby loves the walker and I am very glad I bought it.The toys on it are very entertaining and made very good.It took him a day or so to get the idea and start moving his feet, but now he is zipping around our house.I like that the toys can swing out, which leaves you with a fairly good sized tray for snacks.The toys are ok.For example, the walker won't go over our flooring thresholds because they are too high.However, I would note that we only have hard surface flooring in our home, and we don't have any stairs.*Update 12/14/10* My son is 11 months now, and he still enjoys his walker.However, there is no seatbelt in the walker, and he has figured out that if he grabs onto things, then he can pull himself up to stand in (or on) the walker.This has become a big safety issue, so I wanted to note the lack of a seatbelt for other parents with climbers (or future climbers).Just want all to know it's made well and if you are buying this as a gift, you get my thumbs up.These are so cute.I love that 2 out of 3 have a cute saying "I love Daddy" and "Daddy loves me."This is a good burb cloth.I didn't realize babies burb up so much milk but this did the job of protecting my clothes.These are larger than the current burp clothes I use but they're very thin and don't hold up to much use before needing a good washing.I bought Gerber terry burpclothes that are much thicker and better than these but unfortunately, Amazon sells those for three times the amount of these burp clothes...I think I much prefer the gerber cotton burp cloths that resemble cloth diapers.I will update this review if my opinion changes after I actually use these.I bought this rattle for two main reasons:  Lamaze products are very good quality as a general rule, and I love pandas so I couldn't pass this one up!The rattle is cute and well-made.The fabric is soft and holds up well with washings.It's small enough to fit in a baby's hand, and will be great for when my DD starts teething.I gave it only four stars because the rattle is barely audible; while I don't want an obnoxious sound, I like it to be loud enough to get my DD's attention!The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the handle in front is a white felt/wool-like fabric that gets dirty very easily.I think the handle should either be a different color or a different fabric.Leaks!and easy to see your wearing them if your not wearing very loose fitting tops warning don't wear grey with this or any color that darkens when wet!go with Lansinoh disposable nursing pads they are thin and don't leakThese bottles worked fine for us at home.The one problem we had with them is if the caps are over-tightened, it does not vent.The vent holes are on the nipple where it comes in contact with the ring.Too much pressure and the hole gets sealed allowing no air in.(Sealing also happens when the nipple area with the vent and/or ring that it makes contact it are wet).If the assembled bottle with milk in it gets heated after you tighten the cap (not too tightly), when it is warmed up, the cap ends up being way too tight.Something expands I guess.So you simply loosen and retighten.You may need to do this again halfway through if you see that baby doesn't seem to be making progress.However, if you use a daycare, since it gets tighter after warming in hot water, and they've already tightened it, you will be lucky if they know to loosen and retighten it.And you may mention it to the caregivers several times, and if you're lucky, they will remember and do it.We haven't been lucky.However  baby #2 does spit up quite a bit.I do love how they hold 5 ozs allowing you to mix formula in it.UPDATE 2010/12/2I purchased the Avent Phillips bottle.My baby immediately went back to taking a full bottle at daycare (It varied from full to 2ozs to 1.5ozs with the Gerber bottles, depending it seemed on which caregiver.)As far as spitting up - she used to spit up after breastfeeding but not at daycare.(Probably overfeeding at home, but not able to get enough at daycare with the old bottles.)Now she spits up both at home and daycare.Looked back at my journal notes - she was gaining 1oz/day in weight prior to daycare.This went down to less than 1/3 oz per day after starting daycare -less than the low end of the average range.(Same thing with baby #1 except I thought it was due to constantly being sick.)Now her weight gain is back up.I did alot of research before buying this seat.. supposedly its one of the safest in the world.. due to germany's car seat law- its rated to 45mg in crash test's where usa is only to about 30 mostly..I love this seat for the seafety reason's & i would have kept it, but it was just too tall for my car.i have a chevy malibu maxx & there is alot of rear seat room as the back seats are adjustible.when i adjusted it for her in the living room she just sat there smiling & kickin her feet around, she sat in it on the floor for a good 30 min!the material is great- not cheap at all, lots of padding.so i donl't see how a newborn could fit in it.. but the instructions were great & went into the car very easy.There were things I liked about both and disliked about both.This is how I feel about the recaro after owning it for a while...I love that this seat sits up high.My son almost instantly stopped crying in his car seat now that he can see out.They are closer to the side of my sons head which prevents the side to side whip lash of the neck that can cause injuries.I also like the amount of cushion in the side impact, enough to stop the momentum, not too soft or too hard.It was also extremely easy to fit in the car.And it is very easy to adjust the harness and head rest without taking anything apart.My biggest complaint is that the cover is not machine washable.It cleans up well with a washrag so far and it is removable.I haven't tried hand washing the whole thing yet.Additionally, I couldn't have used this when he was an infant.I don't love that it stays reversed only to 35lbs or 37.5 in.But something that a sales person told me might come in handy for you, children tend to outgrow the height requirement in a carseat long before they outgrow the weight.You can often save yourself some money by getting a seat that doesn't go as far in weight but goes to the same height.(Unless your child is heavy or stocky).My child is very tall for his age but not very heavy.All in all, I love this seat, as does my son, and would buy it again over the Britax.Addendum: At 9 months he is still using this chair at the absolute lowest setting.The low weight classification for staying reversed bothers me less and less.Although not recommended on my models, I have run the covers on the gentle cycle in the washing machine and dried flat without problem.To those who have asked about the headrests, what i liked is they go out at 90deg from the back of the seat and are very near my childs head.I had bought a bottle rack that was half the price of this one to begin with...and I was annoyed with it within the first week of having my baby!Great for BFing moms to put all their pump parts out to dry as well.I got this drying station because it was compact.I don't like the tines though.The positive is that you can put up however many tines that you want.The negative is that they're not strong enough to stay up.Not impressed and have since purchased the Especially for Baby Bottle Rack (smaller version and not found on Amazon, but can be purchased for $3.99 at Babies R Us).I bought this carrier in hopes it was a more affordable option instead of shelling out $100+ for an Ergo/Beco type baby carrier.Unfortunately, it is far inferior to those!Spend some more money and get a comfortable carrier!At first I thought the music was too loud, but then found the volume button and began to really like this toy.I would not name it a soother since it would only sooth with a low volume, and yet it can do that quite well -- there are just so many options and the use of motions, that it is not merely a soother.The toy installed easily and looks great on my daughter's crib.What I really liked about the toy was having all the options available.I really think the toy will keep an infant interested for many months, but I am not sure of how interesting it will be for toddlers.That is the only reason I did not give the rating as 5 stars.Third baby coming up in a few months, and since we gave away all our baby stuff after 2nd child was born (OOPS), thought I would order and try this "soother" since the Fisher Price Aquarium soother we had for previous kids was such a hit (but unfortunately started leaking after several years).Unfortunately, this model comes up short.It's "OK", but I personally would not pay more than $[...] for it.For one, the music quality is not good.I keep harping on this with various kid toy reviews, but there ARE manufacturers out there getting this right, so it's certainly possible.Will a baby know the difference or care?Probably not, but why introduce low fi (relatively) crappy sound quality as some of the first music that a kid hears?I have a list somewhere of similar kid or baby toys that have great sound quality, so as I said, no reason NOT to do this (especially at this price point - if this was selling for $[...], ok).I have no problem with the music itself, or the sound effects, both are OK.Volume control.It does have three settings, but what this kind of toy REALLY needs is an adjustable volume wheel.While three is better than two, inevitably, the options will not always fit into all situations, like a variable adjust wheel would.As mentioned by others, the (I assume) plastic gears make way too much noise, considering the small amount of movement the bugs make (in fact, I wasn't sure if one of the bugs was broken or not, it moved so little).I could continue to pick nits, but the bottom line is there are better crib soothers out there on the market, and no compelling reason to get this OK one versus those.MUCH more interesting than this one IMO).Attachment to crib was ok, but I do prefer the way FP soothers attach.Here's a link to the referenced FP one, but I think probably discontinued now (and looks like someone is taking advantage of that fact by overcharging big time!It truly entertains my 1 1/2 year old cousin, Nickie.From what I can tell, she most enjoys it when the music is off and the characters are jumping about/lighting up.Tunes include music and 'nature sounds'.The nature sounds are my favorite of the two choices.Overall, this Firefly Soother is a cute device that does its job well.Learning to separate from mom or dad can be tough, and having some cute bugs singing to you can make it easier.I love that you can get bug sounds or music, movement or no movement.I'm tempted to keep this in my room to drown out the older kids' noise when I want to take a nap.:)On the negative side, the bugs don't really move much or change much.It's not too loud for me, but baby might need to be placed on the opposite side of the crib if it bothers them.It's cute factor is also its strongest plus.I attached it to my daugther's crib and initially was impressed with the clasp and strap, thinking how much easier it was for me to attach then her FP brand soother... what I realized about a week later is that it's also not up to the kicks from my 5 month old daughter (so I can only imagine how it would work for a larger baby able to really grab at it) and it's come loose and I have to keep tightening the strap daily... due to it coming lose when she kicks it it has also now left very noticeable marks on our dark wood crib (very not happy mama about that) from where it hits back and forth if she kicks it.The bugs are very cute but the mechanics to make them move are pretty loud, I wouldn't say it's a deal breaker (and you'd be surprised what can get your baby to fall asleep, mine doesn't seem to mind the mechanical sounds at all... but I do).I also have issue with the volume, on low it's nice and soothing (we really only use the lullaby sounding setting) but if you turn it up the speaker/recording quality is really bad... as in I can't listen to this bad.So leave it on low!The lights are nice, I personally think it's enough light, I don't want my babies crib lite up like a Christmas tree at bedtime so I think the very soft dimming spots are nice and just enough to catch her attention.See that big green button, that's how you activate it... looks super easy for a baby to press right, and it is... you'd think this is a good thing?Nope!Every single night, for days and days my baby would kick it in her sleep (she's an active sleeper) and it would turn on, just loud enough to wake me up over the monitor...I'd go in and turn it off (she'd typically still be asleep) just to have it happen again a few mins later...The other soother she has in her crib has an equally easy to press button but its a bit smaller and doesn't stick out so far, so she hasn't managed to get that one on by mistake yet in her sleep.I'm thinking this will likely become a cute outside of the crib toy, maybe secured some how in her pack n play.Unfortunately, one of the bugs (the yellow one) is malfunctioning and barely moves its wings.The sounds on this loop, as most toys like this do, but the loop is very short and is easily discerned by an adult.It is a rather large toy and is about the size of a paint can.It can be strapped to a crib or used as a standalone sound machine.The Infantino Firefly Soother is a mutlipurpose electronic tableau that springs to life or lulls your baby to sleep (hopefully).There are basically three settings.One of the settings produces no sound and only very slight movements and occasional dull lights from the fireflies.The other two settings are more impressive: the fireflies, frog and caterpillar move about while lights turn on-and off.The soothing mode produces sounds of nature like crickets chirping, while the entertaining mode produces music.There is a control for low or high volume.I found the soother to work well for entertaining my baby, but she seems to fall asleep on her own best without distractions.in their children's crib or soothing to sleep...so I can see a good market for this toy.The nature sounds are quite soothing for my baby girl...and for me.One negative is the unit is pretty bulky, so it will take up some real estate in-crib.Also, I would have liked more songs for entertainment as it isn't worth getting just for use as a toy.Basically, it works really well for what it is designed for, but could be more versatile.Overall, the Infantino Firefly Soother is well-designed with no noisy gears or other issues.It's very easy to set up and use.It even comes with batteries already put in.The colors, sound and motion were all very attention-grabbing for my baby and she seemed to instantly like this toy.I'm not sure parents need a device like this to help their child fall asleep and it could be a potential distraction.I would recommend this for any parent interested in trying out a soothing electronic device (perhaps after tiring of cranking up those hand-wound mobiles for the fiftieth tie in a row).I want to start off this review by saying that I really wanted to like this product.It's cute and the overall concept of this crib toy is appealing.Unfortunately, beyond it's cute appearance, there isn't much about it that's noteworthy.Let's start with the ease of attaching the toy to the side of a crib.This is a snap and is probably the most impressive feature on the toy.Considering this is a toy I'd have to say that it's pretty sad that this is the best feature.The lights on this toy are incredibly dim.If you put this on in a dark room you'll only see very dim blobs of color that fade and slowly light back up to their very dim "bright" setting.I suppose if you want to bore your baby to sleep this product might work.The music is ok.Perhaps that will appeal to some people, but it didn't win me over in the least.When the toy is on the motion setting it is very loud.The minimal motion inside the bug jar isn't very interesting.There are other crib toys that get the job done better.Fisher price makes crib toys that actually light up (and have different light settings) and are soothing.The motion in their crib toys is nice and quieter.The bottom line is Infantino tried to make a cute and functional crib toy and they failed.They should stick making rattles, which they do quite well.I would not recommend this product.I don't know how necessary these types to crib toys are but they sure are cute.This one has several things I really like about it.Sort of white noise for babies.There are all sorts of combinations to make just about any baby happy.Night noise, night noise with fireflies lit up or add to that moving bugs and a frog to those.There are also two different songs to choose from.I can't tell you the number of times I ran the vacuum to get my kids to sleep!There is also a function that turns off all the noise and the baby is able to push the large green button and turn on and off different fireflies.The first one wasFisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother.The Firefly soother is a nice viewing size (10 " tall) and made to look like a jar full of bugs like fireflies, frogs, and a caterpillar; very cute!You can also adjust the volume.That being said, I'm very disappointed with this soother.Could the thing be any louder?!Maybe it's just new and the gears need to run awhile.Unfortunately, I don't recommend this soother because of the loud gears when set in motion... and seeing it in motion is what my son likes!This is unfortunate, because I really like it, and other than the motion setting being loud it's very calming; I almost want to set it up next to my bed!But for 5 dollars more, I'd go with the Waterfall Soother.There's a strap that is fastened around the crib and a safety string of sorts that can be used as a backup (I think.)It is important to note that the plastic buckle is very secure since it requires both hands to attach and remove.No infant/toddler would be able to release the buckle.The soother has three different settings - a light show, music and nature sounds and movement.The light show consists of the firefly's gently fading red, green, orange and red lights.There are two musical settings, one nature sound setting and four different insect motions (2 bugs flapping their wings, an inchworm inching and a frog hopping.)The light show and movements operate in conjunction with the music/soothing nature sounds.The first is the noise it makes while on the motion setting.The noise really isn't soothing at all.I would call it more of a cranking sound than anything.We rarely use the setting.Matter of fact, the only time we have used it is when our 3  year old adjusts the settings for her own entertainment.Our baby, on the other hand, is a little startled by the noise.The second drawback is that the soother requires 4 C batteries.I haven't used it enough to see how long they last, but it's still a lot of battery power for the little you get from the machine.My guess is it requires so much juice to crank the motors which "move" the fireflies around the night sky.Pros:Cute, whimsical designBrightly colored bugs that catch your child's attentionDifferent settings to allow for combinations of motion, lights and sound3 sound settings (low, medium and silent)Cons:Cost - too much for what you get, but it looks like many have gotten the hint and dropped their pricesBattery requirementsMotion setting makes noise that is not soothing at all, which means that it's really just a sound and lights machine.Less than desired music qualityOverall, I would say that we are disappointed with this product.While the promise of creating a relaxing baby retreat sounds great, the product fell short of delivering on that promise.The other one I have is the Fisher-Price Oceans Wonders Aquarium, which I believe has been discontinued.The Infantino Firefly Soother is super cute to look at.The music is much less annoying than most baby products.I particularly like the nature sounds myself.We use a monitor at night, so the nature sounds lull me to sleep as well as my baby.I would compare it to a white noise, sort of like a loud refrigerator.It actually seems to put my baby to sleep, but it is annoying to me.This crib toy does a lot and looks cute for a boy or girl.The only negative is that any lighted toy is a real battery eater!great item - purchased at a Target store.Bought for my nephew who uses it for tummy time, or just to throw down some toys to play.also good for the grass at the park, and its machine washable.These are ok, the lids have a tendency to pop off in the freezer.I probably wouldn't buy them again.I really wanted to love these but the lids don't stay on well.I like these food containers because they can be used in the freezer, microwave, and dishwasher, which not a lot of similar products can be.They also stack very well.They are small enough to stash away in random parts of the freezer, unlike some products where the individual food containers are all hooked together and so you have to make room in the freezer for a huge thing.The only problem I have with these is the same one that has been noted in most of the other reviews: the lids are not at all secure.I got these because my son loves popsicles and I wanted to make healthy ones for him with fresh juices & fruits.These are so easy to use and make, and have to say that they work really well for us and product is very durable!I have 4 of them and use them all the time.I was freaking out about making/storing my own baby food, but these nice, bendy trays made life a lot easier.Also, because they are kind of bendy, it isn't as hard to get out a single serving as I was thinking that it would be (if that makes sense).I recommend getting a book of simple baby food purees and a bunch of farmers market veggies, then freezing away!From the picture it looks almost like a see through green tray for the bottom.It isn't which to me is good.It is more of a rubber product that makes it easier to pop out your cubes of puree.The only thing is that there isn't a line inside the product to let you know where to fill it to, but I assume it should be 3/4 full to allow expansion.The top is a hard plastic top so that you can stack these in your freezer.Very helpful.It doesn't specify if you can put on the bottom shelf, but I didn't want to chance screwing something up.No shrinkage or warping.Very happy with the product.I was looking for a non-plastic option for freezing my babies' purees.The lid definitely does not seal, but for my purposes, it worked ok.Really wish I had the green or blue.It worked OK, but takes a while to detach.So overall, pretty good product, just not using it at all because I got a pink one, which doesn't work well when I have a boy.I give these four stars because they're quite solid, big, high, and I could just barely get them on my Graco Snap 'N Go stroller handle bar.You need to peel back the foam padding on the stroller bar in order to get this baby to clamp on.Minus one star because it JUST barely clamped on.They could have made it a tad bigger and included some cushioning foam piece to pad it in case some stroller handles are too thin.I recommend!I am so glad these were the cup holders we purchased!The handle on our jogging stroller is a bit thicker than most but these fit easily on the side.Simple solution to an obvious problem.We just did a 2000 mile road trip with our &lt;3 month old and he did fine in the car with these covers with no nasty red rub marks on the neck.We tried a pair from target that had little animals on them that were annoying and got in the way.We have been using it for the last 2 months and it fits great in her diaper bag.I use it for cloth diapering on the go.I also use it for my monthly needs.They are more secure and easier to install than the common drawer/cabinet lock mounted inside the door.As for function, these can't be beat!These locks are great for drawers especially if you don't want to drill in your cabinets.I only wish the adhesive was stronger since I've pulled the drawer without unlocking and the lock has come off.This lock is also great with side by side cabinet doors.This is the product we've been looking for.Our 17 month old toddler is in the 75th percentile in height but only in the 10th percentile in weight.So you can imagine pants that fit him on the waist are way too short and pants that are the right length will simply not stay on him.We've tried belts, but at this age things bunch up in all the wrong places.We use these daily now, since it has gotten cold and he can longer wear shorts.I would recommend buying two of these actually.They are easy to install and are machine washable.My 6 month old loves this mat.I have hardwood floors and needed something I could put my baby on to crawl around.I gave it four stars only because its a little slippery and when my baby is wearing pants he slides a bit.I found myself panicking when my daughter would drop her Nuk on the dirty floor time after time, which is really bad when you are out and about and only have a few nuks in your bag.These clip anywhere and stay on.She has never had any problem with them coming loose and they come in a bunch of great colors.They are thin and silky like a high-quality ribbon material and the velco is very secure.They are great to leave one clipped to the carseat or stroller.We were like Goldilocks and the Three Bears trying to find a stroller that worked for us.The first one was too big for our car (Evenlfo Aura), the second one was too flimsy(Cosco umbrella), the third one was just right (Snap & Go)... and then he grew out of the bucket seat that snapped into it, so we had to move up.I went to Buy Buy Baby and test drove every stroller I could get my hands on and ended up liking the Volo best for utility vs. price.The things I am not too fond of are: the basket is pretty small and when the baby is in the stroller, very hard to access, it tips over easily when I take the baby out if I have my diaper bag attached to the handles (I know, the price I pay for a very light stroller, but it's still a pain in the butt), the sunshade gets dirty because it touches the wheels when folded up (I read somewhere to grab a plastic grocery sack and throw it over the wheels when you are folding it up, I will probably do that once winter really shows up), there is no cup holder or little pockets or bins, and that d*mn circle-shaped harness lock took me 15 minutes to figure out (I can get it open really fast now, but those first couple times were not fun, especially with the little dude screaming and trying to get out)(also, the circle harness lock is on the newer models, if you buy a discontinued one they may have a different style that is easier to open- but probably easier for your toddler to open, also, which is why I imagine they changed it).Overall, I really like the stroller.My husband and I test-drove many umbrella strollers and found that we usually kicked the wheels (he is 6 feet tall, while I am 5'6"), but we don't with the Maclaren.Also, the handles are tall enough that he is not hunched over pushing the stroller.I do recommend getting the accessory pack, which also has a rain cover and carry-bag for the stroller.The basket under the seat in on the small side (forget about fitting a diaper bag in there) but I don't mind carrying the diaper bag because the stroller is so lightweight and manuverable.My only other issue is that the sun canopy does not tilt very far forward.Overall, we are very satisfied with the Maclaren Volo.They are easy to take with to hotels as well.We bought this for our 2 year old over active sleeper because we had to convert her crib into a toddler bed for potty training.She LOVES her crib and would squish up against differnt corners or sides of the crib throughout the night.Our bed has the toddler rail but it leaves an entry/exit gap as well as it not being high or long enough for the bumper.The magic bumper is perfect for the toddler bed.It's like having a bumper against the toddler rail that goes past the rail to the full extent of the crib.I also love that it tucks under the fitted sheet so it doesn't get in the way of the decor.I do wish it came with a storage bag but so far the bag it shipped in seems to do the trick.This product is a good alternative to the standard bed rails available which I think are an eyesore.My two year old daughter is a roller when she sleeps and we knew we needed some type of railing.This is much softer than the plastic or wood bed rails and this keeps her nestled snug in her bed!We have had the product a couple of months now and we have had no problems.We placed two along one side of our queen bed and one on each side of the toddler bed, to prevent falls.They are much longer than you would think so work quite well.These are simply wedges cut from foam with "magicbumper" stickers slapped on them.They came unwrapped and un-packaged (no plastic, nothing) inside the mailing envelope.While I am sure they were originally white, each wedge seemed to be at a different stage of yellowing.If you have the time and tools available, I would say go to the fabric store, buy some foam, and save yourself some money.If you have neither, buy these- functionally they're great.They arrived so quickly (ordered thursday night and arrived mon morning with w two day shipping) and I can tell they are going to help give us all some more sleep.These are super comfy and seem like they will totally do the trick!Best solution I've been able to find so far.Will update after a few nights sleep.Note: It was quoted to arrive by July 19th and came June 28, so their estimate was WAY off, much much fasterUpdate:  We've been using these for over a year now and still one of the best purchases.I will be buying a second set for my son and already have one at my mom's house.If these are off her bed for a night she has a horrible night sleep from bonking her head.these are a savior!If you are reading this review, are probably wondering if this bag is worth the $160 cost, especially since it is not real leather.The exterior of the bag gets an A for construction and quality PVC-free materials (warning: some scuffing will occur since there are no feet on this bag, but it can easily be covered up with a Sharpie).This bag also gets an A+ for style...I wouldn't even know it was a diaper bag if it wasn't for the the glaring Ju Ju Be front logo plate (wish it was smaller!).I pretty much always expect some sort of flaw, especially when a bag is produced in China - there is always something.Not so with this bag.The longer strap allows me to wear the bag crossbody (I'm 5'9 and strap extended long enough).Wish there were 2 bottle pockets, actually, since I already have a case for my sunglasses and don't need one to be built into my bag.In any event, this bag is nearly perfect: the only things I would really change are the pockets and interior layout - fewer pockets, and add few elasticized pockets for sippies, burp cloths, wallets, spare clothes.It is still a high quality bag, but the organization is in hyperdrive.Just wish the organization was better suited to my needs.This bag is the lightest thing I've ever had.It is very big so you can stuff sweaters, diapers, anything in there.I take the bus to go to work and am always bringing 2-3 bags with me.Purse, lunch bag and a bag for my magazines or other stuff.With this bag, I can stuff everything in.On the front you have two deep pockets(mini umbrella + 1 big klean kanteen), middle pocket goes halfway(bus card).On each side you have two loops to hang to stroller hooks.It closes with a snap.You have those nice crumb drains on each corner.The big compartment loses with 2 snaps.I love these bibs and have been using them a long time.My daughter can get almost any bib off be it velcro or over the head type.This bib she cannot get off so it saves our little clothes!Easy to clean by wiping off little messes or washing out in the sink with soap and water and let air dry.Cute designs and great construction and the snap closure is the best.After he makes a mess, the bib is easy to rinse off and then hang to dry.I don't have to worry about it staining or washing it in the washing machine.It is easy and convenient.major flaw is if it is sunny outside.you have to retract the sunshade to use it properly [both on the duallie and the single].when doing so, the sun goes directly into your child's eyes.i feel for the money, they could have designed it so the sunshade doesn't need to retract or the opening is lower.i mainly use this when it is super cold, rainy, and clouded.if it is sunny i drape a blanket over the top portion of the plastic window.sometime i rig it so the sunshade remains down, the fit is awkward- but it saves the babies' eyes.usually though, if it is sunny and frigid, i skip the weather shield altogether and just bundle them up.other than that, it is simple to use-on in seconds.seems durable and made well.It can fit the 10" step-lid pail I leave at school for my toddler's cloth diapers (holds 4 easily, 5 in a pinch).No smell when I take it home every night.I prefer this clip design and not having to use the shoulder harness is a nice change since out 19 month old no longer needs them.This looks exactly like the mam bottles he was using.A sippy cup is supposed to teach them how to drink sips out of a cup.This is just like using a bottle.In fact, it looks a lot like a bottle.Everyone thought I put him back onto a bottle.I think this one will take the back of the cupboard for a while.My 15 month old grandson would not drink milk from a cup or a sippy cup - as with another reviewer, this is the only way we could get him to drink milk again!Hey, it works and we figure he'll switch to a cup when he's ready, meanwhile it's not a bottle AND it does not leak!Also it really is spill proof (unless your 9 month old place with the nipple by squeezing and bending it whilst they have it upside down...)I have a four month old that thoroughly enjoys being in this jumper.She is a little too short for it despite being in the 84th percentile for height.I place a rolled up blanket under her feet and she does well.There are a lot of activities to engage the little ones and my baby is just getting a hang of the rotating seat.So though she is not quite able to jump yet, she is enjoying the rest of the jumper for sure.I am excited to see her grow into this!The only negative thing about it is that it is a bit heavy and doesn't easily fold for storage, but that's like most baby equipment anyway.At first his feet couldn't touch the ground on the lowest height setting.A week after the original purchase date we had to adjust to the next height setting.I don't think my son is growing that fast, so there is some adjustment with weight and use on the tension of the cables.The other minor issue is that one of the purple keys would not snap on in place, so that part of the jumperoo barely gets any action.He has outgrown the jumperoo.I consider this a pretty expensive toy and many times while he wasn't mobile he was happy to sit in his pack and play with a lot of different toys.We use it during "difficult" times when a diaper needs to be changed and he doesnt want to or when he is being toweled off and dressed after bath.As soon as he hears the turtle he stops crying and listens intently.Now the Lion.I only discovered this after tearing off the packaging material, so I can not exchange it.This toy is fun and cute.Babies can roll it along the ground to hear fun sounds or make the animals pop up.It's better than other pop up toys because it can be played with as a rolling vehicle as well.The animals pop up easily and also go back down easily.One of them you smack down, the other is a knob you push, and the other is a key like shape that you twist.All of these result in the characters popping up out of the top of the plane.It is sort of like a jack in the box, but much easier for her to manipulate than the other pop up toys.This toy has alot of features of similar toys but using them on an airplane is totally unique and my daughter loves to play with this toy.It's not loud enough to get my baby's attention.It says "Hello" in several languages, but since the volume is low it would be very difficult for a baby to try to understand/distinguish the languages.Also, it appears that the antenna should light up, which it does not.It is a cute toy but the sound is very low.I have a standard heavy duty bulb (the one you get from the hospital) and the nosefrida snot sucker.I recommend the Nosefrida snot sucker also sold by amazon.com.The cardboard was torn and it was covered in packing tape.Also on the comb there are black spots and they seem very cheaply made.I suppose I will try to clean them and just be stuck.Much better deal than I've found in baby stores.The towels look cute, but the fabric doesnt really seem good, but what can you get for this price?although this is a great idea, the containers aren't big enough for much more other than formula.They definitely weren't big enough to hold snacks for my 18 month old.Ended up returning it.It's a great size for putting things like cubed cheese, diced up grapes, ritz crackers, small portions of pasta, etc.My one problem with this is that it's made for snacks and/or formula, so there's a raised area in the bottom of each compartment to accomodate the pour spout of the top below it.It seems like a small detail, but it would just be so much easier to clean it every night if each compartment was just a plain old container with a flat bottom that screwed to each other.I bought these after I tried 2 other brands of training cups, which my twins really hated and refused to drink from.The big plus about this cup is that you can drink from it without raising it, which is much easier for babies.It doesn't spill and the straw is very easy to use.I was hesitant to buy these because there were no reviews but I liked that they were simple, no toys attached and not reversible- priced right also.Upon receiving them (I got 2, one for my 2 year old and one for my baby when she arrives) they looked great!They are well sewn and very soft.We installed them in our daughters car seat (Evenflo Triumph Advance) and they were very wide but I'm a crafty person so I can fix it pretty easily, just haven't yet.She loves that they are soft- she kept rubbing her face on them, and when she fell asleep they did the job and kept the straps from cutting into her neck, also looked like they acted as a small pillow.All in all they are perfect.My daughter looooves to play and lick on these keys.She can't quite put them in her mouth.So, we end up taking the keys away and giving her the pacifier.If you are looking for a durable, easy-to-assemble, versatile stroller, this is awesome.The included seat can be turned either forward-facing, or rear-facing, depending on your needs (or the direction of the sun or wind.It includes a nice under storage area for the diaper bag, an area where you can store odds and ends (must be removed for the second seat), and even a cup holder for the Mom on the run!The instructions for assembly were clear (just pop together instructions) and I had the stroller up and running in just a few minutes.I'm used to children climbing in and out by themselves as soon as they are toddlers, and this seems a bit high for them to do safely.The included seat is designed for age 6 months to 55 pounds, so it should handle the larger weight of a toddler.However, if you purchase the 2nd seat (the lower one) it holds from birth to 35 pounds.So if you have a toddler and baby, you will want to place the baby in the lower seat, and the toddler in the upper seat.The weight of the box (when shipped) is 35 pounds, or if you order the combination with both seats Britax U281772KIT1 B-Ready Stroller and Black 2nd Stroller Seat - Black, the combined shipping weight is 45 pounds.That's a BIG heavy box to show up for a new Mom to struggle with, so I suggest ordering it and assembling it for her.I have removed one star because of the difficulty of carrying it in a standard car without a lot of extra hassle.Just in the first week of using it, many people have asked about it and expressed their envy.The designed brake system works smoothly with an easy touch of just one foot (to apply and also release) and allows you to clearly see its status through a green or red color indicator.It also folds up easily and stands up on its own (using a single seat).The second seat is nice for times my older child needs to ride because she's sick and I have to walk to pick up another child at school.I wish it could be easily removed like carseat covers and washed on gentle, but not possible.So if you have the double seat in you cannot reach that console at all.sure you can set it up for one baby, and a growing babyor you could make another

cartnice pramdurableflexiblemakes it worthwhile to keep someone around to help outgood carriage, very versatileand strongworth making more babies forLike most moms I have had a menagerie of strollers but this Britax B-Ready is definitely the cream of the crop.It took me all of 4 minutes to put it together.My Favorite Things:- Seat can be easily changed from forward to backward facing.- Wheel brake is exceptionally easy to use...just push the pedal with your foot.- Push handle can be adjusted to accomodae parents of all heights.It's a jogging stroller!- Both seats (upper & lower, second seat) easily accomodate older toddlers.(He actually likes the lower seat more!Georgeous design!My Not-So Favorite Things:- This is a big stroller.I think it would be difficult to take this on car trips just because of the lost packing space for luggage in the car...atleast in my car, with my packing habits ;)-It's heavy.I'm a small person so it's slightly difficult to lift up into the back of my car due to it's size and weight.- Folding and Opening takes some getting use to since it is such a large stroller.You really should practice folding this stroller on the carpet to get the hang of it.Otherwise, you risk scratching up the handle and lower silver bar.All of my mom friends (and even my husband!)have been thoroughly impressed.It's like Britax looked at all the things that are wrong with other strollers and created solutions for them with this one stroller.Simply genius!Rather than cataloging this stroller's features, I recommend watching Hollie Shultz's video review which does a superior job of running through features and operating instructions.Even though I agree with the other reviewers that the Britax B-Ready overall is an excellent stroller, at $500 base price plus more for accessories I am going to nit-pick in a way I wouldn't with a less expensive stroller, which is also why I gave it 4 stars.This stroller is very easy to push and steer, even with just one hand, and has an excellent ride - until you leave pavement.All of my other strollers have had obvious and easy places to grab them once folded flat but the bars of this stroller are so close together when folded that it's hard to find a good place to grab it and lift it.Related to that is the latch that holds the stroller closed - ours has to be snapped in place manually.My Peg Perego Si has this same feature but the shoulder and waist straps click securely to each other, so I don't have to hold the two pieces together to get them buckled.The last two complaints are small issues that I may not even mention if reviewing a less expensive stroller, but the first complaint is something that dictates which stroller I choose when heading out with my baby.This is by far the best stroller I have ever had.The adjustable handle on the Britax B-Ready is a wonderful feature.I now run a home child care, and care for children from 6 weeks to 4 years old.It is very easy to change from a toddler seat to an infant seat.Even with being a double stroller it maneuvers one handed.The fabric is the easiest to clean.Just wipe it down with a wet cloth.Assembly couldn't be any easier.No tools required.Some differences with Uppababy Vs. Britax B-Ready:WHEELS - Vista wins.Vista had better wheels.Vista had tread and were more grippery tire like feel.B-Ready also had fenders on them which seem to add to bulk.Comparing closely it almost appear one could put Vista's wheels to B-Ready.It's that similar!HANDLE - B-Ready wins.Handle on B-Ready was nicer than Vista.It pivoted instead of telescoping (which was what the Vista does).The arms and wrist seem more comfortable (rested more parallel like on a keyboard).My wife at 5'2 found the Vista handle too high and wished it could adjust lower.FOLDING - Vista wins (barely).Comparing the two, the wife like the Vista (it did take several attempts for wife to get the feel for it, as did I !Once figured out it was ok).B-Ready  required two hands as well but you sort of have to use your stomach so that you could pull the levers toward you and have  it collapse.I found it easy if you have larger hands you can pull down the levers easier but since my wife is 5'2, her hands are smaller and sort of used her stomach a bit.With time, I think she could avoid using her stomach.She would just hold the bar and use her fingers to pull down.We also found that you had to straighten out the B-Ready's handle so that when you fold it, it would stand properly stand up and you could lock the folding clasp.DEFINITELY TRY FOLDING IT YOURSELF IN THE STORE!Both stands up when folded although you have to consciously stand it up.The sales person always seems to fold it and let it flop to the ground.I doubt one  would do that outside.Note on second seat folding - The folding of the B-Ready allows the second seat to be on but it was very bulky (and heavy at a total of 35 lbs) and the canopy of the second seat would get dirty.So while the  B-Ready has a handle that is more ergonomically correct for mom's wrist, it seems the seat upright capability is better for the kid.Recline of 2nd child add on - B ready  was clearly better since it can recline to horizontal sleeping position.It was not upright but slightly tilted back.A taller person may hit the B-Ready seat with their stride but I'm 5'10 and its not a problem.Big difference here!I don't think I would want to have a Vista recline in front and therefore exposing the child's head.STORAGE - B-Ready wins (barely).Vista's is on the rear only.However, the Vista has a bar running across where the kid can sort of step their feet on.The B-Ready has their feet in the entire basket and the kids would probably kick at your diaper bag.CONFIGURATIONS - B-Ready wins.B-Ready has 14 configurations vs. Vista's 3 configurations.You can also place infant carrier in the rear (Vista you cannot.You can only put it in the front).Vista cannot use bassinet with rear seat.After all this, I am still having problems deciding.For me, it comes down to Vista's 0 degree position but no full recline in rear seat Vs. B-Ready's full recline rear seat but lack of 0 degree position.Edit:Update - I ended up buying the Britax B-ready.It's been used it for 6 weeks now.It can be bumpy on cobble stones and uneven surfaces.If you want a smoother ride on these surfaces, you'll need bigger, air-filled tires.When unfolding, the plastic clip that holds the stroller , is tricky to "undo" so you can unfold it.You need to pull it out a bit before you unfold which can be tough.I'll report back in a few more months.We had to go ahead and move our 6 month old daugher up to convertible car seat and with all the great reviews about Britax and the smaller footprint of the Roundabout than many others, which we needed due to our smaller car (2 door G6)it seemed the logical choice.Overall I am really happy with our decision but there are a few things I wish were a bit different.Pros:-Great material, soft and plush and cleans up easily.-Love the velcro on the straps that holds them to the side of the chair to make them easier to get when putting the baby in.- Like the padding around the crotch strap, for a girl not a huge thing but probably great for a little guy.- Feels solid and well constructed I can easily see this lasting thru 2 or 3 kids.-As I mentioned it has one of the smaller footprints of the large convertible carseats.Even rearfacing we actually got back quite a bit of front leg room space when we put this in and took out our Snugrider.Cons:- The location of the reclining mechanism is terrible, if you have the carseat rear facing you abslolutely can not adjust the recline without uninstalling the whole seat since the mechanism is jammed up against the seat of your car when installed and thus inaccessible.- While I know that the raised sides are better for side impact protection they make getting an infant in and out while the seat is rear facing much harder than it should be.I'm sure it will be fine once she is front facing but for the mean time it is frankly a pain.- The Latch mechanism, I would much rather have just a simple little hook like I did on my old Graco Snugrider than these awkward trigger latchs they have on the Roundabout.I have only had this installed for a few days, but so far so good.I don't anticipate any problems, except I am a little concerned about the cover not being machine washable, but I guess I will just throw it in the bathtub with some warm water and detergent when we need to, and hope that it dries by morning.update: 2 months later I still think this seat is great.I will be using this as our primary car seat, replacing theBritax Advocate 65 CS Click & Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx.I will be comparing the two.APPEARANCEThe seat looks very classy and high end with a black/gray nylon-type material (great for cleaning up messes) as opposed to the cloth of the Marathon 65.You could easily remove it in under a minute and install in two minutes.FEATURESIt has a removable insert that hugs the back and sides of a very small baby, which covers one of the complaints I had with the Marathon 65.In the Marathon 65, there is a shoulder pad on the seatbelt to protect the baby's neck, shoulder and cheek from rubbing the seatbelt.The one supplied had to be put in one direction and wasn't very soft.This seat has a 360 degree super-soft shoulder pad.Very nice!In the Marathon 65, if you needed to raise the seatbelt (when the baby gets too tall for the setting), you would need to remove the seat from the car, unclip the belt on the back, pull the belt out the front and then thread them back in another set of slots, like most car seats.On this seat, it has a fantastic mechanism on top that you squeeze and it just moves the seat belt up and down without ever removing the seat!This one is not, but I suppose you can just put it underneath.There are velcro sections on the left and right seatbelt to stick it out of the way to the side of the seat.On the old seat, the sections of velcro were too small and it was hard to get them to stay out of the way.It is worse in this seat, where the velcro is largely ineffective at keeping the seatbelt from under the baby.I'm going to try to engineer my own solution to this problem...The tightening strap is smaller than the 65 and it is more difficult to get to the loosening latch due to a smaller hole in the cover.Also, this model doesn't click when tightening the strap.Overall, I really love this seat and would recommend it to everyone with a child under 70 pounds.The safety and convenience of this seat are just top notch.Since 2001 I've been hooked on Britax car seats.When I was presented with the opportunity to review the Britax Marathon 70,  I jumped at the chance.We own a Britax Marathon that accommodates a child from 5 to 65 pounds, so it was nice to sit the two seats side by side for comparison purposes.The seat belt lock offs are designed differently (I think they're more cumbersome than the easy to use lock offs found on the Britax Marathon and Roundabout seats).Instead of pressing down, you need to press up.After nearly 9 years of dealing with seats that had easier releases, I found this to be a tad awkward.Harness height adjustment on the Marathon 70 is a snap compared to the seats where you need to rethread the harness.You simply have to squeeze and pull (or push) to adjust the height of the harness straps.The Marathon 70 also boast some nice little touches that weren't found on the old Marathon.There is now a place to snap the latch clips to the back of the seat when not in use.We've been using Britax's older style Marathons for five years so I was anxious to try this latest manifestation to see how it stacked up.Like the older Britax models, the new Marathon is often outgrown by height, rather than weight.Some of the newer head protecting technology from other, more expensive Britax seats has been integrated.My four year old gave this her seal of approval comfort-wise, declaring the new design even better than her old one.There are new spots to store latch clips when they are not in use that I love, most every change is a great improvement with the exception of the locking mechanisms for using a seat belt.They are MUCH harder to use than they were on the older model Marathons.I assume that they are also safer, but I had such a hard time with it, I could imagine parents using it incorrectly (and unsafely.)The instructions are clear and easy to follow, but take advantage of seat checks in your area to make sure you install it correctly and as secure as it can be.After being disappointed by Graco's quality of car seats, I decided to try Britax!I'm 5'1 and 105 lbs and I can sit in the seat (not harnessed of course) with the headrest at its highest.The Graco Nautilus' furthest crotch strap measured at 6.5 inches from the back... one of the main reasons I returned it cause my son would have no room to grow into and would inevitably be sitting on the crotch strap before he's even 2 years old.You just move the headrest up and down!No need to unfasten the harness and re-thread it through the loops.Graco Nautilus' recline was like half an inch difference.I think all car seats should be made of a steel frame.Which makes this car seat, though very expensive, worth the money in every way!!!And I'm pretty frugal.From now on, every car seat I buy will be a Britax!I ordered the Britax Marathon 70 car seat for my son who was outgrowing his infant car seat (the Chicco Keyfit 30).I have a small car (BMW 328i) and wasn't sure that there would be enough room for the Britax.However, the new models are slimmer in design and the Marathon doesn't take up any room than the Chicco car seat.Marathon Pros:1.Has 2 buckle positions and extra padding around the buckle.5.Easy to clean (the cover is machine washable).6.Higher rear-facing weight and height limits (40lbs and 49in).The only con is that the seat is quite heavy, which would make it hard to switch between cars.The only other thing I don't like is that my son's head slumps forward when he falls asleep in this car seat.This is a fantastic car seat.My 11-month old son weighs 28 pounds and has a long torso, and he is very comfortable.We frequently take 5-hour car trips to visit grandparents, and he is so much more comfortable in this than he was in the baby carrier.Very spacious.The seat is no more or less difficult to use than any other brand/model, but it is by far the safest seat made.It is well built and the fabric feels soft.We mounted it on the back passenger-side seat.This item was not available in stores near our home for us to try it before we buy it.I highly recommend that you actually  install this and try it before you commit and buy it.My baby was 4 and half months old when she started hating sitting in her infant car seat for long trip.So we decided to upgrade her car seat to something that sits more upright.I am a mom who will spend extra to buy the best when it comes to safety so this car seat fits the bill.Britax advertised that you can put newborn in it.So considering my baby was over 15lbs at that time, we didn't think it would be a problem for her to sit in it.Well, not quite.First of all, she is too short to reach the "true impact" side protection even after I adjusted it.Second, for a baby who cannot sit up completely unassisted, she couldn't really control her neck or body as well as a 8 month old does.So when we went for a 35 min drive and she fell in sleep, her whole head leaned forward and almost touched her tummy.She looked like a bended ball!So I know she is not ready for it yet.Now she is nearly 6 months old, we will probably try it again in a few weeks.I am sure for older babies, this is the best seat you can buy.The fact that it holds up to 70 lbs is really great.That means, one car seat all the way to 4,5 years old!I am looking forward to use it full time.But for now, she is in her infant seat.update:Now my daughter is 9 months old.She now weights 20+ lbs and her height is at 95%, but she is still only taking half of the space, if not less so I definitely see the room to grow into this chair.To put her in rear facing position is pain especially in winter.But I think it will be the same with other convertible car seat.We drive her to the mountains so I am very comforting to know that she is well protected.I have the previous model Britax Boulevard in my wife's car which we both like very much.I bought the new Boulevard 70 version for my car.It's also a little bit smaller so it fits nicely in my car.You can't go wrong with this seat, and you'll feel good knowing it's such a safe car seat.My favorite aspect, which sets this car seat apart from the others is the side impact head cushions.Many car seats, including other Britax models do not have side impact protection.So far, so pretty-good with the Boulevard for us.However, the seat has some drawbacks that really shouldn't exist considering its exorbitant price.- The seat is easy to install, but very heavy and very large.It fits, but I don't think we will be able to use the same model as a second seat in our smaller sedan.- The straps twist CONSTANTLY which, again, shouldn't be an issue since this was a $300 car seat.Seriously, they couldn't have solved that problem with a small fraction of my purchase price?They are also difficult to keep out of the way while setting my little guy in the seat, so I have to dig them out from under him (before untwisting them) almost every time.I almost have to hold him at arms length, drop him in and then lean around the seat and into the car to fasten the harnesses.Super annoying.- I have not yet tried to remove the seat fabric for cleaning (and after reading some of the other reviews, I am not eager to try it) but the top buckle is a pain in the neck to clean if anything gets in it.The purpose is for a second car seat in our other car.It was easy to install in just a few minutes and works very similar to the other Britax car seat we own.The pattern is also very nice and matches well with gray interior.This model is about 6 pounds lighter than the older version we have, which makes a difference because we travel with it a lot in airplanes and rental cars.Also, this model has a place to hook the latches so they do not get caught or damaged when traveling.Definitely recommend this product for safety ratings and good looks.I absolutely love this car seat.We also bought one in the "Emily" fabric for our other car...i like the silver birch much better.Also, the Emily fabric is a little too salmon pink for me...its a bit bright.Anyway, i would highly recommend this car seat to anyone!This has to be one of the best car seats out on the market.It was easy to install and the Advocate definitely puts a lot of thought into crash safety.When the seat arrived, I just pulled it out of the box (nothing to put together) and quickly installed into my car.Also, it is extremely easy to adjust the harness which on my old car seat was a pain and involved process.It is well worth the extra money and will be the last car seat you will need to purchase.The front seats had to be scooted up concomfortably close to the dash and the car seat was still not 100% level to ground due to the length of the car seat.Probably every other time I put her in our took her out I was untwisting those *!A safety issue--no.But a real pain in the butt when errand running is already inconvenient enough--yes.3) in the beginning, my daughter cried every time I put her in it.The seat is very cushy yet supportive and the adjustable straps are definitely a plus.This car seat is simply a cut above the rest.Yes, it is heavy (21 pounds), but it weighs less than my daughter so that is not an issue for me.And yes, it is expensive but in my opinion a car seat is not an area to look for a bargain.The reason why we decided to go with this car seat is that it simply had ALL the features we were looking for - Safety being the top priority, comfort, ease of installation and not to mention stylish!The safety features are simply the best (I won't bore you with all the details since you can read it on the Britax website) - every part of the car seat is well thought out and designed!The car seat is solid (steel frame- nothing feels or looks flimsy!)and well made.When I took it out of the box to prep for installation, I read through the instructions, familiarized myself with all the parts, visited the website to look at the how-to videos.Once equipped with the information, it was a cinch to install.It took me less than 15 mins to get the carseat installed and secured.Another excellent time saving idea!In my opinion, the attention to these types of details is what makes Britax stands out.Since this is only month 1 owning this, we'll have to reserve comment on its durability and ease of care until a later date.I can't afford a bigger car right now so it was this car seat that I thought would suit us best.He can even now look outside the window where as before he couldn't and cry everytime we put him in his infant seat.I can even take this seat from car to car with out any hassle.It stands upright (I found sagging diaper bag annoying), has two very large bottle holders (big enough for adult drinks), a mommy's/daddy's pocket in the front with 2 mesh pockets, and spacious main compartment with one zippered pocket, 2 small open pockets, and one large open pocket.The grab handle on the top is very handy.I just wish it has an extra storage pocket on the outside and padding on the back.The back doesn't have additional padding.If the designer place a pouch on the back(either inside or outside of the bag) to place the change pad in, it would provide some cushion for the back.Or the designer should just add cushion like normal backpack would have on the back.Loud enough to hear, but not overly annoying.I have nothing negative to say about this cute, colorful stacker.The rings are each a different shape, and I think that is a real improvement over other ring stackers.The only thing that kept this from getting 5 stars is that only the top shape has a rattle in it.The beaded plastic end makes a fun teething ring.My 6 month old child loves toys with detail, like tags and prints and she finds this very appealing.He disliked the sippy cups with the hard plastic spout, so I was looking for a soft silicone spout.I read a lot of reviews for another Nuby soft spout sippy cup, but I couldn't find it anywhere in stores(it was way too $$$ on amazon, and couldn't get it from another site).I saw this one (2 pack) at the store and decide to give it a try since there wasn't much of a selection of soft spouts to choose from.Well, I was very happy that my son drinks his milk out of this sippy cup!I put his formula and water in the sippy cup and shake it like crazy and nothing -- not a single drop of milk comes out!Thanks to this sippy cup, the bottles are washed and put away.No baby yet (a few more weeks).It is a bit pricey for what it is (standard plastic), however you can tell a lot went into the design of the product.Okay, so it seems a little gross at first.Not to worry...your mouth stays clear of the boogies.Think of it as a fine aiming missile tackling those hard to reach boogers.The other type on the market sucks everything in sight...not as effective.I can aim and suck with this thing and clear her passages like a pro.A must...if you get over the concept.Both my husband and I HATE this one so much that we actually avoid using it.When we are holding our baby and trying to shake the formula out into a bottle, it often ends up spilling onto the counter because of the flat lid.The opening on our Munchkin dispensers has a slightly funnel shaped lid that lets the formula slide out with minimal tapping.ONE STAR for the fact that it has 4 compartments instead of 3.The Sassy dispenser would have been a waste of money, had we purchased it ourselves.Get the Munchkin dispenser instead.The munchkin formula dispenser is lower profile, and has 3 compartments to portion out formula, while this one is much taller and has 4 compartments.To get all of the formula powder into the bottle you have to set the dispenser in the mouth of the bottle and shake it back and forth.This can be difficult to do with a baby in one arm and just measuring out the formula is actually easier in those situations.The lid stays closed and secure for travel so there will be no unexpected spills.The formula doesn't stay in its compartments.I started out with four compartments of formula and ended up with two nearly empty compartments and two nearly full compartments.I no longer had properly measured out formula and it was a disaster.I tossed it that day.I bought this when my daughter was 3 or 4 months old, since her head would always fall forward when sleeping and it drove me crazy!She also had reflux and I had heard that it was good for that, too.She never really liked being in her car seat, she would scream if she was in it too long.Initially, this solved the problem.Her head no longer fell as much (still did sometimes) and she seemed happier in the car.But, I didn't like how the seat belt became much shorter with this thing in the seat.It made it harder to get my daughter in and out of the seat, and she would cry because of it.When she got to about 7 months, she started screaming again in the car and really seemed unhappy in her seat.One day my mom suggested that I take out the SnugginGo and maybe she'd be more comfortable.So I did, and ever since she hasn't screamed again!Once my baby got older, it got awfully tight in the car seat when she was in it.I don't know how a bigger baby would fit.Overall, I think this is a great product for newborns and young infants, under 6 months of age.I was really excited when our local stores started to carry these bags.However, in the first 10 bags I used, I had 3 that leaked - immediately.Was very disappointed with the quality and will not be purchasing them again.Good material, well done, soft enough for the baby.Best of all, the baby enjoys it as much as grown ups do.A little bulky and the PUL seems thin, like the snaps could rip through.I returned this in favor of another pocket diaper.My baby loves munching this sucking pad as well as the shoulder strap.These pads prevent frequent washing of the carrier itself.However, I still think they're too pricey for what they are.I bought these as soon as I noticed my son was mouthing the Ergo straps.I ordered the Mocha colored ones because I was concerned about stains showing.However, the vendor in charge of fulfilling the order sent me the cream ones.Nice and stretchy 100% cotton terry, then can also be used for a "sweatband" when wearing the carrier with a tank top.Overall a wonderful accessory for your Ergo carrier!I got tired of winding my son's crib mobile, so I bought this one.There are no parts to assemble (beyond the crotch bar) and with a few clicks here and there, you can take the joovy nook anywhere.Cons:We have owned the Joovy for only a couple months now, but so far there is nothing that I find negative about this productThe Joovy Nook has been quite durable and amazingly easy to use.I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a stylish product that's easy to use and even more easy to move and/or store.I absolutely love these bags!Ju Ju Be has thought of everything!I've been looking at tons of different brands, etc for a great diaper bag, but couldn't find anything that met the requirements (even in very high end designer bags) until I happened upon Ju Ju Be bags.I got the BFF bag in Black/Silver, and love its classic look.These bags were selling out at all local carriers so I'm sooo glad I found this on Amazon!In all of their bags they use Teflon, so it wipes clean, the interior is light colored so that it does not become the stereotypical mom bag black hole, plus its treated with agion so bacteria won't grow inside your bag if items are spilled.Plus the entire bag is machine washable!They also use metal hooks, etc instead of cheapy plastic pieces that break.Because this bag is so well made, it seems like it will really hold up over time, which is a major plus in such an expensive diaper bag.And I love how they have designed the bags with the mom in mind, with a foam change pad, and a mommy pocket!This bag really will become your BFF!See Ju Ju Be's website for videos and descriptions of the inside of the bag!They also make many cute accessories to go with it, which I wish Amazon online would carry ALL of the Ju Ju Be product line.It is a good ju ju be bag.I am coming from owning three ju ju be bags: packabe, between, and BFF.I also own many other diaper backpacks.This is a good messenger bag and is as good as the ju ju be video describes except:  The bag is flawed as a backpack.The bag will pull away from you on the top, while the bottom of the bag pokes at your spine.Because of that, the bag looks stupid and sagging in the backpack mode.I realized this is a design flaw.If ju ju be positions the top set of rings(where the backpack straps hook onto) further up/higher up, it will alleviate this problem somewhat.If you watched the ju ju be video, the demonstrator has to hold both straps with both hands to prevent the bag from sagging down.I called ju ju be about this.They said this is the first run of the BFF bags so we are the testers.They will let the design team know.Otherwise a very good messenger bag.It's not too big or too small and has tons of pockets.I am thinking about taking this bag to a tayler and has it altered by repositioning the top rings as high as possible.But that is going to cost extra $ for an expensive bag already!I had a few medela bottles (5 oz) that came with my newborn feeding set/pump.I needed some supplements to the storage situation, so I got these.These are MUCH higher quality- much thicker plastic, with "molded" oz markings instead of the writing.I liked the writing because I could easily see (even during low light night feedings) what he was eating, as I always keep track.The product is ok.We were able to nail and glue the part back into place without there being an obvious repair.Since the damage was minor and we did not discover it until the product was nearly assembled we did not bother to return it.I purchased this product because I had bought the matching crib.The finish is nearly identical to that of the crib and the set looks good in the nursery.UPDATE- a few months after we starting using the dresser the handles started to pull off and have to be glued on.The drawers will not slide well if pulled slightly crooked.Its still a functional dresser but I wouldn't buy it again unless there was a very good sale.We purchased this after being disappointed in the Baby Bjorn travel crib, the Phil & Ted's traveller, and the Kidco Peapod.The Baby Bjorn is huge and must be checked(so it ends up costing more after just a few trips), the P&T's was made of noisy material that woke the baby, and the Peapod looks like a collapsible dog kennel.Easy to set up, easy to take down.You can carry it on the airplane with you, no paying extra to check a crib, no worrying the airline will lose it because it's checked.We got this for our 12 month old who actually does not like sleeping in the pack and play.It set up easily after reading the instructions (which I recommend doing).I tried to use a target brand pack and play sheet on the mattress and it was too tight and made the mattress collapse.I am planning to try to make a sheet with some velcro to hold it in place.Planned to do the same with my twin girls but at 10 months our drier died, I got snowed under with laundry and sucked into a 'sposie slump, and there was no going back.Now pregnant with #4 and I want to do him in cloth the easier, hip, modern way - bought some BGs and Fuzzibuns one-size to use on my girls for now to figure out what I like.Stuffing them takes more time than laying a bunch of prefolds flat but not nearly as much time as running to the store for diapers.And getting them stuffed and stacked JUST SO soothes the OCD side of me (which you wouldn't know I had, to look around my house...)Getting them ON the baby is no more work than a disposable - no taking off shoes and pants to deal with pull on pants, no seperate cover, etc.Fast and easy.Fairly trim.Wash very well - I got the snap ones as I know from past experience dealing with those velcro diaper snakes is NO FUN.I can see it being more adjustable, but the snaps make for a nice appearance and will hold up well over time.So far even on the pale green (sweet) cover, poo stains come out 100%.(And hopefully past 4.0 there won't be many ways to improve - seriously, how could they be better???- so I can sell them and get a large portion of my $$$ back)Questionable on the absorbancy - they work pretty well for 2, slightly over 2 hours - but it can get dicey and I am still not convinced there's any way to beat a prefold for how much it will hold with how trim it is.I am still getting in the swing of not being able to go hours and hours in disposables...Take up a lot of room in a diaper bag - hence my wanting to try Flips, I suspect they will be easier to travel with, as well as more versatile.Admittedly, travelling with these for ONE baby won't be as bad as for 2.(But if I do end up with 3 in dipes at once, I may need to trade in my diaper bag for a carry-on bag with wheels LOL...)Elastic is supposed to be replacable but I don't know how yet - it's SUPER easy in the Fuzzibuns, seems more complicated in these.I was using Charlie's Soap and I had stinky dipes.Many moms admit to switching to Tide - gasp!But if I had, I probably would have gotten the velcro ones, and these are so much better - it's just as well.BumGenius has almost caught up with FuzziBuns with the introduction of the new 4.0 version.All the things that made FuzziBuns far superior, BumGenius borrowed for this design.The availability of snaps means that you can use your diapers for a second child (the velcro does NOT last on velcro tabs of any brand - DO NOT GET VELCRO) and active babies don't rip off their snap diapers (wrangling them into the snaps, of course, is why some people like velcro - but not so great when they choose to rip off velcro and do their business on the nice rug).The biggest improvement is the replaceable elastic - something FuzziBuns introduced a while back.This is the number one reason my older cloth diapers "pooped" out (and I mean that in oh so many ways).So, the remaining differences (and here I'm talking about the latest versions of both - November 2010):I think FuzziBuns are softer and stay softer after washing.I think BumGenius stay drier longer.I think BumGenius are better for bigger babies (the FuzziBuns fit my ginourmous second child fine still, but I wonder exactly what is going to happen when he's 3 given that he weighs almost 30 pounds and is not yet 1).I think BumGenius are much more difficult to wash (the pocket has an end flap.When you use the BumGenius sprayer - which rocks BTW - all the poop gets caught in the pocket.If you spray toward the closed end of the pocket, the water gets in but takes forever to drain out so my wash bucket gets all full of water and the "waterproof" BumGenius liner eventually leaks.The FuzziBuns spray off much easier, no poop goes in the pocket, and they don't hold so much water) and tend to hold smell longer (they need to be stripped more often).With the new 4.0 version, I think the difference is mostly preference - but I'm sticking with FuzziBuns as my primary diaper.Enables me to walk the dog & take baby w/o the bulk of a stroller.other reasons for choosing this version are: the material (hubs is always hot & I know if we had a cotton one he would be less willing to use it), color is neutral and dark enough to hide minor scuffs, easy to clean, & has the pocket in front for easy access to keys/phone/credit cards.Quality is top notch.The only issues I have are: that I have a newborn and I am always worried about suffocation especially with the colder weather and having to wear bulkier clothing.I had an issue with this the other day... Midway through my walk the insert strap loosened and the baby had slumped downward leaving baby's nose/mouth covered by chest and spine completely unsupported.The other issue is when trying to correct this problem away from the safety of home, had difficulty adjusting right lower strap.Maybe I'm just a weekling and perhaps I did something wrong to cause this.Never experienced it before but it's something to keep in mind.Otherwise, this is a well-crafted product that enables you to get things done...and always puts the little one to sleep.I look forward to using it when she's a bit older and I don't have to worry about her breathing so much.I originally had the Baby Bjorn Sport..which I thought was wonderful..until...I tried my friends Ergo.I put my baby in there and she seriously fell asleep within 10 minutes!I was SOLD!!She never falls asleep that fast and that soundly.In addition, my back wasn't hurting nearly as much as it does with the Bjorn.I quickly got online to purchase one.I purchased the Ergo Performance (which is made with a more breathable material and is 30% lighter than the original).They shipped it to me instantly and I fell in love with it immediately.:) I would highly recommend this product.Oh, I also LOVE the zipper pocket (makes traveling much easier) and the tuck away hood (for those sunny or rainy days).I purchased the original Ergo, then returned it and purchased the performance instead.This one is lighter weight and more breathable making it easier for my little one on a hot day.She has no troubles moving her head around as stated as a problem in someone else's review.You do need something like this so that it distributes babies weight to your hips when baby gets heavier.Definitely recommend for babies...just remember that baby's legs must be able to wrap around your waist in order to use this or you will need the infant attachment (would not recommend the infant attachment, just get another carrier until baby is bigger).Join Amazon Mom: http://www.amazon.com/gp/mom/signup/welcomeEveryone had raved about Ergo carriers, so we decided to give it a try.Upon receiving it, I noted that the instruction manual recommends that you only use it as a front carrier up to 6 months old.Turns out that's for a really good reason.Our 19 pound baby was WAY to heavy for me to front carry in this carrier.We were both uncomfortable.So, I tried adjusting for a hip carry.It's a horrible hip carrier.They dug into my neck, and put all the weight there.I wasn't interested in carrying a baby so young on my back, so I had to return it.As a side note - I had picked the Performance carrier because I wanted to carry him during the summer, and it's quite hot here.The material is really thick, and the lining is black.There's also no lining between you and the baby, so I knew we'd be sweating all over each other (just like with another carrier we'd tried).very attractive, kids love to drink from it.easy to cleanThere are several buying choices for various vendors, but I purchased mine directly from Amazon even though it was a couple of extra dollars.The 2011 version of the stroller has a PE board inserted in the seat back, which corrects this problem.The seat back is now firm and doesn't sink in.Personally, I am not impressed with this new feature.The best thing is the easy fold.It is simple to do with one hand, while holding your child in the other arm.Basically, you grab a fabric handle on the seat and give it a slight tug.The stroller collapses very easily, and with no hassle.There are some good videos on YouTube that show the folding process.The folding mechanism is something you need to see to fully appreciate.I previously had a Maclaren Quest stroller, which had a much more complicated fold that I needed both hands to do.The unfold is almost as easy.I can hold my child in one arm, and pull the stroller out of the back of my SUV and unfold it with the other arm.The sunshade on this stroller is enormous.You can choose to pull it out either 1/3, 2/3, or the full way out.There are also 2 clear viewing windows on the sunshade which enable you to see your child.When not in use, there is a fabric flap that has velcro to hold it in place.The storage basket underneath is a decent size, but because of the structure of the stroller, it is difficult to fit a diaper bag in.You can easily tuck in smaller items like blankets, toys, a jacket, small bags, etc though.Even though the manufacturer does not recommend it, I hang my large diaper bag from the handle.The stroller is VERY stable, and it does not tip backward.It has elastic on top, so things don't easily fall out.You can put jackets or blankets in this pocket, as long as you fold or roll them first.Small toys fit well too.My only complaint with this stroller is that it does not have a drink holder.Baby Jogger sells a parent console for the handle, but it is rather pricey.I purchased aSunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddyfor less than $10 here on Amazon, which solves that problem for a nominal cost.Baby Jogger sells accessories for the stroller such as a child snack tray, or a bumper bar.There is also a car seat adapter available for purchase.Update:  We have had this stroller for about 3 months now, and I like it better than ever.My daughter was able to easily nap with the almost flat recline.It definitely is not a good stroller to try to push on a sandy beach, but I wasn't expecting it to be.My baby likes to sit up and hold onto the belly bar.This added dramatically to the width of the strollers side by side.We could not fit through a standard doorway.Also, with a real side by side double stroller you have 2 wheels in the middle.When you attach two single strollers, you have 4 wheels in the middle.This made the strollers impossible to roll in harmony with each other.The strollers broke away from each other within minutes.My babies were crying and I had to push one a few feet, then push the other so we could get back to the car and go home to get our real double stroller.If I had one child and thought I needed the best baby monitor available on the market today, I would probably look at this one.My biggest issue is that simply setting it up is not as easy at it could be.As a mom of 3 under 7, I need to be able to get things done fast or not do it at all.So this baby monitor probably has features that would be cool to figure out, like temperature and humidity control, but after looking at the user guide 3 times and constantly being interupted, now 3 weeks later I have have yet to set them up.Pros:1) It's rechargable.Now personally, I think this freaks my young baby out completely, so it might take some getting used to, but my older kids think it's great fun.Setting the temperature in the room seems like a simple one, and I am pretty good at stuff like this, but this particular unit eludes me.Maybe others won't have the same issues given more time.So my thoughts go like this: if you have the time and inclination to sit down and set this monitor up properly, have at it and you will likely be pleased.If you are just looking for a simple monitor that plugs in the wall and you can hear your baby crying when they wake up from a nap, save your money and buy something simple.This monitor is a nice alternative to the other audio-only monitors on the market.The device plays lullabies and has a nightlight function and monitors the room temperature and humidity level.The lullabies have a midi quality (they sound very computer generated).And unfortunately they are not on shuffle so that lullaby repeats over and over and the only way to change the tune is to go in the room and change it on the base device.The volume of the music is controllable though so you can have a nice soft sound or a little louder if you want music playing in the background during playtime.There is also a 2-way radio function with this monitor.The company suggests the two-way feature be used to soothe a crying baby, but my baby is only 4 months and requires my presence not just my voice to be soothed.I probably wouldn't buy this monitor myself because I much prefer to have a video so that I can see my baby not just hear him.The temperature feature is not necessary either -- all it does is tell you the temperature in the room and is supposed to alarm if the temperature goes higher or lower than you would like.My house has well regulated temperature so I am not concerned about a lot of variation in temperature in the baby's room.That being said, the monitor sound is clear, and when using the 2-way feature, the quality of the audio is good.I rated this 3.5/5 stars because even a good audio monitor can't replace the benefit of a video.And because the lullabies are not on shuffle and you can't turn the lullaby off or change the song from the hand-held device.I do not have a baby, but did have a sick mother who needed to be monitored 24 hours a day during her final days battling cancer.Previously I had tried a couple fairly cheap baby monitors, but always had the same problem with sound cutting on at random times.The receiver that I kept with me would play lots of static or suddenly cut on at random times, and when I would check on my mother, she would be sound asleep.I noticed this same level of sensitivity with three baby monitors I tried and had been given by friends.I was going to get a video monitor, but ended up switching over to the Philips Avent monitor.The first thing I noticed was that I didn't have the same problems with overly-sensitive audio.My mother did not make a lot of noise, but when she did make enough, the receiver would cut on and I could check on her.It was not a blaringly loud sound when it cut on either.Another nice feature was that I could mute the receiver and just watch the visible lighted alert on it.Some of the other features, such as the lullabies and humidity/temp monitors I did not use as much, but I did try out the lullabies a few times and it seemed like a nice feature, if a little too simple.It would be nice to be able to store my own songs on the machine through MP3 (it can't be too difficult to add a small mp3 player and flash drive).The temp and humidity settings in my house did not fluctuate enough to really have this feature be of much use, but maybe in houses that aren't as insulated as well I could kind of see it being useful.Either way, I think the real strong point of this monitor is how well it handles audio.My wife and I love this monitor.We have replaced aSummer Infant Day & Night Baby Video Monitor with 5" Screen - Whitewith Philips Avent.The parent unit can be set to turn the screen off automatically to save battery unless the baby starts making sounds.Philips manual tells you not to use rechargeable batteries because the baby unit does not have a charging function, but I do not see why one could not use low self-discharge AAAs like Eneloops.This baby monitor is covered by Philips's Full 2-year Warranty, which I found pleasantly surprising because a couple of the Philips DVD players I own have only 90 days warranty and I expected the warranty on the Avent monitor to be no longer than a year.I noticed just two minor issues that may not even be a problem for others.1.For my setup, positioning the camera was a little difficult.We like to see the whole crib from above, so the camera needed to be setup on the shelf above and to the left of the crib.The way the Philips camera and stand are designed, I had to put a wedge under the back of the camera stand so that the camera points where I need it to point.I could not simply rotate the camera down far enough because then the lens would be covered by the stand (see pictures).I did not have this problem with the Summer's camera design.2.They are low intensity, but still visible and distracting.The Summer baby monitor also had night vision, but the night vision LEDs did not emit any visible spectrum light.While reading reviews for other baby monitors, I noticed low ratings because of interference.The performance of the monitor will depend on how "polluted" the frequency band on which it operates at your location.The point is that you won't know unless you try.If you are looking for a baby monitor, I recommend that you consider Philips Avent Baby Monitor.What they fail to tell you with this monitor, is that it only outputs noise in the parents handheld when it "detects" a noise, rather than constantly streaming through everything heard.But, I definitely want to hear it all.The reason for a monitor is the sense of comfort it gives you, in hearing what's happening in your child's room.So, while it may pick up your child yelling out for you, you would have no idea if someone entered their room or if they quietly got out of bed.This was not at all what I was hoping for.Philips Avent's new digital video monitor is a sleek and stylish comfort to new parents.You can even sooth your baby with soft instrumental lullabies by REMOTE CONTROL!And our mobility was restricted slightly because of it.But I plan on tinkering some more before I change my positive verdict.The extra features on this monitor include the ability to play lullabies and the nightlight.Another nice feature is that on the hand-held device, the video picture stays visible unless you turn it off (other monitors only display a picture if you push a button to view and then they quickly turn off).A couple of drawbacks to this monitor system: the lullabies are not on shuffle so it plays the same lullaby over and over until you turn it off or change it yourself.In addition, there is no volume control -- there is one volume only and I found it to be rather loud.Additionally, The camera has to be set on a flat surface as there is no ability to mount it on the wall over the crib.This was an issue for me because I can't see into the crib unless the camera is mounted high and I don't want to put shelves above the crib.Putting the camera into the crib doesn't seem like a very good idea especially as the baby grows and starts to explore his environment.The nightlight feature is definitely very dim.It's enough light so that you can make out objects in a dark room, but not bright enough to change a diaper by.I would give this monitor 4/5 stars for its nice design, good video quality, and lullaby feature.The reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the lack of volume control, the inability to mount the camera, and the fact that the hand-held has a short battery life of only 4 hours.-Used in toddler (2y/o) room.-The video quality is great in bright daylight or at about 4ft during night view.It only cuts on and lets you hear once it's too late and even still only intermittently.My daughters loud crying woke me up long before the monitor decided to let me hear it.-The unit is not expandable, so even if you like it strictly for video, it's the only one you can ever use.-Now that I've bought other units, this one is really nothing special, and HUGELY overpriced.I feel took.When my baby cries, I hear him, so I was mostly interested in the visual capabilities of this monitor.I have to say that the video quality of this product is really great, and I was able to see my baby while he was sleeping perfectly.Since other reviewers have complained about the audio of this monitor, I'll add that, although I don't use the audio function regularly, I did try it out a time or two.My opinion is that it was fine when it worked, but that was only about half the time.In short, if you are looking for a monitor with good audio, you probably should look somewhere else.But if you just want a great display, this could be the monitor for you.My 3-year-old grandson comes to play and I am not very good at getting him down for a nap.I do want to do as my daughter requests, so I try.He tried to tell me he had taken a nap, but I wasn't convinced.We were going to my son's house and hadn't been in the car very long when he passed out.Obviously, he hadn't slept at all.Enter the Phillips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor.The parental unit needs 4 hours to charge, so be sure to allow for that.It also needs to discharge and recharge completely 4 times before it will hold its maximum charge.I put the unit in the room in as discrete a location as I could.They suggest putting the batteries in even if you plug it in so it will still work if there is a power failure.Nap time came and I was able to watch him with the door closed, which he requested.It takes him about 20 minutes to actually fall asleep.That's good to know.My daughter arrived before he woke up.Her monitor is sound only.She has wanted to see what they are doing as well.There are two things I might want.One is a bigger screen.I had to use my reading glasses to see what he was doing.If I were a parent and not a grandparent, that probably wouldn't be a problem.I think it would also be nice to have an intercom, especially with the older kids.We didn't have any kind of monitor when my kids were babies.We got excited when they first came out with cordless telephones, and the reception wasn't very good back then.I know, I'm dating myself.Right out of the box, this product was easy to set up and understand, and so far, it works perfectly.The range for the handheld video device is excellent and there isn't any interference from any other devices in the house, such as the wi-fi network or other electronics.The clarity of the images on the handheld monitor are first-rate.There are no blurry or fuzzy video connections.The handheld monitor has a belt clip which can easily be turned upside down so you can stand the device up on a counter or table without having to hold it, so you could be in the kitchen, cooking and taking care of things while being able to constantly look over and both see and hear your baby on the monitor screen.There are other potential uses for the Philips Advent Digital Video Baby Monitor, although not endorsed or suggested by the manufacturer.Tested out as a security system, with the camera mounted on a windowsill, provided a surprisingly clear constant view of the front door and porch.I recommend this product.My wife and I already own aPhilips Avent Basic Baby Monitor w/ DECT Technology, but wanted to try this product out too and I was able to do a direct comparison.We did not originally get a video monitor as we felt uncomfortable with the Big Brother factor of watching our baby via video.However, we have grown to like it and it saves us unnecessary trips to the nursery to see if our baby is babbling and playing safely or is in need or help.Here's what we like and dislike about this digital video monitor after a couple months of use:POSITIVES:1.We had no problems with reception on either monitor even when it was close to our iPhones, computer, WiFi routers, and so forth.2.No cross-talk between DECT monitors: Even side-by side and set up in the same room, the two Phillips AVENT monitors caused no interference with each other.There is no cross-talk with the neighbor's baby monitor either.3.Good range: I've walked about 50 feet from baby's room with the video monitor, and the signal is still good through several walls.Decent battery life: On standby mode, the rechargeable battery lasts at least 5-6 hours.I have achieved about 3 hours of battery life with the monitor continuously on.However, in both cases I haven't tested the full battery life of the unit and the performance may be even better.5.You don't have to be a rocket scientist.6.No 2-way communication: My wife and I like the 2-way communication feature on thePhilips Avent Basic Baby Monitor w/ DECT Technology, but this AVENT Video monitor has no such 2-way feature.It is a handy feature for my wife and I to alert each other from baby's room rather than yelling through the house.2.It's too big to fit in a pocket, and too awkward to hang from a belt loop.Don't plan on carrying this around the house too much.I was skeptical of the need for a video baby monitor right up until it came time to move my baby into the crib in his own room...and then mommy paranoia kicked in.I researched a few monitors and the other one I was looking at had a few too many reviews mentioning that the screen froze so we went with this one.We've been using it for 3 weeks now and absolutely love it.It's well made, works great, and has not had any interference problems in our house.Does it have drawbacks...yes.Not being able to mount it on a wall and not being able to tilt it down in the base past about 20 degrees (the microphone gets blocked) being the two major issues I have.**EDIT**We have had the monitor for over 8 months now and still love it.After reading some of the other reviews we bought a tripod to mount it and it works great.Thinking down the line to our next kid it would be nice to have a system that works with two cameras, but at some point having a camera in your kid's room has got to get creepy and I'm sure we'll be ready to move it out in time to not need two.I hope.**UPDATE**After having the monitor for ~2 years the battery would not a hold a charge very long.Which is annoying but would be survivable if Phillips sold replacement batteries, which they do not.**2nd Update**My youngest is now 33 months and I have a 7 week old.With the newborn I needed a 2nd monitor and was reluctant to buy the Motorola or Samsung monitors (even with the cool pan/tilt/zoom) since I really like some of the basic features of this monitor.I have come to be extremely unhappy with that decision.And biggest disappointment of them all, the two units interfere with each other.Just for comparison, the Baby Monitor which I received (and am reviewing) is actually not the one pictured.It also has a nightlight, which helps during the night, since it means not having to turn on the light to check on baby.There are two things I particularly appreciate about this monitor.1) It uses a DECT signal, which does not interfere with my internet router or other electronics.It also means a stronger signal, and I had no difficulty in connecting through cinderblock walls from our basement to the opposite corner of our home, or from outside the house.2) I love having the "talk" feature from the handset.So, not only can I hear, and monitor the room temperature and the humidity, I can "talk back."I'm not sure if I was shipped the wrong item, but the monitor I received was not the one that is pictured.I had the SCD520 and liked it, but found the temperature to always be way off.Being able to monitor temperature and humidity is helpful too because we live in a high humidity area and, in the summer, that can make a big difference as to how comfortable the baby's room is.I never thought I'd use the two way talking functionality, but I am surprised at how much I do!I can hear what is going on upstairs when he and his sister are playing and am regularly talking to them saying things like, "Is someone jumping on the bed?"I'm not so sure it would really soothe a baby, but it is handy as they get older.The parent unit sits on a rechargable base like a cordless phone.We have had numerous baby monitors in the past and my biggest issue was that they constantly had dead batteries when I would unplug the unit and want to take it with me somewhere.With this monitor, the unit is always fully charged.I haven't had an issue with any feedback, hearing other people talking on the monitor like I did with other ones, or not being able to hear what was going on in the baby's room.The reception is crystal clear.So, aside from the issue with the pictured item being wrong (which is an Amazon issue, not an Avent issue), I have no complaints about the product at all and would highly recommend it.When I got this baby monitor I was impressed with its quality!I have three, going on four, kids and we've used a variety of monitors from various manufacturers and this one impressed me the most.The audio quality is great, DECT makes things interference and feedback free, there's a handy "page" feature for if you misplaced the receiver, and there's no hassle getting the anything paired or on the right channel like cheaper monitors.I also liked the ability for two-way communication, which the manufacturer claims is good to "sooth your baby".I personally don't trust that claim (cranky babies liked to be held, not talked to), but it is EXCELLENT if you want to keep an ear out for troublesome toddlers who are supposed to be going to bed!You might be surprised to discover how quickly they dart under the covers once a booming voice lets them know they've been discovered playing around!As far as the quality goes, everything about this monitor seems well thought out from the ergonomics of the charging dock to the ease of instrumentation, impressive range and intelligent power throttling features (better battery life).You get your hands on this monitor and it just feels slick and careful in design.It's smaller than it looks in the picture (considerably smaller than other monitors I use) which is great!However, it also comes with a belt clip and lanyard if you prefer.The monitor, despite its power, is tiny too: squarish and smaller than my fist.It would easily tuck into a corner of a dresser without taking up much space.The only thing I would have liked to see is a video camera which other monitors of similar price points come with.That said, I think this monitor is well worth the price, and it's certainly the best designed monitor I've used.I guess the only difference between a baby monitor and a room monitor is the Lullaby feature - if you ignore that, this could be used for much more.Baby monitor, room monitor, keep an ear on the teens party monitor, plant area monitor and more.What's in the box:Receiver (about the size of a large pager)Transmitter (aka monitor) (about the size of a coffee mug)Padded carrying bagTwo AC transformersLeash for receiverInstructionsIt's pretty much plug in and go.Then it's done.The transmitter has this little thingie sticking out the back I initially thought was an antenna.Nope - it's a sensor.Both pieces display the room temp and humidity.This makes it that much easier.If you're running a humidifier during the winter, you can look at the receiver and check the humidity status.Eventually you'll use this for something else than baby monitoring.There are a lot of possibilities, especially since the temp and humidity are also monitored.Automatic alert: The pager starts beeping if the monitor detects persistent loud noise (crying, shouting, etc.)There's also a visual display made up of five blinking LED's that indicated the level of noise in the room.Two-way communication: The receiver can also transmit back to the base unit.Range: 1,000 feet - pretty impressive.Interference: When the receiver gets too close to some electronics with speakers I noticed interference - similar to what you hear with some cell phones.My main computer sound system is susceptible to this interference - my Droid X drives them crazy.Same for the Avent receiver - it has to be at least five feet away from the sound system.My other two computers?It drops into a base that charges the unit.The two power supplies have different connectors so you can't put them in the wrong device.I live in an apartment building with many other tenants.Each apartment in my complex has at least one set of cordless phones and a wireless network.I tried many digital monitors in my apartment but it seems the only ones that would work are way over my price range.I plan to use this monitor for many years to come.UPDATE (3/29/12)I've had this more than a year and it still works as well as the day I got it.I'm very impressed by the durability and when I'm using the backup batteries in the infant unit, it actually doesn't eat through them too quickly.The battery on the parent unit lasts me about 24 hours before it needs a recharge.When I first discovered that this unit had temp/humidity alarms, I was temped to monitor my basement where I brew beer, but I then remembered why I ordered this unit.Worry not, I didn't put the baby in the basement with the beer to accomplish both aims, but the thought may have crossed my mind.The problem is that this unit does such a great job at monitoring sounds and sending them magically over with a clear crisp sound, so it would be a waste to just use the temp/humidity ability.So few monitors get this basic ability to send clear sound all wrong, so kudos to Philips for doing it right.The lullabies and light on the base is another plus, and before you know it, you're wondering why you looked at anything else.$100 is a lot, but it's a small price to pay for peace of mind.This is a great baby carrier.I wanted to replace the Baby Bjorn carrier that I've been using because my son was starting to outgrow it and it was really starting to hurt my upper back.I wanted something that was easy to use, like the Baby Bjorn.Here are the things I like about this carrier:-Easy to use--it doesn't take long to figure out how to strap the carrier on.Now that I know what I'm doing, I can get him in and out within seconds.-Very easy to get the baby in and out of the carrier--much easier that the old carrier I was using.-The fabric is soft and well padded-Multiple positions for carrying baby (front, side, and back)-It doesn't hurt my back!-Not bulky like some other carriers I had researched.*My son is 8 months old so I can't comment on how well it works for newborns.You can't tell from the picture of the carrier.The waist strap is the one that bothers me the most.I just tuck it in after I get my baby secured.This is a really good product, super easy to install (I outfitted our entire house in less than 1/2 hr).Opening the box, the first thing you will notice is the quality of the carrier.The material feels very durable and the stitching is very impressive.The color that was selected was `earth'.It is lint prone so please keep that in mind if selecting this color.I do not have another brand carrier to compare it to since this is the first carrier I have used for my daughter.The first time you use the carrier you will have to adjust it to your body/frame.Please be very careful when doing so if you have not adjusted the arms and neck area for your own fit.I was really impressed with how the carrier offers so much adjustability.It is not just for one size person.The torso area is long enough but yet you are able to adjust it for a shorter torso without the material bunching up.I love that the carrier is made with a lot of padding but is not bulky.The carrier offers a hood that they call a `sleeping hood'.The carrier also offers foot straps.I have not used them yet but can see an advantage to them.My daughter's feets usually just lay to the side of the carrier.The straps are also removable which is handy.When she gets older I will use it for the back but right now she likes to feel secure and close to my chest so I use it solely for front use.She also falls asleep in the carrier or likes to look around.I think it provides a baby/child the security they are used with being close to the parent.I was more than impressed not only with the quality of the carrier but the comfort it provides.My daughter loves being in it while I am in the house doing things where I need my hands.I also use it in stores since I have a convertible car seat and am not able to take the car seat out but use the carrier in its place.I feel a lot safer having the baby next to my chest as opposed to being in the car seat in the shopping cart.I love this carrier.Definitely a winner with mother and child.I have been "wearing" my kiddos since my oldest son (now 3 1/2) was born, and I was sure I'd LOVE the Boba, which looks very similar to my beloved Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining, only prettier, with softer material.(The heavy, slightly stiff fabric of the Ergo and boring color choices were my only complaint about it.)The Boba certainly looked promising, though the footrests seemed a little unnecessary (I took those off right away).Unfortunately, my youngest, now almost 2, showed himself unwilling to be toted around, so I had to wait for a chance to wear my 8-month-old goddaughter.At 24 pounds, I figured she'd be a true test of the carrier's mettle!(It's rated for children from 15 to 45 pounds.)Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed as soon as I got her into the carrier.However, I simply could NOT get the chest strap low enough to actually go across my chest; instead, it rode up in the vicinity of my neck, which was extremely uncomfortable, both in that it didn't distribute the baby's weight across my chest, and of course in that I had a strap practically rubbing across my throat.)In addition, the super-soft fabric just didn't offer the support of the Ergo.She is very used to being worn (though generally by her parents, not me), so it's hard to say whether she was uncomfortable with the carrier or the lady-who's-not-Mom carrying her.I'm disappointed to say that I probably can't recommend the Boba, unless you're primarily using it for younger/smaller babies (15-20 pounds or so) and in a front carry.Any bigger, and I would have to recommend the Ergo instead.This is a pretty comfortable baby carrier, but please note that it is not designed for babies without head control.This means your baby will need to be about 3-4 months old before using this carrier.So, if you're looking for something for a newborn, you want to use a different carrier.Pros:* It comes with two additional features not always found on baby carriers: a sleeping/feeding hood and foot straps.These are nice little add-ons, although the hood is not likely to be used after baby is about 9 months, unless your baby just *likes* to have things on its head.The foot straps are detachable, so you can choose whether you want to use them or not.* I am relatively new to the motherhood thing, but I couldn't figure out how to place the kid behind me without having a second person to help.For use with younger, smaller children this is a definite plus, but I found that carrying my three-year-old in here is hard on my shoulders and back.While the product descriptions say it holds up to 45lbs (my daughter is ten pounds shy of that), I would not recommend using this with a toddler.That said, I didn't select this to use with her (it just seemed like an added bonus).Even my three-year-old said she was comfortable while her daddy was writhing in pain.So, if you are planning on using this with a baby, go for it.Just don't buy this solely for use with a toddler.Hiking in the woods, picking pumpkins and apples or just going to the playground is made much easier when carrying a baby in this.Carrying the older ones on the back work better since they are able to look around and seem to have a lot more fun!High quality and ultra safe design!The price is great and the foot straps are a big plus to have.The Boba classic baby carrier has quickly jumped to the top of my list of baby carriers.If there is a baby carrier out there, I've probably not only tried it, but own it.My favorite to date has been the Ergo, but this comes in a strong second, if not exactly next to the Ergo.Before I reviewed this carrier I wore it:--12 hours for 3 days touring Chicago [no pain!]--Grocery shopping--Cleaning/Cooking--Walking/Parks--Around the house--Carried a 6 month old [who could spread it's legs] & 3 year oldHere's why I love the Boba:Pros:1.I like that the strap connects behind your neck [easier to adjust than between your shoulders like the Ergo3.Adjusts to larger waists & hips than the Ergo [this is necessary now that I've carried 3 babies]4.Can wear & put on easily on front & back5.Learning curve for putting on and adjusting is similar to that of other carriers [need a few trys]6.Hood is great8.Comes in cute colors10.Baby & Toddler adore it11.Liked the little loops on front, could hook other things to it like keys & toddler harnessCon:1.Didn't really need the foot straps, but they were cuteUnlike some of the reviewers, I don't have a lot of experience with the many types of baby carriers.My cousin Alyssa is a year old, and this carrier is perfect for her.She's a chunky little thing, and the carrier works great for her.I do agree with other reviewers in thinking that this carrier will not work on child up to 45 pounds.This carrier is pretty much like a book sack, and that's what it feels like.A squirmy baby book sack.This is a fantastic baby carrier.The only thing you have to do is adjust the straps, clip and you're set.There are no complicatied instructions.Therer is also a roll up hood in case of a sprinkle or wind, and its open on the sides so baby can still see out either side.I use this carrier all the time and it has given me so many more options for getting around.I find it easily stores slung over a hanger in the closet.Enter second daughter and I use it all of the time.She is now 11 months old and about 18 pounds and I still use it while running errands to keep her contained.I was excited to try to Boba because I had heard great things about it however I am a little disappointed.My biggest disappointment is that you cannot carry a child on your front, facing forwards.Not only is it very hard to get a child in and out on your own while wearing them on your back, they sit so low in the carrier that once again my daughter could only see my back and did not have the freedom to look around much.I even tried using the Boba to carry my older daughter, who is almost 3 and about 35 pounds, on my back.We used it while hiking and while it was very comfortable for me, she did not love the ride.The shoulder straps and the waist strap definitely provide more support and a more comfortable ride for the carrier than a Baby Bjorn - I just wish it was a better for my little riders!My wife has tried just about every baby carrier out there.Some she really likes (Moby Wrap) some she does not (Baby Bjorn).The fabric is a lot nicer than a lot of carriers out there, and the straps are better positioned.It's pretty easy to put on.I'm notoriously bad with baby carriers and I had no trouble with this one.Kids really settle into it.A small baby with no head control wouldn't like it because theres not enough support (for that my wife sticks with her Moby wrap).It's a little pricey, but the quality is pretty high, and it's a lot more "Dad friendly" than a lot of carriers.Having a young child, we've tried many baby carriers that are available on the market.Unfortunately our child doesn't enjoy carriers as much as other kids, so it hasn't been used as much as we hoped it would be.This carrier has defined straps, padding, foot rests, etc.Comes with a 'hood' that can be used to protect the child's head from sun/elements, and also has little foot straps in order to keep your childs feet from dangling.Ease of use.If both parents are using it, it might be annoying going back and forth.Quality.I think this is where the boba shines.The fabric that is used seems very durable, yet has a soft, almost microfiber feel to it.It also looks nice, and seems like it will continue looking nice throughout whatever your child decides to throw at it.This review was written by my wife:I haven't had the chance to try out many different soft carriers.The only I had used before this was the Baby Bjorn.The Baby Bjorn and the Boba are definitely 2 completely different carriers.I used the Baby Bjorn with my big boy until he was about 1 and then he got too heavy for me to carry.I'm short and couldn't see over her head.The only problem I have with the back carry is the chest strap is very high and can become uncomfortable.There are many different body types though, so it may work well for some and not for others.I have a one year old who weighs about 19 lbs.We also have a Kelty 2.0 backpack carrier which is great for travel, but big - and bulky for around the house or for quick outings.The Boba carrier is GREAT!You hook the waist belt on you and then hold the baby, then pull up the shoulder straps (like a reverse backpack) for a forward carry (facing in only) and connect the chest straps - then tighten the waist straps.Be sure to tighten the waist belt because if it's loose, the baby could fall through that gap.I needed help getting my daughter in, but if you are a super-Mommy you can probably figure out a way to do it without help.I could get her OUT of the back carry on my own by sitting in a chair.My daughter prefers the front carry (at least for now).I had originally looked at the Ergo but went with the Baby Bjorn when my daughter was a newborn.As other reviews have said, the Boba is for babies 15 lbs.One advantage over the Ergo for me is that the boba MUCH longer waist strap - it goes to 56" rather than 43".(Note:  Ergo does sell an 8" expander belt that takes it to 51" but boba still wins here).If you are interested in a HIP carry feature, the boba does not have it, while the Ergo does.I have an inexpensive Playtex hip carrier so this was not an issue for me.The shoulder straps are padded and I feel like my daughter is very secure in the carrier.She was sick last week and wanted to be carried much more than normal.I was able to put her in the carrier and still get exciting things done like the dishes.The fold up sleeping / rain hood stays out of the way when not needed but is a great feature to have.Because the carrier hits my daughter around her neck, if she does fall asleep in it, I can keep her head from bobbing around.You pretty much take it out of the box and can figure it out.It would be easy for relatives or caregivers to use without a very long introduction.I do agree it would be nice if it had a small pouch for keys, cell phone, etc.but it's not a dealbreaker.I need to carry much more with me (baby sherpa) on a regular basis than keys and a cell phone.The carrier seems to be very secure with huge (they say, military grade) waist buckle.The little stirrups for baby's feet seem to be nice addition, I never seen this feature before, and It looks like they position baby quite comfortably in this area.My baby is 11 months and he weighs 24 pounds, and I think the carrier is a little short for him, he tended to keep his arms over the shoulder straps, and the top edge of the carrier is about at his shoulder height, so there is no place for him to rest his head, and to sleep comfortably, as it seems to be possible with some other carriers.On the other hand, with baby this big and heavy, it is quite unlikely I will ever use the carrier for such prolonged time that he will have the time to sleep.The manual says something about breastfeeding the baby while carrying him.I didn't try to nurse the baby inside the carrier because I really didn't understand how to do it, he seems to sit way high for that to happen.This is a nicely made baby carrier.This Boba carrier comes in a variety of colors so that you can choose what is best for you.And Granola.(100% cotton).I got the green one.Not designed for newborns, they'll want a little head support for this.Weight 15-45 lbs, but stick with smaller children.It's a front pack or backpack (no head support on the back, so be sure baby can do it).A lot of carriers like this one come with infant inserts.This unfortunately does not, and when I asked if I could use another brands insert they said no.That being said, I never actually tried it so it could work just fine.The carrier is high quality, soft fabric, and really comfortable to wear.The product is really easy to use and my baby loved being in the carrier.This carrier grows with the baby and will get a lot of use!The colors are attractive and the carrier looks very stylish when worn.It even looks good when Dad is using it!Overall I think this is a great carrier, I just wish there was an infant insert to use.I'll preface this by saying I see many of the reviewers say it's very similar to the Ergo Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining which is a very popular and beloved carrier, however not one that I own.My beloved carrier is a Beco ButterflyBeco Butterfly II Baby Carrier with Brown Base, Carnivaland I was looking at this carrier to be a backup to that one (why would one need two carriers you might ask, easy... mine is always somewhere else when I need it... either I've forgotten it at home when we are walking at the beach or it's in the car when I need to carry my daughter around while cleaning the house or making dinner so having 2 so I can keep one in the van and another in the house is ideal).Immediately I noticed that it's very well constructed, solid seams and a very well padded pouch for your child and very well padded straps for you.I was really excited to try it out with my almost 22lbs 29" 6 1/2 month old daughter as carrying her around in my arms is exhausting (the main reason I love my Beco, it's sooo easy to carry her around even for extended periods and is very comfortable to wear).I looked over the directions and then attempted to put on the carrier, long story short it was just plain hard to do, so hard infact that I had to have my 6 1/2yr old daughter adjust the straps for me (or at least hand them to me so I could pull them tight) once I had my baby inside.I simply could not reach to do it myself.I'm 5'7" and have a pretty large chest so maybe that compounded with my babies large size was the issue, honestly I'm not sure.Once I had her positioned and everything tightened correctly she was very content but I was miserable.The thickly padded straps were cumbersome, I didn't have good arm movement, and I just wanted it OFF asap.The Beco also comes with an infant insert so you can use it immediately, this isn't an option with the Boba and is an accessory you must buy with the Ergo.While initially I thought the foot straps were a great idea I realized that they aren't necessary and might actually prove an issue since your child/baby might try to use them to push up making them unstable and driving you nuts ;)I'll update my review once I've had the chance to try it in the back carry position.This is likely a great carrier for the right build of parent but for me, I'll stick with my Beco.I must disclose that my baby isn't out of the womb yet.Stylish colors, soft but heavy weight cotton fabric.Putting it on was very easy - nothing to confusing to figure out but it does come with picture directions just in case you needed them, both for a front wear and a back wear.I have used carriers before that had criss-crossing straps that were not only confusing but a hassle and a pain to get on and off and sized.Even a little bit overweight people.I am very pregnant and it can fit me around my waist.Currently my waist is at 42 inches and I still could be bigger and have this fit.I like that this is machine washable.You know how spitty uppy and drooly babies and toddlers can be.I can't see myself using the rain hood, but who knows.But they don't bother me being there but they are removable too, which is a nice option to have and I appreciate they thought of that.I will give a better update later on after baby has arrived and reached the 15-45 pounds that the carrier is designed to hold.It's never going to feel fantastic carrying around a child who weighs 35 pounds and up, no matter what carrier you choose.Once my daughter got a little heavier, though, we needed to move on to other types of carriers, and soon found that soft structured carriers (SSCs) were best for us.I'm a petite mom with a big daughter!She's 3 1/2 years old now and very tall, and about 36 pounds.We don't do much babywearing anymore, but I still find it handy in certain situations-- like quick store trips or walks around the block.It looks pretty darn awkward now, though, considering she's so big and I'm so short, so I've been trying to get used to back carries.I couldn't do it with my Freehand mei tai or with my APLX, but for the first time, I was able to do a (short) back carry with this Boba without much discomfort.I think the main difference is in the amount of padding in the straps (a LOT!).This is a very well-made carrier with lots of support in the waist and shoulders.I come close to needing a smaller belt, though-- I have to tighten it almost all the way to make it snug, and I'm not very skinny-- about 125 pounds.So I'd just caution that if you're really thin, this might not be tight enough.The only other down-side I can see is the storage for the sleeping hood and foot straps.Although they're both fully removable, there's nowhere to put them.My APLX has a great inner pocket big enough to store the sleeping hood flat, so I never lose it-- but the Boba has nothing.Once you get past babyhood, you won't use the sleeping hood again, and the toddler foot straps are useless once your child gets too tall to fit into them (I can't comment on their usefulness before that point).So you'll need to store them somewhere that you'll remember or they'll be lost forever if you plan to use the carrier with another child (or give it away, sell it, etc.).All in all, this is a great pick, and a carrier that seems built to last.Baby sits snuggly close to mommy.Very nice product.As a back carrier, some contortionist skills are needed (or a second person), especially if your child likes to squirm.The risk of the child falling while putting him in as a back carrier seems very high.Once in the carrier, both front and back use, the child seems very secure.The material is soft and seems easily washable.Baby seemed comfortable.The carrier was not very comfortable for me, especially in the shoulders.I seemed to run out of shoulder strap cushioning as the straps went over my shoulders.I tried to wear the entire carrier higher up, but then I couldn't see because my son's face was right in front of mine.The foot straps are a nice idea, but my son didn't want to use them.Although rated up to 45 pounds, I think this would be a fine carrier for smaller children.For older/larger toddlers, I recommend a metal frame carrier.I like the look and overall style and versatility of this carrier.The carrier is intended to hold toddlers between 15 and 45 pounds and can be used to carry your child on your back or up front.I took issue with the fact that while it's machine washable, the manufacturer recommends spot cleaning.The recommendation to machine wash only when necessary makes me wonder if this carrier can handle multiple runs through a washer.Using this carrier is pretty easy but not as easy as using a Baby Bjorn front carrier.To carry your child up front you need to load your baby into the carrier and then reach around back and clip the strap that secures the shoulder straps in place.I found using the carrier as a backpack carrier to be slightly easier.I think any user with a lumbar back problem will want to avoid using this carrier as a front carrier.The carrier secures around your waist and much of the weight is distributed to your lower back as a result.Using it as a backpack carrier was less strain on my back.I will never use another carrier again.The idea of "you get what you pay for" is so true with this product - it's pricey, but it is worth every penny to get a quality carrier.This Boba carrier is designed to hold children from 15lbs to 45 lbs; my daughter is just shy of 15lbs and my son is 33lbs and I have used it with both of them.It takes well over an hour of carrying my infant daughter before my back even BEGINS to hurt, which is phenomenal in my experience.Of course, i'm also overweight and in horrible shape, so if you are someone who actually takes care of themselves, this carrier might NEVER cause you to hurt!I must say that it's nearly impossible to carry my son in this carrier... and pretty much any carrier.I honestly don't see how it's possible to carry such a large, heavy child in ANY contraption.It's just plain not good for your body.When my child is secured in it i never feel like she's going to fall out or shift around.One of the best features of this carrier is the roll-up cover for baby - it's RIGHT there, you don't have to search for it, it unrolls quickly and easily - and it's just as easily put away!Genius!Overall, this is the best carrier i've ever used and I highly recommend it!Everything is adjustable and literally everyone from myself to my in-laws to my wife's brother has put this thing on adjusted in in less than 2min and been carrying the kid around.It's quick, easy and I don't feel that my child could slip out or that the carrier could fail in any way that would endanger the child.There is also a cover for the baby's head that will keep the head bobbing to a minimum when they fall asleep on you, which happens often in this carrier (and is a good sign that it's comfortable for the kid!)A few pockets or loops would be nice because it does pretty much remove your ability to access your pants pockets when you are wearing it and there isn't a good place to put a diaper or cell phone or water bottle for those quick runs to the post office or grocery store when a diaper bag just defeats the purpose of a quick run in trip.Reading the other reviews this carrier really serves to reinforce that carriers are about as individual as the babies that go in them.That said this is a carrier I think most will like.Bottom line: if there's one carrier out there that fits all needs, positions, and sizes of babies and toddlers, I haven't seen it.Which means you need to pick a good that fits what you need.If you want to wear a 15+ lb baby or a toddler facing your chest, then I'd see no reason not to recommend this one.I've really enjoyed using mine.Unlike some others, I haven't tried a bunch of different carriers.Eventually I will feel a little pull on my back, but it mostly feels like I'm carrying him up against my chest - except I still have the use of my hands and my arms don't get tired!I've used it on fairly short hikes, short trips into stores that don't have carts, and for the times when we arrive somewhere and I find he's fallen asleep.He can often sleep a little longer if I transfer from carseat to Boba, which tells me it's probably about as comfortable as being carried for him as well.The inability to wear him facing forward on my front is the main downside I see to the Boba if you have a little one that wants to see what's going on.He wouldn't be high enough to see much, so I doubt he would really like it.One helpful note - I'm probably the smallest parent I know (4'11", 25-26" waist) and this seems to fit me fine adjusted to the smallest settings.It's perhaps a touch big in the waist, but it's no problem over the clothes I'm typically wearing.I can't comment on how it would fit a big parent, but it seems to have a lot of room for adjustment.We have tried over 25 different carriers, and have lots to say about them.Make sure you find a carrier that is comfortable for you, so you can *enjoy* that bonding time!)I know this will offend some folks, but the studies are overwhelming - children in strollers & car seats all day develop slower because they can't see as much, they don't learn about motion & gravity, they can't touch you when they need to, see your facial expressions, etc.Getting (and using) a quality carrier is good for your baby's health.(2) If you are an active person (or committed to a lot of contact with your baby), no single carrier will meet all your needs.Sorry to say it, but I'll repeat it - if you are committed to carrying your baby for hiking, picnics, shopping, walks, etc., then you will need more than one  carrier.That said, out of all the carriers we tried, the Boba Classic is definitely near the TOP of our list.It has a few things which make it unique:-Hip Belt: The biggest perk.Most other carriers rest on shoulders, which distributes all the weight to your back.This hip belt (pretty high quality, modeled after high end backpacking gear) distributes 50-75% of the weight to your lower body (not neck/back/shoulders).That's IF you wear it properly.Ergo is the other design which does this well (see below).-Adjustable privacy hood (also good for weather & rain)-Stirrups so the child can push herself up, adjust for comfort, etc.-One of the few carriers that you can wear on front or on your back.-The photo doesn't do it justice - it's a classic design, & very well-built.Great construction, nice color, heavy-duty straps.-Not the easiest carrier to load the baby, but has a unique one-snap release-This is one of the few carriers which fits larger people (up to maybe 50" waist)Now some criticisms:-If you're taller than 6 feet, the shoulder straps & hip belt may not work.-Seat/saddle is very wide.Baby must sit like a frog (see pic), and might not be comfortable for long periods of time, depending on your baby's comfort level & preference.-[EDIT] Initially I thought the strap was scratchy on my neck - but that was before I learned it can be adjusted.-Baby cannot face out while wearing on chest-Weight is 15 to 45 lbs, so you'll still need a sling for newborns.Like I said, if you're committed to the idea of a carrier, no single carrier meets all your needs.This one is the best backpack we've found because it's convertible (into front carrier), and great for hiking, backpacking, and active days.Here are a few brief notes about other carriers we've tried:This standard Snugli design is thin, light weight, inexpensive, and a great option when traveling light.... but NOT as comfortable as the Boba.All the ones we tried were very similar architecture though (except for our favorite style, which converts from sling to front carrier, but it was discontinued when Evenflo bought out Snugli).The Maya is one of our favorite sling/carrier/wraps.Just buy a set of Maya rings, and pick out your favorite fabric.We've been using the Maya design since day one.Please note the *safest* and most comfortable for the baby are the Maya wraps *without* padding.Once you are wearing it, you'll see what I mean.And, the Maya is perhaps the most portable of all the slings/wraps.The Moby is similar to Maya,Moby Wrap Baby Carrier, with many of the same advantages, but a little bulkier.It's difficult to wear the baby on the side with a Moby.I still give Moby very high ratings, but we like the Maya better.The side-carriers are nice (baby is off to side, almost under arm).It's padded and comfortable, light weight, somewhat versatile (baby faces in or out), and probably the easiest to load into.Much lighter/thinner/sleeker than the Boba, but does not have some of the amenities.Two snap release (vs. one snap with Boba), and again, it puts all the weight on the back, shoulders, and neck.The Bjorn is adjustable so you can distribute weight to the shoulders, but you're still carrying the baby with upper body.But we're keeping our Bjorn for short trips (like the farmer's market), when there is a lot of in & out of car seats, for short outings when portability is an issue, and when the baby might want to face out.BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier OriginalPlease don't confuse Boba with the "Balboa".If you're a Dr Sears fan (I am not) then you've seen his endorsements of the Balboa.However, this is similar to the design which got recalled in January 2010 (suffocation issues).They made some adjustments so it's probably safer now, but the bottom line is ANY sling-style carrier which "cinches" the sides (with elastic, etc) keeps your baby hidden and risks smothering.I'm sure 99% of people who own this have never had a problem, but I don't like it.And I don't find it comfortable anyway:Balboa Baby Adjustable Sling by Dr. SearsFinally, two carriers with designs very similar to the Boba.I also give it high ratings - but I also find it a bit bulkier, and since there is no need to have two carriers of the same design, I prefer the Boba.Similarly, theInfantino Balance Baby Carrieris almost an exact copy-cat of the Boba, but (typical of Infantino products) they cut every corner possible.Not enough fabric on the hip belt to make it effective.Cheaper material.It says for babies 8 pounds & up, but the seat/saddle was poorly designed and we found it doesn't fit until your baby is about 18-20 pounds.I give the Infantino a thumbs down.I hope this information helps.Elena is just new and she requires me to carry her everywhere!I can't vacuum without her being with me.The Boba allows me to have a free hand so I can get some work done around here.Right now she's a front loader and she is very content.It's easy to load her in and she looks very comfortable in there.As my brother has had extensive experience with various carriers, I provided him with the Baboa Carrier and asked him for his comparative opinion.This review is the result:After three kids, I think I have a pretty solid feel for exactly what makes a body-mounted baby carrier worth its salt.I've used the fabledBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City BlackandErgo Baby Carrier - Camelextensively in the last six years.First, I'll compare it to the original classic, the Baby Bjorn:I love the Bjorn because it is very easy to don if you don't have an extra set of hands to help you get into the thing.This is one area where I wish the designers of both the Ergo and Baboa carrier had put a little more thought.My biggest gripe about the Bjorn, however, is the fact that it is very hard to jam a kid into it if they are over a year old.They will just be falling out of the thing from all sides.The Baboa has ample room to grow into, and if you go with the back-mount, you could probably fit your wife into it if she is not too portly.The Ergo Baby is more accommodating for older/larger kids as well.In putting the Baboa head-to-head with the Ergo, they are actually very similar.Both have a nice little head-covering flap you can snap up over the kids if they fall asleep in it so they don't get sunburn on their tender noggins.The Baboa got two big bonus points though.The placement and function of the adjustment straps were a bit more convenient than the Ergo.Additionally, the Baboa has stirrups for the kids' feet.I am not sure if this is not more of a novelty that a useful feature since the kids could easily "dismount" from the things if they wanted to, but it was a nice touch.If you are trying to decide which will be right for you, you can't beat the Bjorn for little ones (like under 12 months).But when they grow out of that, I think the Baboa edged out the Ergo by a nose just for the ease of adjustment.All-in-all this is a very nice carrier.I love the ease of the straps, and being able to slip it on and off without having to wrap and tie and avoiding the learning curve needed for the wrap/tie type of carriers and slings.This carrier is NOT for newborns - suggested beginning weight is 15 pounds and while it says it can go up to 30 pounds I have to say lugging around a 30 pound toddler in this thing was NOT an easy task, and not something I would do on a regular basis or if I had other options.I think this carrier would be more ideal for up to 20 to maybe 25 pounds.By that point I think a more sturdy metal-frame carrier is a better option for strong/active toddlers.I liked the concept of the foot straps and thought they might make the 'ride' more comfortable for my little one, but she seemed more annoyed with them than anything else and we ended up not using them - at least they are detachable.While a bit on the pricey side, I do like the Boba and would recommend it for infants/toddlers between 15-25 pounds.The Classic Boba baby carrier is made with quality and practicality in mind.The company is also trying to promote their products using green materials, with this using 100% cotton.It is well padded for the baby and is comfortable on the shoulders.First thing you do is buckle the big belt on your waist.Place the shoulder straps, and then followed by the neck strap.There is a footrest for the baby's feet instead of just dangling around - easily adjustable with a velcro closure.I needed an extra hand to do that, for safety reasons.I guess it needs some learning curve plus the fact that the baby needs to get used to it.(I don't recommend doing this while standing.)The hood is a nice add for cooler weather and unexpected slight drizzle.This is one product that stayed true to it's advertised hype.You can carry your bundle of joy in either front or back.The added feature that was great is the removable hood and the foot straps.The material is 100% natural cotton.Please be sure that your baby meet the weight requirement of 15-45 pounds for safe use of the product.You should really enjoy this soft baby carrier.I haven't used this carrier as much as I thought would, but I like it.We have the Dusk color, and it's nice and neutral (but not black, which is nice for a change).It's really easy to put on and put baby in, which is not always the case with baby carriers (we have a Baby Bjorn, too, which can be confusing to put on).I feel like it does a good job at taking the strain off of my back when I'm carrying my daughter.The only thing that isn't easy about this carrier is trying to put the baby on your back.This might just be because I'm not coordinated, or my daughter is too young to "help" me (she's 10 months old).But feel like I need another set of hands to help put her on my back.Overall, I like this carrier.I have mixed feelings about this one.You can tell it is quality.It's easy to use.It looks more normal than a lot of carriers.My baby is not even quite 15 pounds, but she has good head control already.The back would feel better if it cross across the back.I feel like it's pulling my shoulders making me slouch and have to strain to keep my back straight.I hate to completely discard this carrier in case it works better when she's taller or something.Right now it's impossible to use.I hate baby carriers.Some of that probably has had to do with my budget being low and not wanting to buy an expensive carrier that would go to waste.I debated the Moby wrap but the more I looked at it the scarier it seemed.So I nixed all carriers until I had the chance to get the Boba through the Vine program.(Normally I hate sharing that disclaimer but hey, I wouldn't have been willing to drop the money on it but now that I have it I wish I had done so sooner!)My little one just turned one and weighs about 19lbs.In the month we have been testing out the carrier we've mostly just gone on short walks and she's hung out while I did small tasks.During my pregnancy I was injured in a car accident and have had neck trouble but the design of this carrier puts no strain there!Her weight is very evenly distributed and aside from the fact I'm not comfortable putting her on my back (rangling her into and out of the carrier on my back was too scary) in it yet I've had no issues with my side of things.As for baby?Well... she gets very excited when she sees me pull the Boba out.She enjoys being carried and getting to wiggle more than she can in my arms.She's also at just the right height that she can't get both arms over the straps (as shown in the product photo for the Dusk version) and this really bugs her after a while too.Otherwise we're both comfy and happy.I especially love how comfy the waist fits but I do wonder if it will be too loose on smaller waisted parents.The Boba's materials are nice and the added "hood" is pretty cool but the elastic meant to hold the "hood" part tore right out when I went to put the hood back upon my first time testing.It may be just my carrier had a flaw but I would suggest carefully examining your carrier for any defects just in case.Overall I think this is a good carrier for a baby/toddler in the 15 to probably about 30lb range.The price is a bit high but with this being a carrier you can use for such a wide size range I think you will get your money's worth.This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on theBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Black(4 stars), the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining (5 stars), theInfantino Ecosash Baby Carrier, Bloomin Vines, 8-35 Pounds(3 stars), and theInfantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds(2 stars).Here's her general intro:"I'm 5'5" and around 130 lbs.Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Boba:"This carrier is surprisingly similar to the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining.I use it frequently for my 4-month old (and enjoy it) and save the Ergo for my 2 year old.* The waist band is stiffer than that of the Ergo, which feels more secure for my posture.* I can wear this for hours (only tried with my 18 lb babe) and not feel sore.* The hood is just as effective and simple as that on the Ergo.* The nylon straps are soft and pliable making one handed adjusting easy.* The hood can be removed completely, if for some reason you need to do that.* Breastfeeding while wearing is possible.CONS:* There is no pocket.I find myself sticking my keys into the elastic that is supposed to hold the rolled up hood and have even rolled up my phone INTO the hood -- way too silly for a $100 carrier.* The footstraps are silly.I tried them briefly with my 2-year old (who has never had dangling foot problems in the Ergo) and he was tickled by the novelty of it, but could have cared less otherwise.And when taking him out of the carrier, his foot slipped through the footrest loop and then, as you can imagine, we were in a bind.After we were untangled, I took the footrests off.Those footrests are out to get me.* The shoulder straps are shorter than on the Ergo making the back clip (when in the front-wearing position) meet higher up on the back, which does not feel as supportive to me.I like having the central pull of the carrier in the center of my back.OTHER:* Made in China.I own two different soft-structured baby carriers, this Boba Classic and also an Ergo organic carrier.The strap width, padding, etc look just alike.Here are a few key things I noticed:*The Boba is approximately 3" taller in the body than the Ergo.If you have an older baby/toddler, I'm sure this would be helpful.My daughter is 5 1/2 months old, so at this point, it makes no difference either way.*The Boba has foot straps.Again, these are meant for a toddler.They are easily detachable if you decide to not use them.It's a nice option that perhaps I'll use when the baby is older.The Boba lacks this feature.*The Ergo has areas around the belt where you can attach the Ergo Front Pouch (sold separately).The Boba lacks this feature.*On the Boba, the hood rolls up and is held in place by little elastic rings.It is completely detachable if you choose to do so.With the Ergo, the hood gets rolled up and stuffed into a front pouch.If you don't do this carefully with the Ergo, it bunches up and is bulky.It is not detachable from the carrier.*The Ergo has a D ring on the shoulder strap.*The Ergo has the option for an infant insert (sold separately) which allows you to use it for 8 lbs and up.To my knowledge, the Boba does not have a similar insert available.*The Ergo has an optional hip-carry position.As far as I can figure out, the Boba does not have this feature.That being said, the hip-carry position can really bother your back after awhile.The available colors of the Boba are a bit plain looking, in my opinion.My husband hates wearing our Ergo, because it has big pink flowers and star bursts embroidered on it.So obviously, he much prefers this plain looking carrier.On Boba's website, they say the carrier is meant for toddlers 15 lbs and up.Most babies reach 15 lbs by the time they're 3 to 5 months old though, so I don't understand the "toddler" designation.However, for the various reason I listed above, I would recommend the Ergo carrier over the Boba, unless you are really set on having the foot straps or perhaps if you have a tall toddler that needs the extra height of the Boba carrier.I have used and loved the baby sacks for infants, and this is the next step up.This can be used for front or back carrying, there are stirrups for the child's feet so they not are kicking you or don't get tired from just hanging in space.There is a head covering to use in wind/rain that rolls up and bacomes a back/neck support when not in use.The material is sturdy, easy to clean, and breathable/comfortable.The very best thing about this product is the design.Other products put most of the weight on the adult's neck and one shoulder.The weight is balanced on both shoulders.Once the child is settled, there are straps across the chest and around the waist to help support the weight.As I said, similar to carrying a backpack, there is more support for both the adult and the child.My son-in-law used this with our two grand-children.One child is 19 pounds and in the almost-ready-to-walk stage.Later, he used it on our 4 year old grand-daughter who is small for her age - only 28 pounds and short.He carried her on his back and they both did great, but she is just about too tall to use this product.Overall, this is an excellent product.I consider it the next step up from the slings for infants.For those children who are at the crawling, toddling stage, this is an excellent product.Immediately I noticed the sturdiness of this carrier.The shoulder straps are well padded, as well as the waist.I haven't been able to really use it yet, since baby's not here yet, but I am excited to give it a try.Overall, it has durable features and appears to be well-made.Update: I've been using this for a couple of months now.It is a little difficult to buckle the top buckle with the baby forward facing, but what I've been doing lately is loosening it up before I put it on, that way there's a lot of slack in the straps and I can reach them more easily.I began using this product in the summer of 2011 and it's now broken!A part of the large plastic buckle that closes around your waist snapped.I am so bummed because with my toddler who weighs around 30 pounds and  won't stay in a shopping cart, the Boba is how I get my grocery shopping done.I was expecting it to last longer than this.I don't feel I heavily used the Boba.I've just used it for shopping, mainly.Two slings, a baby Bjorn, Snugli and finally an Ergobaby.The sleeping shade is not removable and gets in the way, the body support was a little short for larger kids.The Boba addresses these and also adds foot stirrups.One side effect of the longer body support is that it's really not suitable for infants - the Ergo was marginal for infants anyways, even with their "infant support insert" so I don't see this as a huge down side.The Ergo has longer straps which are a little awkward but allowed us to use it as a side carry.Finally, I was glad to see that Boba made their sleeping shade removable.There's no such thing as a one size fits all - what you prefer will depend on what you are doing, how large the child is and your physique.For newborns I preferred the Bjorn for being able to put the child in quickly, but since it puts the weight entirely on your shoulders the Bjorn wasn't practical for extended use or when the child got to perhaps 12-15 lbs.Bottom line: Would I prefer the Boba over the Ergo?It's hard to say.Given the features and price point I'd say it's a toss-up, if Ergo was to incorporate some minor improvements and match the price, I'd probably go with the Ergo again.If you found this review helpful or have questions/comments, please let me know!This fits my Valco Rad stroller w/the foot rest flipped up, and it also fits my Combi Shuttle (the up to 22lb one).The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I was expecting the signature JJ Cole Bundleme lining..this is thinner..but still very nice and better quality than regular shower cap style car seat covers!The top zips off to put baby it..it says it zips to grow with baby..but it literally just zips off...no extending or anything like it leads you to believe.So when its off you just have the part that is around the car seat and nothing covers baby..i guess its so you dont have to take it off the seat to put baby in..For starters, this carrier will certainly do its job of carrying Baby in a secure and comfortable fashion.This was a carrier that didn't scare me about falling apart and dropping its precious cargo.One definitely needs to learn how to work it before using it.It's a great, comfy carrier that is supportive, but I don't recommend it for those looking for something a little simpler.I have known Infantino to make high quality stuff and the Baby Balance Carrier is no exception.The first Infantino product we owned, I just checked, is no longer a current product.We discovered it had a strap that was coming loose and the superb customer service at Infantino quickly replaced it and it worked great so when the time came to upgrade to a bigger carrier, it was natural to try another Infantino product.At first glance, the Baby Balance carrier is a bit confusing to use.The fact this particular carrier has such a wide-range of age-groups and weights for which it has been designed, I felt some passing confusion as to which carry style (there are three: back, front facing out, front facing in) which a reading of the manual quickly dispelled--it was to be the back carry which requires a second pair of helping hands.As a product reviewer & active parent, we have tried over 25 different brands of carriers.)(2) If you are an active person (or committed to a lot of contact with your baby), no single carrier will meet all your needs.I personally have 3 carriers - one for around the house, one super-portable for light errands, and the Boba for hiking, camping, long outings.That said, this Infantino lands in the bottom half of the list.It is a copy-cat of the Boba, but cheaper in every way:* Cheap fasteners & hardware* Fabric frays, loose stitching* Low quality parts* Not enough fabric where it counts* Straps are just a bit too short to be truly comfortableKeep in mind, if you've never tried on another carrier before, you may not notice some of these things.But I am *comparing* this to about 25 other carriers, and find the Infantino products are almost always inferior.For a heavy-duty carrier, the most important feature is a *HIP BELT* (like a high quality camping backpack) which distributes the weight on the hips.Most carriers put the weight on your back or neck - which gets old really fast.This Infantino is a knock-off of the Boba, which has a quality hip belt.The problem is, the Infantino belt is too short (they skimped on fabric where it counts the most), and doesn't rest on the hips correctly...unless you have a 24" waist.I realize the Boba is twice the price.In my opinion it's worth it (can you really put a price tag on back pain?).Anyway, here are some others to consider:The Maya sling is one of our favorites.Just buy a set of Maya rings, and pick out your favorite fabric.Even a novice can make one themselves.The Moby is similar to Maya,Moby Wrap Baby Carrier, with many of the same advantages, but a little bulkier.It's difficult to wear the baby on the side with a Moby.I still give Moby very high ratings, but we like the Maya better.The side-carriers are nice (baby is off to side, almost under arm).I keep a side carrier for use around the house (cooking, washing dishes, even light yard work).But all the weight is on your neck/back, and it's not versatile for "outings".I only use it around the house, but it takes 2 seconds to slip on/off, and I end up using it for about 2 hours a day.Scootababy Baby CarrierBaby Bjorn is definitely a Top 5 choice.This is what we use for light outings (to the farmer's market, mall, etc).Much lighter/thinner/sleeker than the Boba.Good for mom or dad.BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier OriginalPlease don't confuse Boba with the "Balboa".If you're a Dr Sears fan (I am not) then you've seen his endorsements of the Balboa (available in Target stores).However, this is similar to the design which got recalled in January 2010 (suffocation issues).They made some adjustments so it's probably safer now, but the bottom line is ANY sling-style carrier which "cinches" the sides (with elastic, etc) keeps your baby hidden and risks smothering.I'm sure 99% of people who own this have never had a problem, but I don't like it.I also give it high ratings - but I also find it a bit bulkier, and since there is no need to have two carriers of the same design, I prefer the Boba.I hope this information helps.For the money I found the Infantino Balance Baby Carrier to be worth the price.It's not as expensive as other brands but it is a good substitute.What you will not get for the money is a carrier that has wide straps.Is a two-in-one which means it is both a front and back carrier.As a front carrier the child will snuggle close to the chest.If your little one gets over stimulated easily then this is definitely for her.As a back carrier there is built in lumbar support which for an averaged sized child is comfortable.As a back carrier the child hugs close to the body as well but is able to see things a lot better than when in front.All in all a good purchase for the money.I say this and my son is not yet 30 pounds (around 27) so believe me, the 35 pound maximum has got to be a really extreme maximum!My theory is that at first there is nothing like the security of both arms wrapped nicely around a little baby to know that the baby isn't going to be dropped or bumped into anything, and only with the wisdom of a few months of tired arms does that security slowly and surely move toward the inevitable appreciation for a baby carrier.What makes the transitional experience a little more stressful is that there is adjusting to do along the way... remember the little undercurrent of stress you first had when putting your baby into a car seat that you buckled in?Are they too loose?"When you're not familiar with the set-up, it's that kind of stress.We didn't get the baby carrier when he was first born, so he might have been pushing 20 pounds at the time; he was too big to be strapped onto my admittedly too big belly (something a manufacturer won't tell you... they'll give size limits on the baby, but if you're a big person as well... that's something to think about).For the duration of our ownership of the Infantino Balance, that's how we used it, my wife and I.There's nothing like experience with these sorts of things, and that's how you get it.Truly, the front-side carrier might be meant for the smallest babies, and her baby also likes to see everything, so it's not ideal that there is no front-facing, front-side option.We both felt that having the baby on our back was meant for babies a little bit older, but still smaller in size.If you take a look at the blonde baby in the pictures for this piece, that's a good age to have this product.All of these quirks having been mentioned, I have to say that the product is very well made and well-padded where it should be.the device works quite well.I haven't had the experience with the "crotch-hanging" baby carriers, and I'm glad I avoided those; my gut impression is that this kind of carrier is the way to go.The price, also, is very reasonable, I think.All in all, I'd like to give the Infantino Balance 3.5 stars, but I'm listing it at three instead of four because my advice to new parents is that they should know about the wieght limit being a bit deceiving; for lighter, younger babies, this is a very good product, and I recommend it.This is one of those products that I feel like is just a short way off from being excellent.It does so many things well that I almost feel bad giving it only three stars.He falls asleep in it almost immediately and stays that way for a long time.3) Easy to load our son in and out of--the whole front can be lowered to get him in and out with ease.4) Comes with a little 'burp guard' to keep things clean when baby is spitting up.5) Very secure, and safe.6) Better for newborns and little baby's pelvis than carriers with leg holes.I am a 6' 2" 200lb dad.Not a giant by any stretch, but the carrier cannot be adjusted so that it sits low enough on my hips.It ends up causing me lower back strain over time.There is simply no way to get it to sit the way it should--think of a good backpack for example--it's always 'floating' on my chest and I'm either supporting it with ridged shoulders or with a ridged lower back.An adjustable strap or cross-hatching would solve that problem and made this a much better carrier for taller folks.A few other thoughts:My wife, who is 5' 7", finds this much more comfortable.My wife has a really well made baby sling (handmade by a friend) which is extraordinarily great, but not really the sort of thing I feel comfortable using as a dad.I liked this carrier because it seemed like a good alternative for a male.Sadly, it's just not that comfortable.It's great for 30 minutes, and terrible for anything longer than that.If you're shorter, you may have no issues with it.If you're taller like me, you may want to look elsewhere.It feels secure.Will write after using it more often.I can't imagine carrying a 30-pound infant, though.This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on theBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Black(4 stars), the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining (5 stars), theInfantino Ecosash Baby Carrier, Bloomin Vines, 8-35 Pounds(3 stars), and theBoba Classic Baby Carrier, Glacier(4 stars).Here's her general intro:"I'm 5'5" and around 130 lbs.Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Balance:"Infantino really put some thought into this soft structured carrier, but just didn't get it quite right.It offers some different and new features that I haven't seen from Ergo or Boba, but overlooked some obvious ones too.The price is nice though!PROS:* As the other reviews suggest, it is a great value for the money.* It is well-built with soft material.* Infantino really tried to think of everything:- It comes with a plastic bib type attachment to save your clothes from spit-ups (though there are no directions for it and it is not advertised).- Its straps connect to the belt itself, instead of the body of the carrier (as on the Ergo and Boba), so it has an extra buckle from the straps to the body - I believe this design is so that it can accommodate the 8-pounders.- All of the straps have elastic at the end for consolidating the extra length.* It's $50 less than its competitors!!Yay for cheaper baby-wearing!CONS:* There is no hood/flap for sleeping baby or weather protection, which is really the biggest disappointment in my opinion.* There are a lot of buckles (two more than the Ergo or Boba), which makes it harder to get on alone (but we moms can get used to anything).* The nylon straps themselves are of a cheaper quality than other carriers in this review making them stiffer, stick out more, and harder to tighten with one hand.* While there is a pocket, it is just a sewed on extra piece of fabric, forcing whatever you put into it to stick into the back of the child.OTHER:* I have tried this on a 12 pound infant, an 18 pound infant and 35 pound toddler.* This carrier was made in China, designed in California.I tried this out on my two toddlers (Yes, I mean one at a time.)and I really didn't like it at all.For a front carry, you first tie the bottom strap around your waist, then sit the baby in your lap facing you, then throw the top straps over your shoulders and somehow crisscross them behind you and bring them around and through loops on the sides of the front that are much smaller than the straps and then tie those shoulder straps behind the baby's back.And you must do all that with one hand on the baby.Once I had my little guy inside, he did seem pretty secure, but I was a little annoyed by the strap ends hanging down the front because they were longer than necessary and I was afraid they'd be a hazard of some sort.There was easily two feet of cloth hanging down where I couldn't see it because of the baby.I didn't try the front carry facing out because it looked terribly uncomfortable for the little ones.Mine are a little heavy in front now and I thought it might be nice to carry one on my back on occasion, but this carrier isn't going to do it for me.I didn't want to take my hand off and keeping your hands free is a big reason to use a carrier.You have to really wad up the carrier to make it fit and I'm not sure how clean it would get going through the wash in a ball.It's patterned on one side and plain black on the other.It's like the designer thought, "People might think this is ugly, we should make it so they can hide it."To turn this part around you have to mess with four sides of velcro.Dads in particular, since they likely have broader shoulders than I, could find it a good fit as a backpack.But I used aBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Blackfor all four of my kids when they were smaller and I still consider that the gold standard in front carriers.First let me say that I love the material of this baby carrier.It is very attractive.It is not like the Baby Bjorn carrier which is very easy to work with when adjusting and putting it on.I also had a hard time making the leg adjustment work.But I advise you give it a test run before purchasing.So check with a friend who owns one and uses it all the time.The Infantino Ecosash baby carrier is slightly different from most of the carriers you see in the market today - it has the mei tai straps, which means you adjust them to fit your body.The majority of baby carriers have buckles and straps where you can pull the ends to fit your body.* It takes more time to assemble and prep the carrier.It may be that if you use it a lot, that it becomes second nature.But because I'm pretty risk-averse, I like to make sure everything is tied secure, so it takes me much longer to put on this carrier than it does with one that has buckles and straps that can be adjusted while wearing the carrier.This is my biggest complaint for the carrier.* The fabric feels thick.I don't know if it's to hide dirt (or spit-up), or because they thought it would be more gender-neutral if you could use the black for men and patterned one for women.I'd rather have a pouch to store extra diapers/wipes in.Overall, it is a decent carrier, especially for the price.However, there were enough drawbacks (the time element) for me to rate it as good, but not great.I love the design and all-cloth feel of the carrier, but at the same time, it just didn't overall work for this mom of three on the go.I have three small children and have been babywearing [my infants-3 years old's] for almost 5 years.If there is a baby carrier out there, I've probably not only tried it, but own it.My favorite to date has been the Ergo, but this seems like a good backup, but only for a non-novice babywearer.Here's why:Pros:1.Padded shoulders3.Versatility [you can wear on back, front, side [not suggested, but i liked it that way] and front facing out.4.Easy to wrap up and stick in a purse [all cloth]5.Baby liked it6.Similar to the Mei Tai8.Great for all types of body typesOne thing that does stick out to me is it's ability to be worn so many different ways.That's really genius.The bjorn is known for being able to front face out, but has not backpack option, the Ergo can be worn on front and back, but no front facing out option.Cons:1.The straps are nearly 6 feet long so putting on in public=straps touching nasty ground2.Doesn't feel as secure to me as other carriers with snaps & belts to buckle3.Not easy for a new babywearer [large learning/adjusting curve]4.Harder to put on alone than other carriers5.Seems like it loosens & needs to be more often readjusted6.I own 4 different styles of baby carriers.Except for this product, I can actually double up on the carriers and carry both my twin infants at once.Because this product, Infantino Ecosash featured the back carrying, I had been hoping to be able to carry one of my infants in the back and one in the front.However, it wasn't quite possible w/ the way it's positioned.With the positioning in front, the carrier and infant is in the center of your chest.From the back, the straps are in the way.On an individual basis, Baby Bjorn active sport remains the best of all the baby carriers I've used out there for it's great back support and ease of use.This product was extremely cumbersome to install the infant whether it was back or front.My babies are roughly 14 lbs each, and their arms kept shifting inward and getting stuck.At home, you can sit down and handle the baby for the front and back.But if you were using this product on the go, it would be extremely difficult to get the baby in w/o another person helping.Not to mention the sash straps would drag all over the ground.While the front carry position was an ok load, it didn't have the back support like the Baby Bjorn did.In addition, if carrying from the back, the straps kept slipping off my shoulders.I actually don't recommend using this product from the back, it seemed a little unsafe for the infants.Whether using the back or front option, the extra sash from the tie is quite long and you have to tie several times to prevent it dangling strangely on you.Overall, I can't quite recommend this product.First of all, I should say that I have a very, very low opinion of Infantino because of their "bag sling" the slingrider, which they left on the market for years after moms in the babywearing community warned them repeatedly that it (as well as all bag slings) was dangerous.In fact, they never recalled it voluntarily, the CPSC had to issue a recall.That said, I actually liked some things about this carrier, although I don't recommend it overall.I've owned a few of them, as well as ring slings, pouch slings, structured soft carriers (like the Ergo), and wraps of all kinds.Mei tais are my favorite for extended wearing, when the baby is not in and out of the carrier often, because they are difficult to get into.This carrier in particular has some pros and cons:Pros:- very supportive of a heavier, larger baby.My baby is almost at the max weight limit (35 lbs.)and we enjoyed it.- nice, neutral color- detachable hood - very helpful!- the PRICE!See below.- the detachable/reversible panel is annoying.So much bulk and fuss for such an unimportant thing (to me) just got in the way.- there are "instruction" panels in a stiff satin fabric ALL OVER this thing.There are panels identifying which is the top, which is the waist, how to wear your baby, the weight limits, etc.I really appreciate the pocket in all my baby carriers that have them.The shoulder straps are only long enough to tie around the body of the carrier, as seen in the picture.That is, if you're wearing your baby on the front, you cross the straps over your back, bring them around under your arms and cross them over the front panel of the mei tai (where the picture above would have you tie them, instead you cross them or twist them), then tuck the straps under baby's legs and tie them on the small of your back where the waist straps are tied.All in all, I would invest more money in a better mei tai, or find one used for a comparable price with better features.The annoying labels and the length of the straps really make it unusable for me.Maybe it be a good starter mei tai to learn, but I think YouTube videos and thebabywearer.com, combined with a quality WAHM-made carrier would be a much better and safer way to learn.Infantino is behind the curve on making baby carriers, and I would avoid buying from them in the future.note: I received this carrier for free with the Amazon Vine program.My husband and I are putting together a hope chest for the future little one and this was a perfect addition!We wanted a way to carry our child close to us.This product is eco friendly, has no buckles to irritate baby's skin, and is soft.This feels to me like a cross between the slings and the carriers.I always like the concept of a baby sling (and I know some people swear by them) but I could never get one comfortable on me so I used the traditional backpacks and a Borjn front carrier.What I like about this carrier is it feels so comfortable on.The material is very soft and the pattern is pretty.There are not all of the buckles and straps that need to be adjusted with each new wearer.You just tie it on and it actually stays tied.The best part is I need to have only one carrier for the front or the back.It has a great mesh sack to store it in and keep it handy for trips.Based on some of the other reviews this might be one of those products you should try on first (with your baby inside) to make sure it is right carrier for you.We have mixed feelings about this carrier.I have not tried it for any very long stretches, some opinions might change after doing that, but I don't see this carrier as a haul your kids all day kind of carrier, or a strenuous activity carrier, which I think require a carrier geared to give the adult more support and proper weight distribution.That said, I think it has a good place in our arsenal of "Littles Transport"The ugly: the straps are ridiculously long and somewhat effeminate.I can deal, but I'm not thrilled about it (guys carry kids too!).The bad: it claims to be simple, but is actually difficult to figure out and not easy to use.The backside of the carrier is quite tall, presumably to allow for the carrying of bigger kids - but even our two-year old can barely see out.That may not be a problem for our infant (who is almost invisible in it, but two-year olds like to see, and don't like to be squished.If your kids like to get in and out, it's a hassle and time consuming.The shoulder straps just don't feel all that secure - maybe it is the way I have adjusted it, but I feel like they are always about to slip off my shoulders.The good: I'm a pretty big guy and the use of tie-able straps is a huge plus.Most carriers seem to be geared for small women and I simply cannot use them because they don't have enough slack in the straps.So, it's a huge plus that I can actually use the carrier at all.Moreover when you have a sleepy kid, the close-to-you / squishy nature is more of a benefit, and the "can't see out" gives them a good place to knock off for a few hours.And so, four stars.Good be better, but it does things I can't get elsewhere.This review is part of a round of reviews of baby carriers my wife wrote, including her takes on theBABYBJ&Ouml;RN Baby Carrier Original - City Black, the Ergo Baby Carrier Black with Camel Lining, theInfantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds, and theBoba Classic Baby Carrier, Glacier.Here's her general intro:"I'm 5'5" and around 130 lbs.Our children seem to grow quickly, both over 15 lbs by 3 months of age, so a good carrier is vital to the health of our backs!There are many features to each carrier that I will try to touch on, and most of them have both pros and cons associated, so I might say one feature is a benefit, but I may also mention its drawbacks, or vice versa.We all have differently tempered and built babes and toddlers, differently shaped bodies, and different needs, so please take these reviews for what they're worth: my humble opinions.And here's her take on the Ecosash:"Overall, I think this is a really cute mei tai carrier and at a great price.Infantino impressed me with the thought, design, and quality they put into it.If they do a redesign (are you reading this, Infantino?)they should re-think the velcro tie for the face-out position and use snaps or something more secure and less less bunchy.PROS:* Great packaging, well designed, comes with a mesh bag for washing.You can face them forward, toward you, or wear them on your back.* The loops to feed the straps through are nice in that they help keep a consistent tension preventing the knot from slipping up and loosening the shoulder straps.* The head rest is great and supports my baby's head well when facing me.I like the fact that you can make the baby nice and close to your chest or let them hang a little away from you (a function of its being a mei tai).* There is a hood/flap that can snap to the head rest to protect baby from a light drizzle or the hot sun.* It's also pretty fancy that you can change the panel from patterned to black, though not necessary for simple moms like myself.I can carry my 16 lb baby for a couple of hours and feel only a little sore.CONS:* I personally find the long lengths of fabric somewhat cumbersome, as opposed to a buckle-type carrier.* The decorative panel is fastened with velcro running its border, which makes that part of the carrier somewhat stiff.Even with a three month old, I find she tends to sink lower and lower.I compare this with the Bjorn, which by design keeps the baby upright and in a constant position.* When transitioning from facing in and out (or vice versa), you will have to put the baby down and take off the carrier to reconfigure the carrier and relace the straps, etc when putting back on.OTHER:* Made in China, designed in California.* Instructions for wearing are printed on the carrier itself.The product itself is made very well and I really like the print on it and you can use it to put the child up front or in the back.It also comes with a hoodie that I also like for the colder days.I have had several baby carriers in my 7 years as a mom.Fits heavier babies which is a plus in my book as I never wore babies that could not support their own heads.It would be a good idea to see if a few friends have carriers they are willing to let you try out for the day just to see what works for you.If not possible then this one is a nice starter.I purchased this product for my grandbaby.He immediately was drawn to all of the different things that can be done with this toy.I purchased this with 3 other toys, and he seemed to be drawn to this the most.It's a little big to take out to dinner, but it's super cute to have at home.I think they will be once they sit up (they are 5 months old now).Their 1 year old friend can't get enough of this toy.Very soft and they wash very nicely.Update 12/10/11:  They still hold their shape after being washed three times a week for almost one year.They are not nearly as soft as they once were.That is unfortunate, but expected after so much use.We use them wet, so it is not a problem for us.Just got this cup holder today...it came free with a new Advocate 70CS we just purchased.Don't have the Advocate as yet but I thought I would try it on my 6 month old Boulevard 70CS and as previous reviewers have indicated there are no cutouts in the plastic below the fabric to allow the holder to snap in place.I am somewhat astonished that Britax is doing this, especially since the box indicates that the holder is good for the Boulevard.I called Britax and it turns out that the boulevard 70 and 70CS will fit.NOTE:  The britax boulevard will not fit.Apparently, the 70s series are newer.On the box of this cup holder it states it will fit:  roundabout 55, marathon70, boulevard 70, boulevard 70CS, and advocate 70CS.You can find out the exact model of your car seat by looking at a label sewn on the car seat cover at where the child's head rests.You can also check underneath the sides of the car seat for slots, after lifting up the car seat cover.Too bad... it would have been a very nice addition.The baby bjorn I had, even with "lumbar support", killed my shoulders after my baby was about 12 lbs.But now he's taller at 6 months and he fits great and I LOVE my Ergo!!I chose this monitor based on reviews here and on other websites.It is a replacement for a summer infant sleek and secure video monitor that broke several times and was only 4 mths old!Very clear.I will update if any changes!This product doubles as a device for pouring water over a baby's body and as floating bath time toys.I love that this product is very unique.I haven't seen anything like this down any baby aisle.It's a functional accessory for bath time.This laundry scoop sticks to the washing machine and doesn't get lost!I was very disappointed to find that the description listed for this product was incorrect.It lists as having a fleece lining.Otherwise this weather cover is a good product.They worked well, but were bulky when the twins weighed under 7 lbs.They were able to move their arms better and were able to flip onto their stomachs by then (4 months).I worried about them not being able to flip back over, so I switched to just a wearable blanket where their arms are out.It is way too steep for this.But  this is only my opinion.I broke one in less than a week....They should be bulkier!It fits nicely on my maclaren techno xt stroller.Not sure about maclaren XLR.I also used the platform as a bath stool.The pad is soft and comfy for my baby.we dont use the seat now as the baby is sitting up.we have never had a problem with it.This bouncer's vibrate stays on until you turn it off.I think this is a great product.It does exactly what it's supposed to--keeps my 5 month old's head in one place while nursing.He is at the stage where he has trouble concentrating on nursing because so much else is going on around him.When I wear this necklace, he can focus on nursing more because the interesting ring is right in front of him.I put this on my Amazon registry and noticed how it kept going out of stock.Once it came back into stock, I just ordered it myself.I love the SkipHop collection, and this little guy is so cute.Also, the product is a great size.I picked this activity gym over the hundreds available on the market mainly because Amazon states under its material type as cotton.I really try to avoid purchasing baby products that are polyester.My daughter absolutely loves laying on this and staring at the animals.She actually did her "tummy time" the longest she's ever done with this.It gives me 20 to 30 minutes a day to get things done and she even fell asleep on it once.Babies aren't too picky about how things are designed and can be amused by the simplest things.it stopped working last week after only about 13 months.i found this and the glowing, new reviews apparently from this amazon vine program.all the reviews were from the last month?however, i will not buy this until a year or two down the road when there are more "real" reviews.but i guess i would've given this 5 stars the first week of using this too.there's another company that makes something similar and there's a aaa battery version of the tykelight.I hesitate to give "only" three stars here, because this seems to be a well made, sturdy product, that does what it advertises.However, there are two big issues that make me recommend other products in this category, which I would probably call "toddler or baby night light/soother".First, the good:- Very well made, construction is quality, soft touch material is pleasing- Almost fascinating to watch, color changes are slow and beautiful, really- Love the fact that it is rechargeable via a base- Lasts forever with the new lithium ion batteries- Timer function seems just about right (off after 15 minutes)- BPA free!Great idea!The relatively bad (I say "relatively" because if this were the only soft plastic, light changing, night light/soother out there, I would probably give it 5 stars):- Packaging.Hard-to-open clamshell style, but even harder than normal due to how tightly the plastic shell is "wrapped" around the product.And yes, I sliced the ^&#%$^ out of my finger opening it (not from my box cutter, but from the insanely sharp, cut plastic shell).:)  Your fingers have been warned.- First biggy con:  TOO BRIGHT.When my kids first saw this Tykelight as I took it out of the box, they were excited after I extracted it from its deadly, booby trap packaging (and I cleaned up the ensuing blood).Because this thing floods your room with light!Granted, it's a pleasing, soothing light, and the color changes are almost organic and nice, BUT...who can go to sleep with that kind of light level?Especially considering that most modern pediatricians recommend as dark a room as possible to get optimum sleep quality.I wish I had a light meter so I could measure it.A mediocre workaround is to put the unit behind something big, like a picture frame, or some other light blocking object, but then, that kind of defeats the purpose somewhat, doesn't it?(and even the indirect light from the thing is STILL too bright IMO)  Disappointed, but maybe not a deal breaker for some, depending on how you like your sleeping light levels.So now we use this in our bedroom, where our 2 week old is, to assist with all night feedings and diaper changes, etc.- Biggest con:  unlike other similar units, this Tykelight has a TINY black plastic button on the BASE of the unit.Crucial design mistake, imo (again, relative to other similar products like this).So kind of torn here, I actually DO like the product a lot, but can't recommend only because there are other things out there (like this insanely highly recommended turtle for one:Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtlethat are better (we also have the turtle, and it is truly awesome).I gave the previous edition a 5 star too.However, it wound up with problems a few months later.Specifically, the colors stopped working.This one looks like it fits the base better, and it seems more durable.Having an 8 year old granddaughter, the Mobi "Tykelight Glomate Plus" has quickly become one of our favorite things at bed time when she visits since our older Victorian house is somewhat large and can be scary at night.This requires several hours to charge before using it, but it easily comes to full capacity if left on the base during the day.My daughter loved this guy, for two days.After the second night of use, I went to put it back on the charging station and noticed it didn't light up (red or green).Hmm, wiggled the cord, nothing.So on day 3, it's being sent back to Amazon (very impressed with how painless the return/exchange process has been).I'm hoping that we just got a dud, my daughter really liked the rainbow feature, and I liked how child friendly this little guy appeared to be.Edit: Well, #2 has worked fine since arrival with none of the problems of #1.It lights up the room (quite brightly) and lasts most of the night, roughly 10+ hours.The exchange with Amazon was painless, #2 arrived within 2 days, before I had even had a chance to return #1.I'm hoping that this one lasts quite awhile, as my daughter finds it the most useful nightlight we've tried.The GloMate can show single colors (blue, green, orange) or a rotating rainbow.The one immense advantage you'll have with the GloMate is portability: you can move the light wherever you like, this is not tied to an outlet and with ten hours of operating time on a full charge, you don't have to worry about it going out anytime soon.It immediately captivated my baby's attention and with time, he now wants it in the bedroom with him as he drifts off to sleep.Very handy.It has solid red, blue or green options -- and then one that cycles through.The cycling mode is her favorite.There are periods where it's orange, pink and purple as it goes between red, blue and green.Setup is completely easy, the charge lasts for 10 hours.It's very easy to tell if the unit is charging or not when you set it into the base.My daughter uses the tykelight for soothing herself to sleep.I highly recommend this and love the versatility of many different color options in one product.His surface is hard, but he is shaped to fit into a hand or to cuddle against your side when walking around a dimly lit or dark room.At first when I saw this product, I thought it was just for toddlers; but it's a great "almost there" item for kids who are older yet still afraid of being in the dark.UPDATE 2/15/2011: My little guy is now 12.5mos and loved his little Mobi glowfriend.That said, he handled it a lot and while it appeared to be no worse for the wear because of that, there's something wonky going on with the way it connects to the charger base.It appears to still charge, but the red-to-green base ring the indicates charge doesn't stay steadily on.Sometimes it flickers between the two.Other times, the Glomate suddenly turns on while on the base, just as if it was on that 15-minute removal timer.That light gave off an amberish glow that I'd always felt was a little too bright.Not that I recommend it as a teething toy BUT if your little happens to mouth about 90% of the body you probably don't have to freak.The light options are nice, but quite bright in an otherwise pitch dark room.And I swear I see a 'heart' shape in the light.Half the time, I actually just rely on the green 'charged' ring indicator due to its brightness.Though if Mobi man isn't resting evenly on the charger it causes the ring light to flicker.Overall a cute and very kid-friendly night light.I sort of love this thing.So far, no problems with it being defective as others have reported.The base is the kind where you just sit it in there, so you do have to wiggle it a bit to get it to charge.Like many kids, I was afraid of the dark - or rather afraid of the crazy shadows the half dark would make in my room.Having this guy by my side would have been a great comfort.I could have turned it on when I wanted, used the timer so I got the nightlight feature when falling asleep, but it wasn't on all night, or just left it on all night.It's not cuddly per-say, but it's kid safe and cute enough to snuggle up with a bit before going to bed or while falling asleep (then it could just end up wherever - it's pretty sturdy feeling if it gets lost in the bed - or a parent could come fetch it and put it back on the charger).For parents: It turns on automatically when removed from the base (but you can turn it off).Likewise, if it is on the base and you lose power, it will turn on automatically.Will reportedly last even longer when not on rainbow.As long as they company fixes all the reported problems with so many being defective, I think this is a really cool thing that you'd probably buy first just because you think it's cute, then end up using the heck out of it.I have a friend who is having a baby soon, and this might be going in her shower gift!This is a great toy for 5+ year-old toddlers.My toddler was able to figure out a way to get to its bulb by disassembling it with her small fingers.This is the only reason it gets four stars instead of five.For adults, this is a cool little light that can come in handy in a number of ways.For example, it can be used as a handy light source when you can't find a flash in an area where there is no light.I can also see it coming in VERY handy if you're going on an overnight camping trip.The best thing about it is that it is rechargeable and the built-in battery lasts very long.I did not own the older version, but this new version is super bright, and super nice.So it's a nightlight... it's bright enough you can see your way around but dark enough that at 2am you don't feel like you are looking into the sun.I like it for reasons I can't really put into words and my kids like it so I'm glad I got it.My toddle will grab this thing and carry it to the bathroom at 2am without issue.Good light level and colorsCons:Packaging was evilCharging base sometimes requires a bit of playing with to get it seated to charge (you get a red/green light or no light so it's not so bad) I've already got my 2yr old trainded to take it off and put it on again if he doesn't see a light after he's put it on the baseThis is the coolest nightlight; seriously!The design is cute and easy to hold, it's lightweight, and feels durable.It also didn't take long to charge up.I think straight out of the box I had it on the charger for less than 30 minutes and it was glow ready and in my son's room for a couple hours without going out.It's bright like a flashlight but not in a blaring-in-your-face-bright-light kind of way.The only downside I can see so far is it could feel a bit bright if you're trying to sleep, at least my husband thinks so, I don't.I have to admit, I have always wanted a Mobi light, but I never thought I had anyone to give it to!I love that he shuts down after 15 minutes and falls asleep himself!The only thing I can't comment on just yet is his battery life, but so far, he is going strong!I would certainly purchase one for a friend!I definitely recommend it.I got this to try out before buying similar for a few pregnant friends.I wanted something soft they could use to feed the baby by but that would also be useful in the first few years.There were several pluses and minuses.It is a soft light so it doesn't hurt tired eyes but it does illuminate every area of a room.That button is hard to find in the dark even with the impressive lighting range.It comes with its own lithium battery and charging stand.I did have to move it around when putting it on the stand a few times - it doesn't always sit tightly.My 2 year old did like it and we replaced his old night light.It is 'soft to the touch' but not soft overall.It's hard vinyl with a smoothy surface.As such, I don't know that I'd want my child teething a giant lightbulb and lithium battery.There are enough inexpensive teethers on the market for that.Certainly, it is too hard to be in the crib if the child falls asleep.In all, I do like it.If the Glomate is in the off/no light mode and a child wakes up and need the light, he/she can see the lighted base, then when the GloMate if picked up, it automatically turns on with a soft light.The GloMate is not a flashlight because there is no directed beam, but it does give off enough light to satisfy children who may be afraid of the dark, and the GloMate's  stance looks like lifted arms, ready for a hug.There are several colors from a soft green, to soft blue, and soft red.The packaging says 10 hours.I have not let it go overnight, but I have let it stay on for six hours and the light was steady and undimmed the entire time.Now for the bad news: the switch on the bottom of the GloMate says to hold the button until the display light flickers/pulses to move from one mode to another for different colors or for constantly changing colors.I could never get it to a particular color I wanted, nor could I get it to go into the mode of self-changing colors.I did get all the colors and the self-changing mode eventually, but they were all a surprise to me, and I could never tell what I was going to get.So if you or your child need control of this aspect of the product, you will be VERY frustrated.However, if you don't care and you are satisfied with whatever you get, like my grand-daughter, then you will be fine.My 4 year old grand-daughter was so excited about this GloMate - just in time for Halloween - that she didn't care what it did.Another caution - the packaging says "soft,friendly, safe".Yes, it appears friendly with it hug attitude, and it is safe if the switch is not put in the mouth, but it is NOT soft.I've already mentioned the problem with getting the cycling, but you should also know that the only colors are red, blue, green - no violet, no yellow, so no rainbow.Finally, the packaging says there is a "15-minute dim to sleep mode" but I was never able to get it to go out like that.Over all, this is a great product as a nightlight.I would not call it a "toy" but it is a good nightlight for those little ones in your family who need this kind of comfort.Our four year old was fine with no night light but recently started to insist on one.The problem is that most night lights are really too bright and we would prefer not to have it on all night.This night light has one great feature - you can set it to turn itself off after 15 minutes -Setting the night light on the base charges it - I never noticed any issue with the contacts.The night light also comes on automatically when you remove it from the charger or if the base unit is unplugged (or the power goes out)You can cycle through colors or have it on a changing color setting - this setting even fascinated our 7 year old.Some improvements I'd want1) Default to red - blue light is too intense and will tend to keep you up, red won't ruin your night vision or keep your kids awake.2) Shorter press to change from on all night mode to the 15 minute delay mode3) Default at all times to 15 minute delay mode4) 30 minute delay instead of 15 minutes.You may want to consider the Vessel Guardian or Tooli lights - this is a very similar product except that the plug is a Electroluminescent light (which is quite dim) and there are no contacts (it charges via induction)  We have three of these.The only downside is that there are no colors and there is no delay mode.It's easy on my eyes and there are lots of different things in this toy for my baby to play with.I'm really baffled by the positive reviews for this chair.I think people are writing reviews for it right out of the box, not after actually using it.I also now hate the wood tray - wish I had plastic to clean more easily and so I can attach suction-cup base toys to it which is impossible with wood.* The whole chair gets loose easily.It is easy to assemble in a way that's not aligned properly and thus makes the chair loose; call the company for instructions on how to assemble if this happens, I had to do that.* It's designed for a toddler so it's very uncomfortable for a baby.I have the cushions but they are an awkward fit for the baby and don't help much.I have a fussy unhappy guy each meal due to the discomfort of this chair and have to feed him quickly before he will simply refuse to eat because he wants out.This alone means I must invest in a different chair.This is one of our can't live without purchases.This is one of the few baby play gyms that doesn't have gaudy colors or irritating (to me at least) toys.Garden themed, it includes things like carrots, a bumblebee, a cabbage mirror, and other large, attractive toys perfect for our 2 month old.He enjoys laying on the boppy and taking whacks at the hanging toys, although he's not coordinated enough to connect regularly!He smiles at the toys as much or more than he smiles at mom and dad, to our chagrin.The design of the pay gym is great.The top structure which the toys hang from allows you to move the toys to different places using a simple button method.He is only 2 mos.right now, and I fully expect to get a lot of mileage out of this gym before he outgrows it.I was pretty impressed by this play gym.It's three-legged support system wants to spring into place and doesn't get accidentally folded and knocked down as much as a result.The dangling toys are also great!They easily attach and detach to the gym by slipping leafy ends through small holes on the support, and the plush carrots, for example, have a pleasant sounding rattle when batted around, other attachments crinkle and a cute butterfly lights up and makes music.One thing to note, however, is that the "mini Boppy" that comes with the system is just to give baby some support for sitting up.It's less than 1/2 the size of a real Boppy and it wouldn't be able to be used for breast feeding like its larger counterpart.Wow!What an improvement from the first floor gym that I got a few years ago.It's so cute.It has 10 toys: a seal squeaker toy, a lion stackable ring toy, a crinkly page book, an elephant, 2 monkeys and more: all totally cute.Best of all, it includes a boppy shaped pillow to support baby during back time.This went to a 5 month old who initially just laid on the mat and looked up with no reaction.Then the kicking and smiling began!If one hour can be interpreted as a final result ... this is a huge hit and will give her hours of entertainment.Great gift idea and high quality.I got this for my 2 month old baby.However the material is so slick he just slides right off of it.The material is slick, and not at all like regular boppy cotton covers.If the mini boppy had a cotton cover and could be tethered to the mat then I think this product would make a lot more sense.So, I know that, in general, Boppy means a well-made product.The Boppy Play Mat is of similar quality.It comes with a wipe-clean mat, smaller than the breastfeeding size boppy pillow, and three toys (a flower that makes crinkly noises, teething ring, and taggy ball).You can thread the toys through loops on the pillow, or attach them to a ring like thing on the mat.Now, having said all that, I didn't expect my little guy (4-1/2 months) to like it at all.He hates tummy time with a passion.We also have a tummy time gym (Playskool Let's Play Together Tummy Time Gym)--and that doesn't even help.So, I was totally shocked when he laid on his Boppy pillow and played with the toys for maybe 5 minutes.I know, I know... 5 minutes isn't a lot... but for us, it is.He actually really liked the crinkly sounds the toys made.He liked the ball and he liked the teether.You could also easily attach other toys.We have a bunch of Tiny Love toys from one of their Gymini mats--so used a few of those.The baby-sized boppy will also be good in a month or two when he starts to sit on his own.I tried using it now, but his weight sort of pushes it out of the way.The only criticism I have is that I wish that there was some sort of velcro on the mat and a way to fold everything up so it was easy to travel with.Yes, I can shove everything in a bag--but it would have been nice had it been designed with a travel mechanism.I will say that I've done tummy time with my eldest son, but never bothered to push it with my middle kids.All of them have crawled just fine--and right around the same time.Nope.But if you do want to do "tummy time", it really seemed to help my child.It also gives you a nice, washable mat to take for playing on at a friend's house, church, etc.My little guy has actually found new interest in our old tummy time gym simply by lying on the baby boppy from this play mat.If you're creative, I'm sure you could sew a similar sized pillow (or find one on Etsy)... but for those of us who have trouble hemming pants, thank God for the folks at Boppy.Fisher-Price has done it again with their Rainforest Deluxe High Chair!It is a quality product and provides an excellent value in terms of its longevity and utility.My daughter purchased this chair after trying one by Graco and finding it unsuitable for her son.Unlike the Graco, the back of the Fisher-Price Rainforest Deluxe High Chair is not so high as to bother the child using the chair.The colorful design on the chair appeals to little ones - yes, it is a bit bright, but then baby equipment usually is.The chair is easy to move.The plastic covering is easily cleanable; the piping appears to be a nylon, parachute-type material and is also easily cleanable.As one-year olds are prone to doing, he made an absolute mess of his cake.If the weather is warm, the chair's plastic covering can cause your little one to sweat quite a bit.I had considered taking the pad off the chair and using it as a pattern to make a quilted covering to place over the plastic.However, the necessity of removing it and washing it every day was enough to discourage that idea.The other issue I do have with the chair is that the wheels are not rubberized or coated with some type of material that will grip the floor.If you are using this chair on tile or hardwood, it can be scooted easily even when the wheels are locked.Because he sits at the table without the tray, our little one has discovered he can push off from the table and move his chair at will.Gripping, coated wheels would probably solve this problem.Of course, you can pay hundreds of dollars more for a sleek, contemporary high chair - but why would you.Little ones are, by nature, not the tidiest diners on the planet and a sturdy, easily cleaning high chair will trump expensive but less practical high chairs any day.I definitely recommend the Fisher-Price Rainforest Deluxe High Chair.Let me tell why I love this high chair, even though it's garish and looks like a baby took over our condo (well, he did).I was told by other moms in my moms' group that this was the chair to get, and they were right.It was fairly easy to put together, and once we had it, we've left it unfolded in our dining room.It has 7 height adjustments.The tray itself is a wonder - it snaps on and off, and has a removable insert that you can wash in the dishwasher.Without the insert, you can snap in a toy with lights and music (batteries not included).There is also a tiger teether tethered to the side of the tray.The biggest issue with babies when they eat is the mess.So the high priority for us was an easy to clean chair.The fabric doesn't have any crevices for food to get caught in, and we can wipe it clean with a moist paper towel.We did find food under the seat cover - assuming that happens on every chair, it's nice that it's easy to remove the cover.So, the only two problems with it that I could see are the bright, garish "child" look and feel that may not go well with your home decor (and to that, I say, it's nothing compared to the bouncer, the swing, the stationary play center, the toy bin, the push & go and so forth).Also, our son now points to the frog on the chair, so it's giving him some visual stimulation.The other problem for some people may be the size.It does fold up but unfolded it takes up the space of a dining room chair.For those people, I recommend a fisher price healthy care booster seat, like this one:Fisher-Price Precious Planet Healthy Care Booster.We used a tether to clip it to her bib, so it couldn't fall on the floor.Doesn't really have much use except to make it look your baby might be better snuggled by it?It cushions the baby without being cramp.I tried to adjust the length longer (the length is pretty much fixed, which i find dont fit the size/height of my baby) and was careless to expose the velcro.after a day of shopping my poor gal got her back of neck red & swollen.Not good if your baby tends to have heat rashes or gets hot easily.This is a wonderful product.This is a great addition to your car seat for infants.It snuggles them in so that their head doesn't bounce around.My babies were 2 months premature and it seemed like everything I sat them in something it was too big.This product was PERFECT!I can put it in the their swing, bouncy, and even lay it on the bed when they do nap time.I believe it gives them a sense of security since it does cradle their head and body so snug.It is also machine washable!To me this product is a must with any baby!As a nursing mom, I would prefer to use washable nursing pads to save money and decrease waste.But what options do we moms have?Each one offered slightly different products.I'm working to test each product I can get a sample of.I believe most products fit one or more specific needs."White/patterns" absorb a bit faster than "natural" so I like to put "natural" as an outer doubler and "white/patterns" as inner doubler during heavy let-downs.If you only drip a few drops during let-down any one of these brands would be fine.Read further if moderate to heavy let-downs are common.All products were machine washable, free samples, and pre-washed in hot or warm water and cold rinse at least once before use unless otherwise noted.No fabric softeners were applied as they can cause repelling.All samples were used at least a month before final opinions were noted.Categories: dry shirt test, rate of absoption, appearance, leakage, light use, heavy night use, doubler.Cotton/ Bamboo...?KUSHIES:Single layer/light use 4 starInner doubler 5 starOuter doubler 1

of this "eco-friendly" option.When it arrived, it came with a colored booklet that stated the product contained PVC...not my definiton of eco-friendly.The product seemed great otherwise, but that was my main criteria so it went back.And Dwinguler:  get rid of the PVC and you'd have a winner here!This is my favorite All In On diaper (AIO) because no stuffing is required.Definitely the sitter's favorite diaper, these are just as easy to use as disposables.With no bulky fabric to mess with, these look as sleek as a pocket diaper but there's NO STUFFING!You do not need to have Tommee Tippee bottles to use this product.I use it for my Avent sippy cups and breast pump parts and my playtex straw cups.I can take all of my summer and fall onesies and use them all winter.I had never used a side snapping diaper before this and was a little hesitant, now I'm glad I tried it!If this diaper had a little more room in the waist and thigh, I'd give it a 4-star rating.I normally sew my own but my son has outgrown his old diapers faster than I can find the time to sew new ones, so I've been looking for a few big cloth diapers to get by until I can replenish my stash of homemade diapers.This isn't it for me.Even though this diaper is supposed to go up to 40 pounds, I don't think it will unless you have a very slender, very tall child.My 11-month old is 25 pounds and 30" tall and needs it on the biggest setting.There's a bit of room in the waist and thigh but not much, especially around the thigh.My son has a chunky build, and I think he'll be able to wear this to 30 pounds - maybe 35 if I push it.On the flip side, if you're buying this for a newborn, it should fit well from day one because it has such a slim fit and is very trim for a cloth diaper (will put up a picture soon).Pros:-Very trim fit for jeans and tighter clothing-High quality construction-Soft material-Cute colors-Easy to use snap sizing system-Natural and Organic Fabrics-Snaps down very small.The smallest setting would have fit my son as a 6-pound newborn in the rise, waist, and thigh from day one.-The insert is trim and absorbent and would be good to use in other diapers.Cons:-After one washing, the fleece lining looked terrible-Not as "stay dry" feeling as my homemade dipes (I use 200 weight Malden Mills fleece)-The wide part of the insert goes in the back instead of the front, which doesn't make much sense-Not absorbent enough for overnight or naps (my son is heavy wetter)-Not much room for extra stuffings-Very slim fit.It's a little bit loose but the next smallest waist snap is way too tight and the rise is fine as is.-The fleece gussets are prone to compression leaks and also make the leg opening a tight fit.Bottom line?If your chunky baby is over 6 months, you probably won't get much use out of it.If you have a heavy wetter or want to use it for sleeping, riding in the car, going out, etc., look elsewhere.If you're buying this for a newborn or a slender baby, go for it.If you want something to grab to wear under tighter outfights, this is the one.Still not sure?I'll keep the one I opened mainly for any future children, but I'm returning the closed one.It was a little pricier than I wanted to spend, but I finally just gave in.It is so cute on him.He wore it for around 3 hours, no leaks (which is what I normally change at).Currently I always just use Kissa fitteds and Disana wool at night.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is how long it takes to stuff the pocket!I would not want to own more than 2 or 3 of these for that reason.The insert took forever to get flat and in place.As another person mentioned it takes longer than other pockets to dry, but that is not a big deal to me really.The snaps are a little odd, but I am using it for a child about to turn 1.From all I have read, that would be for if I was using it for a newborn, so I don't need to worry about that extra row of outward snaps!Try this dipe; I think you will like it!Just don't make your whole stash up of them, as you will NOT like stuffing them!Unfortunately, the mother turtle is very stiff, so when water gets in, it's impossible to squeeze it all out.Actually, it's impossible to squeeze a good bit of it out.Even after stepping on the large turtle with both feet, you can hear the water sloshing around inside.Which means eventually mold is going to build up inside.Not a very healthy thing for a child's toy.Pass on this toy; it's even worse than the typical one's that can take in water.I purchased 2 kits to secure a gate to the banisters at the top of our stairs.The kit was easy enough to install, although installation is easier with an extra set of hands.We had to maneuver the brackets around a bit to make sure that the gate mounts were screwing into the kit's brackets.It took a little work but all in all, not too bad.We worked on it a few times while moving in, so my guess is about an 1 hour for installation but not more than 2 hours.I give this product 4 stars mainly because of the price which I feel is a little high considering that I needed to purchase 2 kits and then a separate mountable gate.All things considered I would purchase it again and would recommend it to anyone who needs a gate mounted to a banister.Was a great idea, looked cute, and I was very happy to have it on hand when my little one recently decided to start trying to stand up in the tub, and grab at things such as the spout.Well, my husband and I went to blow up the spout cover tonight and the valve won't stay closed AT ALL, not even for a few seconds!This means the cover is totally useless and I won't get a single use out of it.It's cheap plastic, I know, I didn't even necessarily expect it to last that LONG, but to find it won't hold air for even a single use is ridiculous and a total waste of money/wasted gift.Extremely disappointed.Debating whether to contact the manufacturer and waste my time over a $5-6 item.Never had a valve that wouldn't close at all like this, no excuse for that level of poor construction.I am so glad we got this spout cover!We had a different one before that would NOT stay on my tub spout, slid off several times during each bath!The only issue I had with this one, the cover to where you inflate it didn't stay closed well, so I just cut it and it worked perfectly!We've had this item for about 2 months now and my son has bumped his head a couple of times and he doesn't even know it!It is very soft!I'm not a big fan of jewelry on babies but it looks cute [it can also be tucked under the clothing if you don't want it to show] and she doesn't even seem to notice it is there.I will definitely be buying these as baby gifts and recommending them to friends!My daughter began teething at 8 weeks [she is now 11 weeks] so I was worried it might be too big or that she would pull on it but it fits well and she hasn't noticed it so far!Bottom line: this is a nice product for a good price and I appreciate the service I received.I gave this exersaucer 3 stars for "average or ordinary".I had one 6 years ago with my older child and I liked its simplicity.The new exersaucers use way too many batteries (12 for this one) for the electronic toys that don't do much but make buzzing noise or short tunes.They are big bulky chunks of plastic.The 3-1 wasn't useful as a play mat nor stable in the stage 3.The ABC-123 was UGLY.The Baby Einsteins also had too many big bulky plastic electronic toys and not enough interactive ones.So I decided on this one.Here is what I think.Pros: It's smaller then others.It is adorably cute.Cons: Two bulky electronic toys that don't do much other then buzz and play very short tunes.The way I see it the arc just takes precious room and uses two holes that could be better used for switch-a-roos.Specs: 2 holes for switch-a-roos if you are using the arc (the apple and dragon fly can be taken out), or 4 holes for switch-a-roos if you take the arc out.Frogy electronic toy doesn't do much - the kid can push his head down and his arms will flap.The second electronic toy has a mouse and a carrot and works as see-saw, when mouse is up, the carrot is down and vice versa.The apple is a rattle.The dragon fly is supposed to be a chewy but it's  not flexible enough and doesn't droop enough for my baby (4 months) to reach it.Maybe when he's older.My favorite part is the green froggy seat with spongey back.It makes me feel better to think that baby's back is protected.I do have to put a blanket around his waste so he's more comfortable and sits upright, but in a few months that won't be necessary.I put two pillows underneat his feet because he's too small.I think it was a good choice for us, but looking back I can't help but wonder if ABC-123 would have been better choice (does it have real songs rather then short sounds?does it have more toys?does it have more room for switch-a-roos?).It was not too difficult to assemble.You'll need a philips screwdriver and 30 minutes of your time.It does not fold!They are very stable.This exersaucer has one slot that can be used for snacks (cheerios?)Since it needs a toy that's easier to chew/teeth on, I got a fish switch-a-roo.The feet at the bottom make it more stable, and we're using them now until he's old enough to do serious bouncing.The electronic toys have off-soft-loud settings and the soft setting is lound enough for baby but not lound enough to annoy a parent.I guess my main problem with the exersaucer is that I find toys bulky, boring and not interactive enough.I would have liked toys that crinkle, droop, are tied to the exersaucer (my old one had a phone that was tied and the butterfly that was chewable).One extra toy we got in this exersaucer was a rattle that looks like a bird nest with eggs inside.It's cute and fun and I can see it becoming a favorite on this toy.I only wish I could find more in stock.They hold up quite well, and I've rarely had any leakage with these - usually from not putting it back well, but also from wearing it too long (16hr trip).I'm an ER nurse and we use temporal artery thermometers in our ER.DO NOT LIFT the thermometer at all!!!2.repeat this 2 more times3.take the HIGHEST of the 3 readings.clean the head of the thermometer with a Q-tip and some alcohol occasionally to help it read accurately.5.In this case, it is better to run the thermometer over their carotid artery on their neck- off to the side of the voicebox.The reason is that it's a very quick and unobtrusive way of getting a temperature reading- for your kids and yourself.This is the same type of device most hospitals use on newborns.Also, if one is sweating, the device can give incorrect readings, so it's good to have a backup ear/oral/rectal thermometer if in doubt.I was tired of the under-arm thermometers.I read about this product and decided to get it.I use it on my baby, toddler and ourselves.I'm paranoid about it being consistent so I always take 3 sequential readings.As long as I properly swipe the forehead (proper place, no hair, no sweat), the readings are extremely close to each other.The only good thing I can say about this thermometer is that it was a good idea.Unfortunately, it is so inaccurate, it might as well have a software program embedded that generates a random number between 93 and 100 because every time my husband and I tried to use it (on ourselves or our baby, fast or slow, left or right, up or down, holding button at various intervals, etc.), it never gave even close to the same reading twice.Contrary to what another reviewer believes, we are capable in every other aspect of our lives; we do not have "an IQ of 60", so I believe the thermometer is what's lacking here, not our intelligence.I hate the thought of sticking a thermometer in my poor baby's mouth, ear, or anywhere else, so I was excited when someone gave me this as a shower gift.But when it comes to my child's health, I need to know if she actually has a fever or not and how high it is every single time.I guess it's rectal for us.This is a very handy tool to have.I must say that the last thing that I want to do when my little one feels sick is to take his temperature rectally.This product is used in lots of hospitals and was given to us as a gift after a family friend had a hospital stay.As some other posters have mentioned, it takes some practice to get the hang of it.As far as improvements, I would love if this product had a swivel in the head part of it to make getting the right angle easier.This thermometer is so great that I can take my son's temperature without waking him up.However, I have to run out of his room into the hallway to read it since it isn't backlit.All in all, a great product.Our one year old son recently got a nasty stomach virus that was accompanied by a high fever.We still had the one from our doctor and decided to compare readings.Almost every time the readings were exactly the same or off by .1 degree.The thermometer was so easy to use that we were mad at ourselves for not buying one sooner.With this he just lays in bed and lets us swipe it accross his forehead.He kind of thinks it's a game =)I have not been able to measure the temperature with this device.I tried it on myself, my spouse, and my baby.Each time the temperature reading was different and completely off from a normal temperature when all three of us were healthy.I can't imagine using it when the baby is actually sick.When you have a sick kid the last thing they want to do is sit there with something jambed into their ear or stuck under their tongue.Run the thermometer across the forhead and that is all you have to do.This is a good little mat for a diaper bag.It's soft fleece on one side, which wicks any liquid away from the baby's skin (helpful, as my DD likes to pee as soon as her diaper comes off!), and waterproof fabric on the other side.It can be folded into a small bundle to be put into the diaper bag.It is also all fabric, rather than part vinyl, which means that trying to fold it and put it in a side pocket of a diaper bag can be difficult one-handed if the pocket is designed for a stiffer pad.This is our third baby and our third attempt to find a car seat support system that works.It is no way near as flimsy or thin as the others!!!GOOD:* It is thicker than any other we have found and so soft!I seriously want one for myself :)* It covers way more space than most* It is easy to place and fits our Graco car seat with no problems* Easy to clean* Our has never shifted.... even the head piece stays put!BAD:* It is thicker than all the other ones we have purchased which is good and bad since we live in HOT Houston, Texas which is 100 degrees in the summer and 95% humidity.Still even with our heat index we would not trade this seat cushion for nothing.It's really a cute print, and it's very big!Also, it's not one of those stiff mats.It's very soft but still has the waterproof lining to protect from messes.The total height is 13.5", though you'd need some space above that to allow the mist to flow.It's hard to find a good option - most people want the Chevy Suburban of humidifiers, it seems, with the biggest tank and the most humidification possible, so that's all that seems to be available.The tank is surprisingly large for the size of the humidifier - about 0.75 gallons.At the maximum flow setting, it lasts about 10.5 hours, so it should be able to handle about 1.7 gallons per 24 hours if you refill it.Of course, at a lower setting it would last longer.You want to change the water often anyway to reduce bacterial growth, so there's no point in having a bigger tank than you need for one day.For big rooms, though, you might want to consider something like the slightly largerCrane Humidifier, which also comes in green and pink versions; or something even larger.WELL DESIGNED:  As mentioned, the design doesn't waste space.And the mist flows out through two spouts at the top which can be aimed in different directions or the same direction, to distribute the humidity or aim it where you'd like it to go.That also helps make it easier to find a location for this humidifier.)QUIET:  This model isn't silent but it is quiet - especially if it's several feet away.VARIABLE MIST:  The variable mist feature lets you adjust the flow to allow for the room size and the weather conditions, so you don't have a room that's too damp or too dry.You end up having to guess how much to fill it up so that it runs out of water before stuff starts to grow on the walls.)With this Safety 1st humidifier, after a little experimenting you can determine what setting will keep the room at a healthy humidity.(If you're getting a wet spot on the floor nearby, you have the humidifier turned up too high - it's more water than the air can absorb.)This humidifier puts out a pretty impressive stream of fog on the maximum setting.SAFETY 1ST:  You might not be familiar with Safety 1st, but they are a well-known maker of products for babies and children.If you go to a Target store looking for this, you'll need to look in the section of the store with the baby and toddler gear.It wasn't stocked with the other humidifiers in the store I visited.A FEW SMALL ISSUES:  There are a few minor issues, but they won't be problems for most people:- The feet are hard plastic, so if it's on a smooth surface you might want to add some non-skid feet of your own, or put it on a non-skid liner, to keep it from sliding.- While the flow of mist is variable, it seems not to go off completely at the lowest setting.We don't have hard water, but do use filtered water to fill the humidifiers - it cuts way down on the amount of brown gunk that builds up.By the way, the way the feet are arranged on the base, this could fit on a space as narrow as about 5.5" x 6.5" inches.But again, you might want to add something to keep it from sliding around if space is tight.Many stores sell self-adhesive rubber bumpers or feet, or you could place it on non-skid shelf liner.ULTRASONIC HUMIDIFIERSThere are a few pros and cons common to all ultrasonic humidifiers, like this one.Finally, and most importantly, whatever is in the tank will go into the air - that includes bacteria and minerals.So ultrasonic humidifiers need maintenance - you need to clean them regularly.Buy this only if you can get free return and you don't know if your oven is compatible with it.This wasn't compatible with our oven door in the desired location as shown, which is in the top center of the door, so I have it sideways on the right side.The tape is strong enough that after a couple of mistakes and re-sticking it, it still holds strong.However, because we have it on the right side and sideways, I don't know how long it will last.My kid hasn't shown an interest in it after the first couple of times of trying to pull the oven door (it didn't open), so so far, it works!My toddler got in the habit of opening all kitchen cabinets, and then it came the dishwasher, and of course then he discovered the oven.That day I came to amazon.com and bought this product.I put it on my oven as soon as I got it.It uses a glue to stick to the door, so I thought it would not be there for too long, but my little one has tried and tried to open it since and hasn't been able to move it a bit.I bought this based on the mostly good reviews it received...and kept my fingers crossed.I thought I was going to be disappointed because it fell off a few times in the first night...mostly because we were playing with it.But, after given a little time to adhere, it hasn't fallen off since then.It is a tight fit with our oven handle, but there is room, so we can manage.The one thing I don't like is that when you lift it up to open the oven door, it doesn't stay up.This means it gets in the way when you try to close the oven door again.You have to grab it and hold it up, which can get a little toasty on the fingers.The adhesive didn't stick to the wood.Very poor design.Upon opening the package, I noticed that the way the mechanism attaches to the oven is by double-sided adhesive.Not only does this seem a bit flimsy, I was worried that it might set off fumes when the oven is in use.I didn't think the adhesive would have been strong enough to withstand a t30 pound toddler pulling on it.Also, should this stick to the oven, how would I get it off when I no longer need the lock?But poor design aside, I couldn't even use it on my oven if I wanted to.I have a KitchenAid model and apparently, the handle on the door is what is preventing the mechanism from working.In order for it to work, you need to be able to push the gray locking piece from side-to-side, but if the handle on your oven door is too high up, then it blocks your access to the piece.From the packaging you can't tell how the product works, and there is no description to help you either - just trial and error.Our nursery has NO smell whatsoever.My coffee table fits within the measurements that this product says it works for...WRONG!WRONG again!I tried both sizes and neither worked.This product can be workable or not.It works OK on our upstairs toilet, but for some reason, it will not work on our downstairs toilet--and they are the same models!It definitely keeps our little one out of the toilet, but there have got to be better designs out there.It's a bit bulky and rather loose-fitting which is disappointing.The other reviews are exactly right.This is impossible to squeeze - and when you finally do manage to compress it, it has no suction.I might as well have thrown my money out the window.I don't understand how stroller makers get away with making the shades so small!I saw a review say it wasn't good int he wind and I have to agree that it's not that strong.But, it's better then having nothing and if it's that windy, you probably won't be outside very long anyway.This sun protecter is great!I bought this sunshade after doing extensive research on internet.I am able to fold shade down, still attached to stroller when i dont not need the shade and also folding the stroller with the shade NO PROBLEM!!I dont understand why there is reviews that stated the shade MUST be removed before folding the stroller?very goodone negative is that once it is set-up, it is difficult to move it across the room without it falling apartother negative is that is is quite small -- we had to buy two and join them to ensure that there was enough room for a 10 month old to move around and not feel "trapped"It took me all of 3 minutes to put this together.The plastic is hollow but sturdy and even though the plastic "cups" on the bottom don't suction to the floor like I thought/hoped they would, I don't think it's possible for a baby to push this thing around.I'm glad I bought this over the other wooden options out there.She has plenty of room for herself&bulky electronic toys&little friend& both adults.My hub is at work all the time and my relatives are too far, and no money for a babysitter.Now he hates it as it limits his "exploring territory".That can be quite annoying sometimes.We found next solution for it - put a sticker on holes where the music comes from.We didn't buy any extensions for it, it seems pretty expensive for us.We just connect it to our sofa and tv table (opposite the house wall) to expand it.If you are breastfeeding you HAVE to get these!Put them in the fridge before you use them.WONDERFUL product!My son is 4-months old (16 pounds) and these toys are too large for him to hold and too large for him to chew on.The banana is the smallest but its so thick that he can't do much with it.We bought these because my son is teething and I wanted something organic.My son will probably be able to use these in a month or two so I'll update my post then.They're flexible to use just about anywhere (kitchen cabinets, fridge door, glass cabinets - you name it).Installation is a breeze.And they still hold very well.I don't know how long the glue will last, but it's been a couple of months, and so far, no one has been able to pull them off.One other comment: Before patching the entire house with these things, I installed one, and then tried removing it to see whether the glue left any marks.There was no residue left.(You do need to use a wet sponge with soap, but it did get it all off - great knowing when your kids grow up, and you want your house to be adult-friendly again.)I love this product!It is very simple, does not require drilling, and simply works.They work really well on my freezer, my closet that has rolling doors, and my drawers that don't work well with the normal childproof latches.I could see some older children figuring this out very quickly, but for now, things are safe from my toddler!While a lot of people will tell you can just use a kitchen towel, and they would be right, this is definitely better.The organic cotton is soft and durable.It has held up fabulously under repeated washings (had mine for 7 months now) and they appear to be somewhat stain resistant.They are long (like a dish towel) which is great when baby spits up over your shoulder, since it catches it for a distance.As a result, I would highly recommend these burp cloths.I am so relieved that they sell these parts individually.I was panicked to reach in my Garbage Disposal after is was making 'that noise' to find that this part of my pump was now finely diced!(The White Membrane did escape unscathed however!)I got mine for $5.70something with free shipping!Great product!It does not take up half the bathroom as the horseshoe shaped potty step stool surrounds the base of your toilet and adults don't need to move the Looster aside when it is their turn to use the toilet.
