In this part, I develop the context-free grammar that can parse all the following sentences. 
(a) “We had a nice party yesterday” 
(b) “She came to visit me two days ago”  
(c) “You may go now” 
(d) “Their kids are not always naive" 
And using Python environment to test your grammar to make sure that it does the job.
